"Yes feminism is right..
But taking its misadventures is wrong like in lakhnow case in you tube they may have not supported the girl but can u guarantee that if may had slapped her back they have supported,even the people had come in favour of girl if man had slapped first and they themselves had kicked a guy had anyone did anything to girl..
Y reservation if u are supporting faminisum and asking for equal rights ,y u didn't support uniform civil code,y u didn't have that guts to speak on that..?being selective is easy"
Hmm😊

"P,, n वीडियो की सच्चाई दिखाओ लोग पागल बन रहे है"
Bhaiya  Mai thoda let ho gaya lekin mujhe ye puchhna tha ki ye feminism aur  patr................ aur mat............... Ye sab kaha se jana jay education ke bare me ek video banaiye jisme ki education ke kis field me kya hai full details me video banaiye 😢 Mai agar koi videos  dekhta hu to mujhe  lagta hai ki mujhe ye karna chahiye dusri dekhta hu to lagta hai mujhe  ye banna chahiye  wo banna chahiye please request hai aapse
"I’ve been a viewer of this channel for a very long time and I really like the content, but today while going through this video I was waiting for the point when you’d talk about an issue called ‘pseudo feminism’ but I guess you missed out on that, it’s been known to everyone that how a lot of men have also fallen victim to this issue including myself. 
Dhruv I’ve been a true supporter of your work and that’s why I’m sharing my true feedback that it was a little disappointing for me as I was expecting that you would discuss the issue of ‘pseudo feminism’ in this video as well."
Really video ke start me mai bhi galat side wale feminism ke mindset se soch rha tha lekin end hone ke baad samajh aya asli matlab thanks for this equality of knowledge and explanation
"Which is why in Islam, women are treated like Queens👑

To those who still have doubts, please do visit any Islamic countries and see how they treat their wife😊"
ek hi dil hein. kitne bar jitoge yaar?
according to Dhruv ...Vishwa Hindu parishad Aurto ki rights chin leta he...lekin saudi arabia aur afghanistan...iran jese desh o me aurto ki saari rights he @Dhruvrathee 4:59
Yes in swadhyay parivar pandurang shastri ji ne bhi bahot kaam kiya he .unho ne bhi  familism  parivar khade kiye hai 😊
It's simple: live and let live everyone with dignity and respect.

"Feminism is never about equality, It's for power and vengeance,

If they're granted equality then they will cry to death,

Men are mentally weak and easy manipulated but since they have set the false narrative of strong you will never believe that all you have is a false sense of control bros, Open your eyes bros."
"Idk why but i am getting a feeling that this video was biased an Dhruv spoke about the dark side of mens, but didn't about the dark side of womens and how mens have been harrassed or tortured mentally by the society and females for even the smallest of things like having a seat or slight push due to braking in public transport"
Best video i have ever seen❤
Strongly believe 💯
"This society now needs a modern solution because modern problem requires mordern solution . Society needs equaliism more than femalism because feminism only highlights women's equal rights and society forgets about men's rights . And just like in the video stated that some Alfa's are definiting femanism in wrong way but there are also some ' feminists ' definiting feminism in wrong ways . Like "" Always respect a woman ."" It's seems like mantioning that no matter how a woman act rude , as a man , he should treat her respectfully . ( That's what some Alfa's and ' Femanists ' think ) ( as an example )"
You didn't understand neena gupta's point of view. She didnt say woman are less than man. She meant to say we arent equal. She didnt mean that women cant earn or shouldn't earn.
"1:27 SUCH A GOOD POINT. This is what needs to be implemented in our minds more. It's not men vs women, no do us women want authority over men. It's about EQUALITY. Not treat someone differently on the basis of their gender. The division is not between genders it's between people who understand equality and basic human rights for both genders, and people who simply don't."

Thanks to speak truth
"Women want equality in the workforce but only in positions of power and influence. Why don't they want equality in the terms of workers, military, garbage cleaners ?"
Having a real time conversation with dhruv rathi would be great in trye sense. Wish all people would have this mindset
Legendary author like Salman Rushdi??????😂😂😂😂
"Sara khela samaj ka hai, jisko Dharm, literature, media aur vicharo sey banta hai. 
Jab kanoon barabar baney aur kanoon barabar Lagu ho tou iski zarurat nahi hoti.
In sab ki zimmedari State par hota hai, lekin koi bhi scholars apney state ko failure aur sponsor kehney sey darta hai.
Patriarchy aur Faminism created by State sponsor thought."
"If feminism actually means equal opportunities for both men and women, regardless of outcomes, I support it. But the problem is the word itself is creates misconceptions. Whenever someone hears the word 'feminism' the first thing that comes to his mind is something only dedicated to the 'female team' of the human race."
"बिल्कुल सही कहा महिलाए खुद अपने ही अधिकारो के लिए सजग नही है।
भारत मे महिलाओ को महानता की देवी बनने की सीख दी जाती है।यही कारण है कि उसे इंसान न समझा जाता।
देवी बनाया इस अति ने उसको 
फिर गलती कोई क्षम्य कहा।
वस्तु बनाया इस अति ने उसको
फिर कोई चाहत मान्य कहा।"
matriarchy ≠ feminism

how about you Rathee?
I have seen more patriarchal women in my surroundings than feminist women
Fine but you're still not talking about pseudo feminism
Women were given equal rights.. movement started in 70s.. Behind the movement was Rothschild family.. reason was to get other half (females) to start working and pay taxes $s.. As men & women work kids are left to be raised by state... This is the master plan by those to control the world... They are running their narrative.. sad but true.. society is crumbling.. you can ignore this comment or open your eyes and look deep
"""Men and women are equal but not identical """

और मैं बस एक ही बात कहना चाहता हूं कि भाई पूरी अगर दुनिया ऐसी है या फिर 90% लोग कैसे हैं तो हम क्या करें तुम्हारा फिल्म भी ऐसे ही बन रहा है हमारा फिल्म भी ऐसे ही बन रहा है हमारा कलर ही ऐसी है तुम्हारे घर पर घर में और जितने भी लोग है डॉक्टर को जो भी है सारे ऐसे ही है तो हम क्या करें भाई अकेले
आपका वीडियो देखकर मैं सीखने की कोशिश करता हूं पर उसका चैनल देखकर कभी-कभी मुझे दिल में दर्द होने लगता है कि भाई मैं हमेशा सच का साथ देता हूं मैं हमेशा परफेक्ट कोशिश करता हूं हर टाइम बस अपने गोल्ड पर फोकस करता हूं और वह सिर्फ क्या करता है पुराना वीडियो उठना है दूसरे का म्यूजिक डाला और अपलोड किया और भाई 25 से 30000 सब्सक्राइबर्स कर रहा है फिर भी और मैं यहां पर अच्छे से वीडियो बना रहा हूं खुद से कांटेक्ट बना रहा हूं मैं भाई क्या करूं मैं आप मेरी प्रॉब्लम को समझ रहे हो मैं कमेंट बात नहीं पा रहा हूं
मैं जब अपने बड़े भाई को यह सब दिखाने की कोशिश करता हूं तो मना कर देता है नहीं देखा वह अपना थ्योरी इस्तेमाल करने लग जाता है हम दोनों भाई का दो यूट्यूब चैनल है जिसमें अगर मैं बोलता हूं कि हां भाई सारा कुछ सिक्के तब तैयार करते हैं तब आगे बढ़ते हैं नहीं उसको सिर्फ उसका चैनल दिखता है देख मैं तो गोरा हो रहा हूं ऐसे ही करके
ध्रुव भाई आपके तो की ज्यादातर लोग ऐसे ही हैं फिल्म भी ऐसे ही बना रहे हैं तुम्हारे घर में भी ऐसे ही लोग हैं तो हम क्या करें अगर पूरी दुनिया ही ऐसी है तो हमक्या करें

"Chapri refers to the Chapparband caste. It is a class and caste based slur. Most slurs and insults in India are rooted in caste. I believe that using chapri as an insult or adjective is not politically correct.

"These dishonest people who are giving the wrong image and meaning of feminism know very well that Economics/Finance is the greatest power and giving equal rights to women will give equal power and position and financial stability to women making it almost impossible to enslave them in societal or cultural based system , no wonder we see them always opposing, they know the game rules."

Dhruv vai today its undeniably boys friendship is far stronger then women but at the end of the day boys drown themselves in the periotic systems
In flight of equal rights now Day's women have become the old stereotypical patriotic kind
"If you tell a man you are feminists, he would say can i kick and punch you then?"
I think I should convert to ISLAM and get married to a MUSLIM WOMEN . Atleast They are Not doing this and are properly raising family and Giving birth to babies and have a loving family and support their husbands . No wonder I ADMIRE ISLAM . While others keep doing toxic gender bias 🤌🤌🤌. Hit like if you are a true muslim .Remember Quran is a POWERFUL BOOK
Beautiful explanation.Appreciable 😊
Short answer yes it is
Bilkul sahi

Is bat ko daba diya ja rha hai, ise ab paise kmane ka jariya bana liya hai, mere pas bhut proof hai but in baton ko bole to ladies ke khilaf hain ye bola jayega magar ye truth hai, aj kal ye dhanda bna liya hai hazaro ladies ne. Achi ladies par bhi koi ykeen nhi karega ane wale time mein. Agar yu hi  chalta rha to. Pta nhi tum mera msg padoge ke nhi. Par main hmesha tumhare sath hu. Ur great ❤"
"I think "" Feminism "" the word itself is the problem. This ideology should be given another name because the first meaning a men derives is by reading the word only not their definition. The word is derived from female and in india ik people dont look for the definition they just make assumptions that its about female rights only . A simple renaming of this ideology will be game changing i swear."

bhai andrew tate ke bare me battao
"Ahh another ""we dont need men"" type of supporter- and what did you say? ""No feminist support those kind of women"" Bhai go and see those comments then you will understand everything CLEARLY- Yep another day another men getting blamed"
Nora said women's should stay in their limits when nd later when she was questioned about her choice of cloths she accused them of bad mentality nd of backwards thinking 😂 nd said we dont need feminism when she was sitting there only because feminism exist and would've been killed already for doing the things she do nd things she wear
He's girls fav Indian guy 😂
"I finally understand what feminism is , What my english teacher has always tried to tell me about."
"Not ""Jyotiba Fule"", ""Mahatma Fule""."
"No bro sorry your one information is wrong about when feminism started. Not in 1980's it was in the 6th century. The first ever modern state, state of Madina where rights were given to women men all equal. Children rights aged people rights etc these everything was introduced first time there. And all devil's forces are still against that system. That system is the system of Quran system of Islam System given to us by our Creator."
Women and men are equal. The balance should be equal. Some places where women got priorities and in some places men got. Thats how they are equal rights. Equal rights doesn't mean tomorrow a man demands to get pregnant. Or woman start demanding to make another woman pragnant etc. When you buy a kilo of rice to balance it you use stone of 1 kilo on other side you dont balance it with another kilo of rice on other side of balance.
Feminism is the most misused term.
You are amazing person sir in this fake world❤
"Most of the ppl here in comments/replies really are the biggest idiots in the planet🌍.. Despite his points in this video... Ur not even listening and just came here to hate him... I am not really a fan of him but his points were factual and true... Yet majority of u guys can't even understand such simple thongs and just disagree because the person talking is dhruv rathee... Grow up ppl... Grow tht brain of urs,"
Outstanding vedio everyone should watch this
You are a real man 💪
@harshalibetal
as a muslim we dont want to disrespect women but the main thing is that we dont want to give tough time to our females we just want toh eat drink and merry we want them to enjoy in home without doing any hardwork thats all
Oi dhruvv jaa kar dekh indian larki kitna badnaam h …
Stay safe. Your videos are so valuable. ❤❤❤
Hats off to you for speaking the truth!! True feminist support male & female gender
Comment for better reach
Dealing problems on your own makes you stronger ❤️ bro

"But why isn't there anything from you at all about the Kolkata case? Be it Youtube, Instagram or Twitter?"

And i will talk about the education system that is getting worse everyday i am not saying that woman should be illiterate but there should not be coeducational system nowadays because of the worst situations of university
"I've been looking for actual meaning of feminism
But found much more info in this video
This video opened my mind on spiritual level 🤯
Learned Many things today
Thanks man 😊"
Dhruv sir i am your big fan but the man is always less emotional than a woman that makes a man stronger to survive and be there for closed ones. Literally this is my observation and i have found that 95% of woman who start earning they claim that i earn by myself i do by myself I don’t need anyone in my life even though she always disrespects his husband if she starts earning herself. And man always thinks about his family his closed ones first after earning
meine jobless khudko socha tha
Feminist are those who support false case fillings against men. As per NCRB data only 20 percent of 498a i.e harrasment of women for dowry lead to conviction... 80 percent cases are false.. Legal Extortion as denoted by supreme court. HOW YOU DIFFERENTIATE THEAE FEMINIST  to othera.. see the es head of NCW  Swati Maliwal who falsely complained against her father against AAP official
🎉🎉🎉
bro aadivasi oil real hai ya fake please bro video banao

You’re real for this

fir toh india ke laws bhi matriarchal hai

"I want you to talk about LGBT community. Please DHRUV sir INDIA literally want to know about this thing. Not only These alpha males are making fun of feminism or feminist but also LGBT. We, all want your voice for. ❤ You are the only person who can change the mindset of these people. I hope you will make it."
Thank you for making this video. It cleared a lot of things for me too.
@dhruvrathee sir ap equal payment ki bat karte ho AJ kal to females KO double pay milti hai males ke muqable main........ Pehle to jobs preference main hi ladkion Ka Likha HOTA hai job mil Jaye to salary NH milti lekin agar larki ho personal secretary receptionist ya koi BH job to males ke muqable 3 times ziada salary milti hai
wonderfull vedio
The solution is islam
Finally a worthy video
Dhruv jara check krle cheating rate kis gender ki jada h fir bak bak kariyo
Dhruv will be Dhruv ❤
"Sir,I think  you miss the of Begum  Rokeya from bangladesh.She is also want womens wright.❤
Btw I am a big fan of you❤"
Very good. Thanks
How can you say sulman Rushdie is legendary writer.I hope you care about muslims sentiments.
"I want to add one more point dhruv. 
I see around and notice that in most of the cases the husband died and the wife is alive after him for maybe 5-25 years. I feel that this is also because of patriarchy. Men Don't share their emotions as they are taught to be strong and God knows what. So they keep it with them. Hence it affects their health. Stress and heart attack whereas a woman is over expressive. Sharing her things with almost everyone. So she doesn't carry this load on her mind and body. Hence live long. 
Waiting for your thoughts on thia"
Great video Dhruv! Facts spoken.
"Bro Bahut tough hai ye equality Lana , baat sirf mindset ki nahi hai it’s much more than that, Male fir bhi feminist hote hai but mostly female sirf jo un k liye  positive side hai usko pakad rakhte hai like they wanna do which men’s Do , but they don’t wanna do which men suffers or sacrifice"
11:18 like me 😔
Only this kind of thinking in people can make the world a better place!!
Good sir
I have grown up in the “feminist North Korea” aka Norway. I can tell you that feminism is evil. The problem is when you give women high positions they become arrogant and selfish. Women in high positions like to rule because it’s benefits their own egos. I have seen it with my own eyes and India should not do the same stupid mistakes we in the west have done.
"China,USA,Russian and Europe struggling to bring back women home.
family system end there, due to this equal drama.
these countries run by asian who still have family system alive.
In asia we know what women should do and what men should do and good news is it's working."
"No feminist hv supported the violence against men but no feminist hv criticized the same.
Keeping silent is one kind of support towards feminism against men. 
Situation if get vise versa went a men hits a women and all the feminist will support the women but no feminist will support or speak a word against the women when she do the same.
So, being silent is kind of being supportive to such act. 
So call feminist..."
"Absolutely love this video!
i've insane respect for you dhruv, your perspective on this & about women is truly appreciative & raised standards💗"
"That is not a feminism that is showed today, it is a feminazism. Trust me this will end bad for all of us, especially for women."
"Weak people use tradition, culture and religion to suppress the one who is capable. Tell abp to read the right garud puran and specify the meaning properly before bashing a puran. Fear of shame is a business now. Once heard a sentence ""we as a society  are goign retard"" I can definitely feel it now. I only see these important discussions either on yt, twitter or comment section but on regular life people are either quite, suppressed or the one who wants to have a debate for positive change Will be avoided, everybody wants change but they won't work for it."
"I’m a man, I’m honestly neutral on these subjects. But, the problem arises when there is an exponential rise in Pseudo Feminism. Then someday or the other, even if I don’t want to I tilt towards being a patriarch."
"Nice video, but laga tha main topic toxic feminism main focus hoga. Maybe kyu ye ek situation ban raha hai 😅😅"
Agree 💯
"Today i know about the real difference between matriarchy and feminism. Earlier, i thought feminism was considered to be matriarchy."
"in the name of feminism world is facing toxicity higher divorce ratio higher SINGLE MOM ratio and low marriage ratio, if your mentally feminine, you cannot expect everyone to be the same majority follows masculinity and it is hard to be masculine cause it requires alot of hard work, and if you say TOXIC masculinity there is no such thing as that, and last but not the least point out a country where you see higher rates of feminism and the govt laws are according to feminism MEN in those countries run away from there, INSTANTLY, it's HAPPENING have a look at america men do not wanna get settled with an american woman, the movement started MGTOW communities like RED PILL, have a look of the deep side you cannot act like a robot bring out history while the real effects are showing in present, a smart man like you leaving loop holes, sad"
"For the diversty,rights should be given diverse;
And if there is something like equal rights then there will be,""equal fights"".
It whould not be qouta but merit into the race.
And though,war and politics strategies are in the genes of  man as they have suffered and gone throughout the history.
So a man wouldnt let his wife fight against a predator because she is weak and not made for that.
Look,this world is example for those who believe in absolute feminism,
            ""Women are more in numbers than male and have remained like that so why they have not the leadership of the world ""and this makes clear that the one who is made for what,will do better in that and thats why woman are better in parenting and household and the man is better in earning and protection.
Both are leaders at the time.
Women should have the equal rights but in the sense of judiciary and votes,and in those where equality can place its feet.
Actually it should not be equality given but accurate equality,accorfing to the measure."
"While there is a need to break the social norms and rules in almost all cultures western … European, middle eastern or Asian …. It is a fact that it is used to promote capitalism and disintegrate human values ."
This man need 1vs1 conversation against Jordan Peterson
Why do people hate on Dhruv? Nothing he says is illogical! Huh
Exilant ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This video should be on national tv
Aap itny achi.nature k kesy ho bhai u r so sweet
"Feminism is right (as defined by the author of the video) and women and men are equal because both have minda and can think. And we are talking about equality at that level -- not anatomy, physical strength or reproductive capacity -- because humans are rational animals -- and therefore women and men are equal -- that is the argument."
"You are really free if you can escape ""Normative Conformity""."
"""Women are running patriarchy more than men.""
                              ~Acharya Prashant"
EK APAICH WALE EQUALITY 😂 EK NORMAL WALR KO DEDE FIR😂
Feminisms is a most planned idea plant wisely to spread narcissism.
Feminism is not matriarchy feminism is gender equality.
"नारीवाद मातृसत्ता नहीं है, नारीवाद लैंगिक समानता है।😮"
काश ये सॉरी बातें लोगों की समझ में आ पाती।😢
Idk wtf is this dude live under a rock most likely no one has problem with equality if they had it wasn't ever approved in the first place the problem is the modern feminist who changed what feminist meant when it was created by in the day. This guy think he's smart but the dumbest person on the internet who uses chat gpt to make his content and brainwash people
"dude you're 🤡. saying men and women are same and equal then later in the video proved himself how different we are. Men and women are really different from each other the behavior, emotions, strength, and mental strength.

Men and women isn't equal and never will be this stupid fight will go on forever until we accept this fact. If they want equality then why aren't they working in every single fields why only taking office jobs. These feminists only wants equality where it's benefiting them."
Jo galat karega use galat kaha jaeyga. Femenism ke nnaam par aaj ladies  bhi bahot saare galat kaam kar rhi hai. Tumne poore video mein sirf man ko galat kaha jo ki galat hai. Sirf ek side lena acchi baat nahin hain

"After I understood this, something came to mind...Who are we OR AM I to judge what woman should get rights...We both as MAN and WOMAN both naturally born with all the rights to have without asking for a permission. Than one would say, this is Feminism. But no we dont deserve to chose give rights to any body, we naturally born with it. So let's say a Man should think above Matriarchy...And women should....:) let's them decide. Than that's how I believe things will be naturally in normal to enjoy the beauty of life."
You can't play on both sides of the wicket. Feminism and Sympathy as and when needed.
"About male earning more than female i guess it is not exactly necessary. But us female at some point has to take a break from our career and go thru pregnancy, give birth, take care of that small child so there is a gap and now, there is another member added to a family who is very fragile and there will be a lot of hospital bills until a baby hits age of 3 or 4. It depends on individuals if they wanna go back after 1 year. But personally I would work too but my work wouldn't consume my whole time as it's crucial to be with a child during their mind and body developing phase. It's not exactly related to patriarchy, I'd say it is more about inflation and hospital bills and well being and protection of a small child that you gave birth too.

Also, I don't mind him earning less as long as we are quiet stable to pay for anything that is needed and don't have to run for a loan."
Bollywood ruin feminism
"I support feminism.
But my point is feminism is only used nowadays when it is convenience to them.
Whenever it doesn't go against they play the victim weak card.

"who says we cant relate ?? the rich girl slapped that boy which surely is wrong but how do she get to do so ? why she is misleaded by the concept of feminism whether she is wrong or feminist are not able to clear their ideas and even it is pointed out by alpha males why this thing still exist 
??"

"You're always fire in your videos 
Your videos and language of telling tham is amazing ❤❤"
femnism is mind cancer injected to female by male.
"You're mistaken, the feminism noble people supported is equal rights not equalty... 
Men never get treated same, they're treated what they deserve. That's equal rights.
Equality is asking for the same salery of your manager when you're just a peon..."
"""Women must be paid as much as men"". Yeah sure, when she's doing enough works a men doing. 
Equality doesn't apply everywhere. If everyone were equal then why sometimes it happens that a guy working for 4 years for a company doesn't get any promotion where a new guy gets it. That's where talent matters. Everyone cannot be the manager, it's not about men or women it's about their abilities.
World's fastest women could never beat Usain Bolt. It's natural, women aren't built as strong as men. 
I don't mean to say they aren't supposed to do that, they sure can. Everyone has the freedom, we've moved on from the past you're talking about. But you're wrong about being equal. Everyone must get what he deserves, not equal."
It's very rare to find people like you who understand every ideology so well♥️

"You talked about feminism wonderfully. I support real feminism but what about toxic feminism ? Nowadays feminism has come down from rights to clothes ? You can't deny it! I'm a Muslim woman living in a first world country doing a job and earning more than I need but women themselves look down on me, why ? Because I wear a HIJAB! How is a hijab a sign of patriarchy? Asian women European women condemn me mock me for wearing a hijab they say it is stopping me erasing me. But how ? I'm wearing it willingly I love wearing hijab I love practicing my religion I feel empowered covering myself but it doesn't mean I'm a helpless woman! I have a voice, my family prioritizes my opinion as much as my brother's or my husband even sometimes they ask me first then my male counterpart. I don't understand which feminism is telling me to remove my scarf and baggy clothes which I am comfortable with. I'm sick of that kind of feminism which starts with showing skin ends with showing skin."
"The title of this video is misleading, as it gives the impression that you're criticizing feminism itself."
"Men and Women are already equal. It is a no.1 misconception that Womens are equal to Men only when they copy Men in everything. A Women wearing Salwar Khamez and a Men wearing T-Shirt Jeans is already equal. It is the brainwash done to Womens that you are not equal unless you also wear same clothes like Men for this they demean Salwar Khamez and show like T-Shirt Jeans is superior. But it's a misconception. Wear whatever you want until you maintain morality. On similar terms if a Men does a job and earn Money it is equal to what Women do as being a homemaker (in fact this is more responsible job to do and i think it's more important) but society brainwashes you in such a way that job where you earn Money is superior. Remember it is Mother who bring up the child provide and teach him love, care and manners. How can you consider a materialistic thing like Money is superior to what Mother can provide. I understand practically you need Money which father earns but it's not superior to anything that a Mother can provide."
In my opinion feninism is good and all but to an EXTENT to a LIMIT
"You may be right about Patriarchal and Feminism thinking. But the problem lies in the demands in implementing feminism. They do not want equal rights but the more advantages for females and to remove disadvantages. Nothing is wrong in this but only when things are done keeping in mind both genders. 

When one advantage becomes disadvantage for other gender , it cannot be called feminism, but it is happening in the name of feminism.

1. Like reservation in colleges, govt jobs, even in private jobs. It is like earlier men have taken advantages in these places now let women do. Instead of equal rights and opportunity , they want to take upperhand.
2. Like equal pay for men and women cricket teams even though they don't generate same revenue. If this logic is applied everywhere then it will disrupt the society. For example , Instagram influencers, where a girl attracts many followers by showing only curves and eventually more revenue by ads etc but boy cannot. Shouldn't the 'equal pay' logic be applied here? 
3. Like laws made to prevent cruelty on women have now became a tool to exploit innocent men. If things were done keeping both genders in mind then this would not happen. 

I can tell you innumerous examples where they have demanded upper hand instead of equality and in most cases they have been granted.
It might have helped some of the poor, needy girls or women but the number is less and the biggest beneficiary are the girls who have decent financial background or above. They have all the resources and accesses as men do but they have been granted upper hands in many places and now they exploit men same like men used to do when they had upper hand in the society. 

In nut shell , innocent men and women are still suffering. The difference is that earlier evil minded men used to exploit and now both evil minded men and women exploit according to their comfort."
"Pagal saala,dunia aj iss mukam par aap ki youtube walon baaton se nahi khun,paseena,taqaat ladai,dominance se aya hai,apna jo word freedom ye kaise ate hai pehle ye sochna hoga.aurat mard ki tarah taqaat waar nahi hai.Tere nana aur dada se jaake puch yudh mein kitne mard jaan gawaye aur kitne aurat.Sala bewakoof hai tu."
"Bhai ap kay itna samjahnay kay bawajude mein ye baat 100 percent bol sakta hu is video mein viewers or anybody who watched sab ko sirf apnay faiday ki baat hi samajh ai ho gi or jaha tak jo feminism ki baat kartay ha wether gender is ki define pata karo yaha society mein female ko feminism ka sahi matlab nahi pata or is kay ilawa kahi kahi mein video say inagree karta hu because of a present view that is in front of me became too much common deny or avert your eye's.because if every one is smart nor a single of nerd existed then who is this world working there are two aspects loss or benefit , yes or no , good or bad I challenge every person alive prove me wrong."
I'm 18 right now and you don't even know how much things have you taught me. Not only in the field of education but how to live life happily and respect each other and all the necessary things. I recommend you highly for this generation.
The real reason people are not being feminist because in this generation people who have matriarchy mindset are spreading matriarchy named as feminist and in government too is matriarchy mindset as if a boy slaps a girl the boy in put behind the bars but if it the opposite there is no such rule for that 😮‍💨😮‍💨

"@dhruv rathi .. clearly drinking is not feminism for women, but jo movies aap criticise kar rahe ho, unme women are behaving as good as men do, agar aap lines draw karna band kar do.. to it will really feel like u can really digest women in all the areas."
"@dhruv rathi ji.. aap samjhe nahi, women is working so that kal chalke koi unhe chor de to wo self dependent rahe.. so they are overburdening themselves already when they have greater responsibility of giving birth to a child, with which they comprise on their health for life, if they expect a man earning higher than them, it is because ki ghar chalane ka bojh bhi admi unke sar na daal de .. i have seen many such examples in my day to day life, so ye expectation judge nahi ki jani chaiye."

You made a great video no doubt but you show only about women not about man... If you think today's generation girls are not misguided by their feminity then you are wrong in the end of the day a man feel peace with only his women.. But feminism gave them wrong.. Teaching.. So called Instagram and hollywood celebrity... They potray.. Feminism is about man vs women.. You need to watch their content then you should decide who is chapri..

"Bhai me apki sabki videos dekhta hoon but ish wali video me apkne aadhi sachai btayi hai aapne ye toh keh diya ki fake feminism wali filmo ko ya jo ladki ladke par atyachr krti h ospar kisi feminist ne support nhi kiya lekin oska virodh bhi ni kiya os level par jha agar situation reverse ho tab jaisa ye virodh dikhate hai.
Aur apne suna hoga galt karne wale se galt dekh kr andekha karne wala jyada gunhegar hota hai.
Toh jab se kabir singh,animal jaise movies ka itne bde level par virodh karte hai toh fake feminism wali movies ka waise virodh kyun ni karte 
Itna hi kafi nhi hota ki support nhi kiya toh ye sahi hai.
Admiyo k liye koi jyada strict law nhi hai koi organisation nhi hai jo thodi bhout hai onki sunni nhi jati.
Toh feminism ka matlab agar equall karna hai toh feminist logo ko galt cheej ka brabar virodh karna cahiye tabhi jyadatar ladke feminism ko support krengay 
Na ki fake masculinity par based movies ka jam kr virodh kro aur fake feminism par based movie ko bas upar upar se tal do"
u just compared nirmal femenists to mysoginists not like extreme femenists witg mysoginists or normal ppl who don't like femenism with normal ppl who do like femenism so yeah not a good comparsion to make

"The actual problem with the feminist movement is that a normal girl uneducated in this topic connects being rad and unapologetic with being a true feminist. Being disrespectful and not respecting any elder sounds consoling to their female ego.Being disrespectful is bad for anyone either a male of a female.Nowadaays in our society, its unfortunately a trend to be disrespectful and uncaring about men. When justifying this behaviour, girls say that it's their right to be disrespectful becoz somewhere in the past a man disrespected them, irrespective of the reason, so now they have the right to be rude and angry with men.This doesn't make sense. NO man I know goes out of their way to objectify women, they actually try to be extra respectful towards them.I'm not trying to justify what a male criminal has done in the past.But taking that few percentage and making it the normal for the whole male community has made the females in our day and age very intolerant.The criticizm these movies receive is not becoz they represent the true side of feminism,it's becoz they fill our female youths mind with ideas like cheating and vulgarity as being independent and right. It's really a disgrace tbh."

"Hello Mr Dhruv Rathee, I like your content as you standout for being an intellectual person with good researching skills. However, nobody is perfect. There is a movement in America known as MGTOW (Men go their own way) and they will tell you how much the modern society and law is going against men in many ways. Your views may have logic to it but your views are clearly from one side perspective as you mentioned the wrong women go through but you fail to acknowledge the hardship of men life by judging some online teenager chapris who haven't even stepped into real men life yet. I can personally give you many topics that should be discussed from a male's perspective and these are real life issues that have nothing to do with social media users or ""Alpha chapris"" like you mention. One example: Recently my American friend's parents got separated. Entire family and friends are bashing his father harshly calling him names without knowing the real issue. His kids are with the mother against his will excluding my friend who is over 18. Even for that the father gets blamed. His life is literally destroyed while the mother is happy. Many social experiments are done on double standards favoring women in society so dear Mr.. Dhruv Rathee you need to be open minded on struggles of both genders because both gender suffer in different ways."

"in simplicity a man a woman arent equal but they are equally valuable to this world, you cant expect a woman to lift 200 pounds as easily a man would, you cant expect a man to care for a child the same way a woman can, but ofc there is always exceptions, but in majority. woman and man arents the same but should be equally valued and everyone should have the right to express themselves as they please, if a woman wants to have her husbands name then good, if she doesn't then good, her choice. it goes both ways. respect both."
"The problem with modern feminism is that feminist blames everything on man rather then doing things, for example women always complain about not getting equal pay but study shows a women does 2× less work then a man does and modern feminism has beacome about hating on man and matriarchy, women already have all the right idk what theyre even fighting for they now have more rights then man, feminists complain about man and women being equal even tho we are not, like women got women's stuff and man got man's stuff its just how it has Been for thousands of years feminism is pure bullshit nowdays, if its a cultural thing that letting women down theres nothing we can do thats a culture of thousands of years but as a country we should have equal rights and women say we want to get treated equally as a man in jobs but they only want jobs of high profile jobs without having any skills thats the problem and a lot of them say's we Don't need man but theyre whole life is based on man theyre living in a home build by man sound crazy, modern feminism is bullshit and pure crap"
How can you make such a perfect video? ❤️🤌
i hate how if you have a different opinion on this you immediately turn into a chapri. You named highly educated woman from the past saying it's just a mind thing that she supports the idea of an patriarchal world without even considering maybe and the others who supports patriarchy has their own point of views.

"I am also a feminist and I am proud of myself. Every classmate of mine starts a debate with me saying that this goes against our religion as we are Muslims. They say things like, What are you talking about? You are gay? etc. But I still stand by what I think is right.
My class topper is my friend, and you won't believe that despite being the topper, he always debates with me on feminism. Well he belongs to the countryside and according to him, women should get an education but only so much that they can teach their children that's it. He says, What is the need for women to do jobs while men are made for jobs?""
Even toppers think this way. And the sad thing is my mom also sometimes tells me, ""What do you get by always debating about girls? Patriarchy has always been dominant and you can't make everyone believe in what you think.
I noticed that most men are against feminism; they support patriarchy. But when it comes to women instead of supporting each other as men do they often support patriarchy too. 😢"

"In no way women are equal to men. We are different. In 2024 budget, govt is spending 3 lakh crore exclusively for women development. IIT gives reservation, dowry is banned but alimony is legal. Overall men are paying taxes to believe women are equal. In reality only less than 20% women in India are working. Men are abused financially and forced to work abroad like middle east."
"Dhruv Rathee, you blew my mind. You truly are a gem. The way you view feminism and explain it in such a simple and accessible manner is remarkable. Your insights and analogies can serve as a valuable lesson for today's youth. The comparison and discrimination between men and women that you highlighted are everyday occurrences. Yet, I've never seen anyone explain these issues as concisely and accurately as you do. Even your real life examples support the idea that patriarchy is behind most of the violence around the world. Wow !!! Your ability to distill complex gender dynamics into clear, relatable examples makes the reality of gender inequality undeniable. Your explanations not only bring awareness to these pervasive issues but also provide a foundation for meaningful discussions and change."

"hello dhruv 
your video is just awesome , but i believe that a women never  be equal to man because i know women done pretty well things and creats history many times in past but at what ratio , I know you gonna answer me that society dont gives chances to girl , then answer me if womens is equal to mens then why they cant play a cricket match together or if mens and womens teams play together what will you think can womens team beats mens team"
Defined it in the perfect way👍🏻👏🏻
👍🏻
"I really appreciate this type of thinking , actually this is the real meaning of feminism . Every person , doesn't matter male or female, should watch this video. This really deserves an award. Even females should treat males equal, feminism is misunderstood with only females which is very wrong. This is a very good video to watch for the males who use the meme ""THE WOMEN""☕"

feminism gives you rights to choose without judgement which patriarchy doesn't ( both for men and women )
"There's no such thing as 'toxic femininity' or 'toxic masculinity'. Men and women are made as equals in the eyes of God (in terms of value), given their own areas of strengths and weaknesses, roles, and responsibilities. So, the traits of both sexes are considered divine and cannot inherently be toxic. Therefore, if a woman acts toxic, she is not feminine, and if a man acts toxic, he is not masculine.

(Though I may not be a perfect human, I try to live my life in accordance with my beliefs. My opinions may differ from yours, but that does not give me the right to condemn you, nor does it give you the right to condemn me.)"

"The 1st vdo I hate of Dhruv Rathi,"
"Did he say that a sensible guy would always be a feminist?? Trust me , that's the worst a man can become. Every man should be a good guy and every girl should be a good girl regardless. If guys can't differentiate between being a man or a psycopathic animal then thats not people's lookout, but his personal decision and he will have to pay for it. I am in no way supporting animal movie, i havent even watched a movie but dhruv is definitely not right about feminism...and guys like him should never be the role model of other guys who can't even understand the female nature. Dhruv wants to be liked so bad that its a joke at this point. Feminists are the worst of woman. And not even a woman should be feminist. Feminists are peole who wants to say politically correct things but they also demand equality on outcomes as well. Follow the videos of american youtubers as well if you know english guys. You'll learn a lot about the worst outcomes of feminism and how its the very reason of destruction of their societies. Dhruv rathee is definitely not a trustworthy guy just cuz he talks about ram and all these mythical gods.

"Proof by assertion. 
Either you are feminist or a fool. This statement is a fallacy."
The word has been hijacked and stop acting like it holds the same meaning it was meant to hold
I'm proud that I am a feminist. I'm proud that I am not matriarch nor patriarch.
"It's very important for women to have careers, specially if they want a family. Today it's impossible to raise a family in a single income household and unless you're upper middle class."
"May be we need to change name from feminism to equalism 

The name in its own sounds like pro women that almost always gets highlighted in case of toxic feminism"
"jab us cab drver ko thappad pade tab ye feminist uske support me kyun nahi utre? agar yahi cheez kisi ladki ke sath hota to sadko par andolan karne utar jate ye feminist...isi ko tum gender equality bol rahe ho...

jab laws ki baat aati hai tab tumlog equality ki baat kyun nahi karte...

jab gender based reservation ki baat aati hai tab tumlogon ki equality kahan chali jati hai..."
Feminism aacha soch hai lakin kuch ladki bohat independent feel karta hai. Jiski wajese bohat ganda dress penke socity mai ghomte hai jo ladko par bura aasar padta hai
your  contant  is always nice☺
there is no problem with feminism the real problem lies with pseudo/toxic feminism

Great job
Thanks for explaining feminism bro👍👍👍
"Bro you change my concept about feminism, may Allah bless u. I learned many interesting and informative things from your videos. In my opinion this channel is only for educators not for chapri's ."
The true problem is in how feminism is shown.. if i say honestly i didn't know feminism could have such a big impact on men.. i used to think this is a big problem but mainy for women.. but this video is actually very very informative.. these typical indian serials needs to be banned..and these type of videos should be shown in tv for better understanding of true feminism..
"IF THIS GUYS POLITICAL BELIEFS IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY INDIA WOULD BE A AMERICAS SLAVE LIKE SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN ALL WHOME ARE FUNDED BY AMERICA TO LOOK FUTURISTIC BUT EVERY ONE SUFFERS AND CAN'T EVEN THINK ON THEIR OWN AND CANT LIVE WITH OUT CONSTANTLY BEING SHUNED, BRAINWASHED, CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE OF POLICE,HARSH TREATMENT OF PEOPLE,HIGH TAXATION,EASY LIFE FOR WOMEN(who join a femanistic group and men too but a man has to defame himself as acting lower than any girl there bc if he criticizes them he is no longer in th club)AND IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIVE A ARTHASASTRIC/FREE/RELAXING/LIFE FOR MAN."
bdeshi nokkar (because he never says anything agents american left wing political beliefs. he wants left wing india so us can control india through gayism and femanism. which slowly helps women harass the common man so no man with an political ambition can climb the ladder or inshort femanism is a powerful tool to criticize who have power and shun them if they don't follow the political femanist belief because if they do they will be docile to them and if they don't they know that these type of people are their enemy)
"Thanks for changing my poor mind 
Religion does ... to you

No feminist supported that Lucknow girl? Yes some self proclaimed feminists showed their support to that Lucknow girl. That's the only factually incorrect statement found in this video.
Meko kuch v point legit nhi lgam... Equality alag topic hai aur comparison between gender alag ..... Mard aur aurat kv v equal ho hi nhi skte .... Kyunki ik mard ghar ka takat hota hai to ik aurat ghar ki emotions ... Dono ik point nhi hai but dono ik hi line k end hain ..... Ladki aur ladka totally different Kyunki dono ki parvarish alag hoti hai .
Agar feminism ka naam kuchh aur hota toh kya log zada support krte?
"Men shouldn't become women the same way Tires of a car shouldn't become steering wheel,they both are equally important but not the same , likewise your eyes are not your ears but they are important in thier way for a normal livelihood"
Thank you sir
For the information only ..both genders are not the same for every nature of work so both are not the same i only mention one thing here .. the only thing that in our body makes one to think differently and this is the proteinous substance called as hormone that makes this differences so in both genders there are many fold changes in hormones level in both male and female..so how both are same and equal..

No chapri was offended by this video. Cause they don't have the capacity to understand such content 🙏🏽
This is really an eye opening video. Really a great video
"reason for patriarchy is in olden days physical strength mattered the most for survivals and men being physically strong had the upper hand and females had to listen to men. physical strength meant that Men had the responsibility to protect their family, kids, provide food etc."

"Hey Dhruv , been following you for a long time . Just a suggestion,  what do you think of making a holistic video involing women's body , spirituality and women's nature ."
Did you forget the name of a feminism film?  name sooee dhaaga
❤❤❤❤
Neena gupta so dumb lol.
"Male and Female not just  have different organs but they also have different hormones level in their body. Their body cycle works completely different. I do understand about the equal rights on some points. But thinking like male and females are equal is complete bullshit. Look at the Nature does Female animal says that I will not take care of the offsprings and ask male to do all the things. No it doesn't. Its nature and that's how they are created. You have to accept it. 

I do agree that all females does not have equal rights and this is something which we can fix. But thinking men and women are equal and women can do all things that man can is totally bullshit. There are some exceptional and talented womes who can do it. But its not cup of everyone's tea. And encouraging women like this to fight for the unnecessary rights is again stupid thing."
Bhai my to kud berojgar hu 😂
What a great video!!!! Logic and explanation on point !
"Even after removing patriarchy 
Females will look for more than her - height,money,status 
Its truth we cant change it 
And its about *mostly of them not all of them*🙏🏻
Ive seen my friend staying at home most times and wife goes to work runs the house❤
But mostly femlae will look for a person better than her"
👍🏻🇵🇰
this society is totally brain washed
"Dhruv, sir 
I was in 9th or 10th stnd when I watched one of your videos through a whatsapp forward and I was super impressed with your intellect and kinda shocked to know that guys like you actually exist in real life. It's because I grew up in a tier 2 city and the environment here was patriarchal and sexist. Ngl I even took a ss of your photo to cheer me up whenever I lost hope in the entire male population. 
Now, at 21, after watching this video I'm so glad that humanity isn't dead afterall and there still are actual men like you who do not view women like how patriarchy views and treats them. 
I really hope this video reaches a large audience because I think feminism is the most mis-represented social movement of all times and therefore myths around it needs to be busted. 
Also, many congratulations to you (saw the news that you're having a baby) and all the best for everything... you're doing an excellent job in creating a social change and spreading awareness about many issues. Thank you so much. 

-A proud feminist"
Unbiased opinion....thank god this type of men also exist❤
Becuase women need different treatment while working late special cab service/security. Unconscious bias that if she can do it is ok bt if same level of boy can't he been scolded for not complete work. Current women are doing a soft easy job only. Are they equal. I agree they should have enough opportunity to work but they cannot be equal

"Stop Giving Fake information. Learn about ""Egalitarianism"". It is about equality. Feminism is about Female Supremacy and Misandry. Just because you say ""feminism about equality"", it doesn't make it about equality. Actions speaks louder than words."

"Only those Muslims getting married to hindu girls who don't follow the islam.  In islam hindu  girls and hindu  boys should accept Allah and his messenger Prophet Muhammad as a last messenger,  read  Quran and follow it ,  pray salah , do charity,  having fast for Allah not for any human ,Hajj privilege  and believe on life after deaths. 
If hindu girls accept these Islamic rules, then she is a Muslim and can get married to a Muslim boy , but  if she didn't accept islam ,so this marriage is illegal in islam.
No one is  following the  rules of religion. that's why  everyone is going worse ."

Anyone searching for hate comments? 😅
lot of important points missed . Agree equals rights very important but toxic feminism is when they demand equality in sports pay which is nonsense because men sports is at much higher level and   quality so more business hence more pay.  you talk as though toxic feminism doesn't exists

"Dear Dhruv Rathe,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to you because we are in desperate need of your help.

Recently, students at our universities (Specially Dhaka University, Chittagong University and Jahangir Nagar University) has been subjected to severe torture and harassment by government officials and student political league named ""CHHATRA LEAGUE"". 

This situation has created an atmosphere of fear and oppression, and many of us feel powerless to change it.

We're in an authoritarian regime.

We believe that your platform could bring much-needed attention to our plight. We need strong international media coverage.

It's not limited in ""quota protest"" anymore. It's much more than that. 

We may regain our freedom of speech.

Your influence and ability to reach millions could help expose these atrocities and potentially bring about change. We kindly ask if you could make a video or post about our situation to shed light on what is happening here.

It's 4:15 am. And I can't sleep thinking about my brothers and sisters of Jahangir Nagar University.

I myself also was attacked by the ""CHHATRA LEAGUE"" yesterday at 3pm when doing a peaceful protest.
Many was injured. I escaped somehow.

I love my country. I'm not feeling safe in my own homeland.

We would be incredibly grateful if you could use your platform to help us. Your support could make a significant difference in our fight for justice and safety. People of Bangladesh are fade up with this fascist government culture.

Thank you for considering our request. Please let us know if you need any further information or if there are other ways we can assist you in covering this issue.

Sincerely,

A Bangladeshi Student from University of Chittagong."

Here You are wrong mr Dhruv. Feminism causes more damage to Men and women these days
Why society doesn't normalize being a good person?

"I am watching you from Bangladesh.🇧🇩
And gradually i have become a huge fan of u.where i really dont  have that much people who i find to be admired. But u r a  true gem.
I am ashamed that in my country most of the man carries this kinda concept of patriarchy in the name of religion and culture.
They are so much opressing .
Literally its tough for any intellectuall woman to tolerate this things. And personally i have seen many woman suffering from phsycological issues. So in man but they are not willing to admit “YES WEARE BEING NEGATIVE  WE ARE SUFFERING “ cz they are happy with their toxicity.even they demean and insult legendary “BEGUM ROKEYA” and “MOTHER TERESA”…

we cant even deny to marry a non ethical , narrow minded man We are bounded to marry  or else we will become a characterless woman. Its just creating a huge pressure on our mind.
💔💔💔its really heartbreaking to see people of Indian subcontinent are suffering from this much ignorance .
Basically they are not willing to give human rights to a woman."
Make video for Bangladeshi students pls
So then why use the word 'feminism' at all? Why not simply call it 'men-women equality' or 'gender equality'?

"Currently men face two interviews in their life, first one for job and second one for marriage.

They have to show their digree cirtificates and other documents to show their qualities, job health, salary details, loans, investments etc etc...

Men just need, a good smile and good face😂"
For the first time i dnt agree with some of your point's
Absolutely lovedddd this video!! 👏👏Hats off
Respect for dhruve bhai📈📈📈
These conservative thoughts would hamper the gender equality. We can't disrespect a particular gender.
What about punishments? Equality in punitive laws and child custody. What about those?

you did properly give the meaning of feminism yep. thats true everything you said it true. but you didnt even mention the way feminism is going right now how feminism on west countries and rich feminists are showing the feminism. I support the cause but I dont support the way. 1900s feminism was way better than the one we're in right now atleast of west's.
"Because of the false information spread all over social media .....being a feminist has become a taboo ..specially amongst female bollywood celebrities ,in many of their interviews they're like we are not feminists but yes thats rightly said either you are a feminist or an idiot...we really need people like you with large following raising issues like this .....immense respect 🙂"
"Amazing... Amazing... Truly amazing 👏👏👏👏👏 

Finally I can say I am a feminist without hurting anyone's feelings or berating them.

I have never seen someone explaining stuff like you do. Never knew what was the literal meaning of these terms before. 

Keep making these phenomenal content. God bless you and your team. Lots of love from 🇵🇰"
"I think, feminists should also highlight the issues faced by men. The basic idea of feminism is that men and women, both should be given equality. But what ppl think it to be is giving advantage to women. I find this stereotype to be a major reason why ppl dont support feminism. By highlighting the issues faced by men, we can let ppl know the actual motive behind feminism."
Love ur videos ❤
What a line
12:58
I like this video util you mentioned Rushdie as legendary. You gotto look on otherside of a person before calling them legendary. I still believe your intentions are pure. Also I have nothing but good about feminism if people follow the definition.
first right video made by dhruv rathee

"The ""feminists"" we see on the internet are not actual feminists. There are many women who raised their opinions on the field and flight for thier rights despite the social alienation from the conservative society. They are the real feminists.
The pseudo feminists don't even know what they are fighting for. They just wanna be above men. If they succeed; a few years later, men will fight against the ""matriarchy""."
Right
Sorry lekin aj real feminsim khatam ho chuki hai or toxic feminism ho rahi hai feminism say kisi ko koi problem nahi society ko toxic feminism say problem hai or aj 90% feminism toxic ho chuki hai
Feminism is right Sir

"This guy clearly had an answer in the end but he just don't wanna see that, bro you need to understand if toxic masculinity has produce some idiot men than the same way toxic feminism has produced the idiot women who tend to do things in the name of feminism.  Feminism has some points that i don't agree with the same way i don't agree with the modern definition of masculinity. Everything should be in harmony and by the way nowadays feminism only supports gayism and this movement has lost its original moto so please stop reading psychiatric reports...they are not doctors they are just a group of idiots who likes to invent new names.... their role in our world is the same as chiropractors. They are both useless and making money on other people pain.
Please be human and make a human society."
Wake up to the reality my friend ..... nowadays feminism is just a failure 😂😂

"Retirement. On 30 June 2019 ,Zaira  Wasim announced she would cease her acting career as it conflicts with her religious beliefs and faith. In November 2020, Wasim requested fans to take down her pictures from social media as she was trying to start a new chapter in her life.
New Delhi: Young actress Zaira Wasim, who starred in the film 'Dangal', announced her retirement from acting in 2019. She said that Bollywood was getting in the way of her worship, which was her ultimate goal. She often shares her wisdom on spiritual matters on social media.May 29, 2023

"Great video. Thanks for this. You skipped a lot of great work done by women in the 1920s- 60s, not only by white upper class western feminist but also by Indian feminist. Hansa Mehta played an important role in shaping the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by changing the first line from ‘All men are born free and equal in dignity and rights’ to ‘ All human beings are born …’. There are so many such stellar women in our country in that period who have played important part in the long feminist movement. It is because of them  that today we have a better life today but still a long long way to go. Also just wanted to point out, when you were talking about anatomical differences, you said gender instead of sex. You should have touched upon the difference between these two. Gender is a social construct but maybe you could make another video on just this, which would be highly controversial with your audience if you go into the fluidity of gender. Educating your audience in small doses perhaps."

"we're different and equal according to The Quran, :Surah Al-Imran (3:195):  ""Whoever does righteous good deeds, male or female, and is a believer, We will surely give them a good life. And We will surely reward them according to the best of their deeds."" 

Surah An-Nisa (4:124): ""Whoever does righteousness, male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely let him live a good life, and We will surely give them their reward for the best of what they used to do.""  These verses emphasizes that both men and women are judged based on their actions and faith, not gender."
"In the WEST, FEMINISTS are PRO-TRANS AND ANTI-WOMEN."
Western Feminism are ANTI-WOMEN.
"@dhruvrathee Please watch the documentary ""The Red Pill"". It will give you a new insight into these topics. Also it is not just few organs, in general men and women are different in psychology as well. Have a look at Jordan Peterson videos."

"If this is feminism, then what is masculine? Please"
You have given a one dimensional approach to the issue. An average video with very less educational value. You have not adequately covered the huge spectrum between feminism and patriarchy. It is not all black and white or a zero-sum game. Poor

"You mentioned about neha and that rich girl incident, saying that no feminist supported them, but there was no feminist that raised thier voices against, isn't that hypocritical?"
Bro you are right but a female tried to kiss a male bollywood actor but no one talked about it much and the actor also taked it lightly now reverse the situation if this would happen to a actress there would be big court cases and also in my lil brother class he told me his teachers were females and they only used to punish boys not girls and says that all boys are very naughty and bad whereas girls are always right and good even if there is miatake of girl and also males are always wrong until not proven innocent. I also support feminism
dang i didnt realise  boys go through such bullshit where they cant even share their problem just because other person think they are weak
Be a feminist and oppose Female Reservations
just one question ... 1 amir ghar ki ladkine thaapad mara to feminism ne aavaj nai uthai ok right...but kisi men group ne bhi to kuch nai kiya .....aur na koi case banta hai...but yehi same chiz men ne ki hoti to case bhi bnata hai aur sare group wo ladki k support main khade ho jayege uska kya... why there is so much law difference when comes to men aur women waha bhi equality honi chaiye ...

"Toxic feminism is not equal to feminism. But Toxic feminism = Extreme patriarchy. Patriarchy and feminism are not bad for the society, one will teach discipline and one will teach love. However toxic feminists are cancerous to society and it is no less than another new face of extreme patriarchy.  There is a clear difference between women empowerment and SIMPing. If a 21year old woman in relationship with 15 year old boy and still 15 year old kid will be pointed if she files rape even though she attracts with pocso and all these because how regressive low level society India got. Read statistics about fake rape cases, using marriage to extort alimony, how dowry laws being used as a tool to extort money, men suicides, parental alienation. Last part of the video. Lucknow girl she harassed that guy. Is she now in jail or served jail time? I guess not. And you are mixing up feminist and toxic feminists both together when referring to that's totally wrong. People asked you to make a video on toxic feminists and talk about toxic feminism, how it's bad impact upon society and not about feminism."

"I need feminism because people still ask what the Victim was wearing. 

I need feminism because in most of the cartoons main characters are male which has an effect on a female children's mind that she can't be the main character in her life.

I need feminism because there are also so many places on earth where female zygotes are killed cause it's a female. 

I need feminism because a 12 year old girl gets SeXUALIZED with eyes and behaviors and then she gets blamed. 

I need feminism because  getting catcalled is still a thing. 

I need feminism because a man comes home for cooked food meanwhile a woman comes home from job to cook the food. 

I need feminism because they have problem when they see a girl being independent but not when a man being creepy. 

I need feminism because feminism is about gender equality. 

Feminism is not against men. 
Feminism is against misogynists and those people who are against women empowerment and gender equality."

"My personal opinion is you said many wrong things and many correct things first of all we all are accept common factors and difference between men and women it's not only body parts okay its hormone, characters etc.... its all are Nature evaluation it's not gonna be a change thats a common fact 😂 gender equality is a big joke of in the world (not about body part changes only) okay 👍"
I listen you very often but now especially in this video I finally realized that your thumbnail is far more different than your actual content .This is the same mindset that other cringe youtubers apply to attract the audience. But seriously I am very disappointed that you are starting this norm that how to attract audience. The title of this should as patriarchy type something

"First time not agreeing to this 
I have seen women actually use men

"Didn't expect this kind of ignorant opinion from you. Men and women are not same . Men and women have different roles to play in family and society.

Vaise to feminist ka ye topic apne uthaya hi nahi ki feminism matlab equality ke liye ladne wala to fir vo male  rights ke liye q nahi ladti and women privileges hi chalu hai aur fir vo bhi equality nahi hoti
"Women have more attractive physics than men , that's why  a man can go out  in the shorts and nobody will be attracted  and distracted by him,  nobody will see him eagerly.  Equally  means having  equal  good and authentic rights , regulations, and opportunities, not illegal right  eg : homosexual ,  transgender , short dresses , alcohol and physical relationship even ,  it's llegal by the government,   but it's not convenient and the result of it destroyed the society where our children are growing up. Illegal rights are taken by pressure on the government. 
In my religion, a woman can be chief justice ( judge) , but  can't apply for president  ( prime Minister)  but she can give  advice,  suggestions, and recommendations. If  she becomes a president then she will be  highlighted in front of  all the world and people only will notice her appearance , charm , youngest and voice . The president qualities are strong voice and strong physics to maintain a discipline and give strong warning to the world for protecting his country. 
 Women are not physically sronger than men,  that's why a man can do hard work for finances but a woman can do only slightly work. That's why men have to take responsibility for family members. 
Women considered as a old at  the age of 50 and she has menopause (   can't be pregnant)  but the actual timing is not confirmed by medical.  Some women have menstruation after age of 60 . Many films actresses got married after age of 45 and got pregnant after age of 55 . Actresses also fauj ( hiding real age) their age for 10 years because it's a showbiz careers requirement.  Women can be pregnant after perimenopause by hormonal treatment but men can not produce sperm after age of 60 even a man got married at the age of 50 and from 50 to 60 age he  is  able to produce sperm but his children will not be normal and healthy. Surely his children will be disabled ,  abnormal even can't be survived longer. Women ( plus 55 age) can birth normal and healthy babies but  babies from men ( plus 55 age ) can not be normal and healthy. Always women considered   younger than men at marriage time at least 10 , 18 years age difference  not same age. 
Mostly girls been forced to get  married at the age of 18. It's mean women have expiry date of age but men have no expiry date. 
Every man thinks that he can have many wives at same time but this rule  had been allowed only to the PROPHETS for supporting  the helpless women ,not  for every men. Nowadays  , you can support to the helpless women by charity. 
In Colombia , China ,  Croatia,  Austria,  Turkey,   Russia and Cuba , women are retired earlier than men.
18 years age of boy can lose his man 's  strength , power and  problems of  penis shrinkage and fracture  due to any causes  ,mostly  due to  bad activities and  it has no recovery  treatments  ,but women  can never have these problems even she involves in bad activities or not 
In my religion women can be alive by own without marriage. Just follow the religion. 
In many countries  women being forced to  get married to the animals and having diffenciation between girls and boys .Abortion with baby girl and having pills to change gender in the  ovary is common. 
A woman can learn,  work and  protect her self. 
In this world  bad men and women always exists between good men and women to destroy them. 0:01"

I'm not agree with you
I always watch your videos with a critical perspective but this one is too good. on point.
Being a women myself was hesitent to call myself a feminist even though in principle I agreed because of so much of the misinformation about it & The media presented miscontrued and  a wrapped version of it. However this helps. Thank you ❤
Bro toxic feminist ki to baate hi nahi kari tune
Salman Rushdie kanjar shaks h uski hate speech har aqalmand shaks k liey controversial banati hai
"The most important similarity between a man and a woman is that they both have brain, the organ responsible for intelligence, emotions, cognition, memory, learning, decision making, logic & reasoning etc etc,  so why should men and women be treated differently for matters related to the brain???? What is the logic behind it?? Anyone with a little bit of common sense will understand something as simple as this..... Its just that for years men have been brainwashed into believing that women are less intelligent than men..... So when they see a woman who is more intelligent and more capable than a man in any field of life men try to oppress that woman to save themselves from embarrassment.... But that doesn't hide the fact there always will be a group of women who will always be more intelligent, more capable,  have more sharpness and more potential  to be successful than men."
"Khud ko hi imagine kar liya ,😢😢😢"
GOOD MAN GOOD SARJI
"It's pretty straightforward, if a human wants to be something or wants to do something within the limits of permissible laws of the nation. He/She should be Independently able to do so...... But furthermore we need to understand, success doesn't have to be gender specific. Just because a man, good in his political/corporate/ any other career is considered as a Successful Man, A woman doesn't have to do the same just for the sake of portraying herself as a Successful Woman.

A woman/man should pursue what suits them best and be successful in that.

It has become very common now that women are trying to be successful as men. If they really wanna do something, it's fantastic. But just for the sake of proving it to the society that you can do the same thing that men can do, if you chase it you've clearly lost it.

A Woman or a Man are not entirely the same, nature has much more intelligence than we do. It made a difference between them to fulfill different purposes.

A woman on one hand has various abilities in which she is far superior to men, and the same goes for men as well.

Where is the question of equality here, it's like saying Apple wants to be equal to Orange, No god no, they are not and never can be and never should be, otherwise either you have 2 Apples or 2 Oranges. What about diversity then.....

Nature has made diverse, unique and different human beings. Nature didn't divide them, There has to be a coherence in them. 

If anyone tries to be superior or even equal to each other, they're doomed to fall sooner or later."
Actual gender is social concept and sex is related to biology. gender is conditioning to us by society like ladki hain raat min ghar m betho like that.

"I admired the way you portray the things/subjects.......everything is great.....But ..I always wonder...Have we ever consider who is our true lord/?..we never consider our existence in this universe. we all humans blindly follow our ancestors and forefathers and worship idols.....the stones, the rivers, fire, or humans who are just like us....we make a statue with stone and called it our God/Goddess.. or we start worshiping other people whoa are same  human as we...we are unaware of our duties in this world..........why do we exist in this world?.....we need to identify our own selves. b/c when we identify ourselves ..we will identity our true creator......religion or belief is someone's own choice but it's our duty to identify the true one worthy of worship.......b/c the lord gave us many signs to find ourselves and our purpose in life. To find the answer we have to dig the things......... may our lord/true creator guide us to the right path"
Our country needs more people like you who have this much clarity on feminism even I also didn't know this much
"i disagree with feminism regardless of its claims on equality. as I have noticed , it is more of man vs woman power struggle within societies. I have seen women take advantage of their freedom in western societies through family laws and property rights. They use the women rights and feminist ideologies to defend their unfair acts. I realise there can not be a society where men or women can have equal right. Reasons are:  for thousands of years most societies lived under male domination. And I agree that male took advantage of his dominance. Similarly if women were in charge of societies , They would do the same cruelty to men as men did to women. So in terms of morality men and women can be both ignorant , either of them can do injustice to each other if given opportunity. here is always competition between these 2 genders by nature somehow. Those who are married they can see this in their relationship. There is always power struggle between 2 genders. Therefore even set laws for equality , either gender will struggle to abuse those freedom and laws try to stay dominant in every matter. 
Based on their biological physical differences , it really matters in their capabilities. This is true, For example , My own elder sister was complaining that she is is unable to find job online in Australia. I was shocked. So I tried make her resume, and tried job hunting for her on my laptop. I saw most of the jobs were physically heavy work that a women can not handle them, and advertisements were asking for stronger men in order to avoid problem such as back injuries , safety issues. And there were very limited positions where jobs were available such as admin roles. Most were demanding a female for the role, some were flexible and asking for either gender. but the pay was less, not because they were asking for female but because the work was very easy. 
Say a man gets employed he would get the same pay rate as if they would employ a women. I realise that in most factories they demand for men because their physical capabilities, not because they were discriminating against women. I knew those job are not for my sister, she can not lift upto 20 kg being single or after marriage on pregnancy. Therefore the physical capability is natural fact that can not be denied. You can not compare a cat with fish and expect both to climb tree. but yes a cat has it own ability and fish has it is own importance to make this world perfect. it does not mean that one is superior upon another. This is the point where feminism has failed to understand and it is unnatural ideology."
"thank you Dhruv for changing my perspective. I didn't even know that I had that patriarchy mindset, you explained it with such a simplified manner and honestly, it was an eye opener."
"Both gender must respect eachother,  Rights should also be given to womens. But the difference exist between both genders. The nature had made some differences between both genders. There is a hell of difference between rights of male and female. If you say both should be consider equally so its not possible . Let me explain :

1) Cricket Team of male and female is different. Why in cricket team both genders are not included ? Why There is no match between Maleb and female teams?

2) why girls and boys have different hostels?

3) why seperate washroom are made for them?

4) why we cant see Male vs Female sports?

5) why Males are in large number in Army? 

6) why male and female doesnot have equal strength?

7) If all females do work in offices , hospitals, markets etc. Who will care about childrens.?? Who will Teach children's to be best.?

8) if we consider equal rights : there will be instability in a family even between husband and wife.

9) if we consider both are equal so there will no stability between them.

For example: If a boss in a company or else where pass an order . You have to obey it but if you think that i am equal to boss so you will be expelled. 

10) females moslty say that they are independent. My question is how? If a female does not live with her husband she think that she is independent. But think over the reality that she will do some sort of job? And ultimately she will be employed. Here in this case she is again not independent because she have to obey the orders of boss.


In conclusion, i do not think that females should not given rights ...but both genders have different rights and both should be given their own rights according to nature. 

I respect both genders. But we cant chnage the reality. Nature is Dominant❤"

Moron confess you are a simp..And What patriarchy? Atleast in 2024 indian women get more privilege than any other women in the world..Feminism is literally BS for sure in india.. Where they make laws that the wife can have marital affair as legal is stupid to the core.. I born as a human to enjoy my life not to understand opposite gender what they go through.. And sigma male? My god !! Empowered women is literally sigma.And stop differentiating good and bad into gender category... And don't underestimate women..

"Exactly...nowadays even me and my sister facing problems bcoz of some women's patriarchal thinking... So the incident was some people in my colony meeting where we live were misbehaving with my father on a specific topic, just bcoz majority of them were from same caste so they argue with my father in groupism. No one listening my father's opinion instead started trying to insult my father. So me and my elder sister started speaking in support of my father. So everyone was telling us that "" u r girls, n girls should not speak in public. U girls r shameless, ur upbringing is wrong, our daughters n even daughter-in-laws don't speak in front of others"" and most of words like this came from women. Why we should not talk? why we should not take stand for our parents? Just bcoz we r girls.. this is really sad n wrong"

"I am sorry, I disagree with this point. In my college days I was very rational and used to be  an extreme feminist, but after watching the women closely I came to know that they are very selfish and egocentric. Two of the girls whom I loved with all my heart and soul, specially to the second one, cheated on me very badly, that too for no reason, by no reason, I mean, I didn't give them any reason to cheat on me whether financial or anything else like that, but they cheated on me, apologized to me, I forgave them. they again cheated on me,  again apologized to me, I again forget them. they again cheated on me,   ..  this is what women are"

Bro just made me a feminists
It's always the jobless men who mock women these days and we don't take them seriously 🙂
"My views is,  if a man are not strong, families and societies become weak. But in opportunities and talent both have equal rights. Good Man are made to protect families, country boundaries, whereas household responsibilities are by good women. Bad human beings can be both. If a man rap women or if a girl rap man, or put a false rap cases, bad are these both. But somehow, i observe most present societies, women are in much cares and love than the man like evn in a false rap cases, man are torture and blame in the name of protection, but for man rights none stand up except Mother, evn if a man are right in the street still bt girls can slap or put any cases without evidence n man will be punish, if not comes with strong evidence. Both should be given equal rights. Think if most politicians, police, armies fighting in boundaries, freedom fighters, are women, apart from other professionals work, what will be the society condition. I feel i am made to protect and provide necessities, and to bring protection in my house, if future wife is good, and to my country. God had gievn own strength and talent to both if they are both equal in everything than in society, why rich Girl don't get married  with poor boys and provide securities to families, to which good and responsible man do. Both girls and boys should be uplift and encourage, bt to some certain levels. I take man who really rap woman, or destroyed others are not man bt a mad man of devil."

"اسلام میں معاشرتی ڈھانچہ اور قوانین قرآن و سنت پر مبنی ہیں۔ اس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ اسلام کی معاشرتی اصول اور قواعد جدید نظریات جیسے فیمینزم، پیتریارکی، یا میتریارکی سے مکمل مطابقت نہیں رکھتے۔ آئیے ان تینوں نظریات کو اسلام کے تناظر میں دیکھتے ہیں اور سمجھتے ہیں کہ کونسا نظریہ اسلام کے ساتھ زیادہ مطابقت رکھتا ہے:

### 1. **فیمینزم (Feminism):**
فیمینزم کی تحریک خواتین کے حقوق، مساوات اور معاشرتی انصاف کے حصول کے لئے جدوجہد کرتی ہے۔ تاہم، بعض فیمینزم نظریات مرد و عورت کے کردار اور ذمہ داریوں میں کسی قسم کی تفریق کو قبول نہیں کرتے۔

- **اسلامی نقطہ نظر:** اسلام مرد اور عورت کو روحانی اور اخلاقی لحاظ سے برابر مانتا ہے۔ قرآن میں فرمایا گیا: 
  ""اور عورتوں کے لئے وہی حق ہے جو دستور کے مطابق مردوں کے لئے ہیں"" (البقرہ 2:228)۔
  لیکن اسلام میں مرد و عورت کے مختلف مگر تکمیلی کردار ہیں جو خاندان اور معاشرتی نظام کی بنیاد ہیں۔

### 2. **پیتریارکی (Patriarchy):**
پیتریارکی کا نظام مردانہ تسلط پر مبنی ہوتا ہے جہاں مرد غالب ہوتے ہیں اور خواتین کے حقوق محدود ہوتے ہیں۔

- **اسلامی نقطہ نظر:** اسلام میں مرد خاندان کے محافظ اور کفیل ہیں: ""مرد عورتوں کے حاکم ہیں اس وجہ سے کہ اللہ نے ایک کو دوسرے پر فضیلت دی اور اس وجہ سے کہ وہ اپنے مال خرچ کرتے ہیں"" (النساء 4:34)۔
  لیکن اسلام میں یہ ذمہ داری احترام اور محبت پر مبنی ہوتی ہے اور خواتین کے حقوق کا تحفظ کیا جاتا ہے۔

### 3. **میتریارکی (Matriarchy):**
میتریارکی کا نظام خواتین کے تسلط پر مبنی ہوتا ہے جہاں عورتیں غالب ہوتی ہیں۔

- **اسلامی نقطہ نظر:** اسلام اس نظریے کی حمایت نہیں کرتا کہ صرف خواتین کو ہی اختیار دیا جائے۔ بلکہ، اسلام میں مرد و عورت دونوں کے کردار و ذمہ داریاں ہیں جو معاشرتی توازن قائم کرتی ہیں۔

### کونسا نظریہ اسلام کے مطابق ہے؟

اسلام کا نظریہ ان تینوں سے مختلف ہے کیونکہ:
- **برابری اور انصاف:** اسلام مرد و عورت دونوں کو برابر روحانی اور اخلاقی مقام دیتا ہے اور دونوں کے حقوق و فرائض مقرر کرتا ہے۔
- **تکمیلی کردار:** اسلام میں مرد و عورت کے مختلف مگر تکمیلی کردار ہیں جو معاشرتی توازن قائم کرتے ہیں۔
- **معاشرتی انصاف:** اسلام ہر طرح کی ظلم و زیادتی کی مخالفت کرتا ہے اور مرد و عورت دونوں کے حقوق کی حفاظت کرتا ہے۔

لہذا، اسلام کا نظریہ ان تینوں سے مختلف ہے اور اس کا توازن اور انصاف پر مبنی نظام معاشرتی بہتری کے لئے مناسب ہے۔"

This video is the best one i have seen on feminism. Such simple and extravagant words ❤
"Hey, it was a really interesting topic you chose with some great examples. However, I would like to point out that do you remember you asked your wife in one of ur wedding vlogs that she has to agree on the term that she cannot even go to her fathers house without your permission. Do you think if that’s patriarchy or feminism? Can you justify?"
"For your kind information,non feminist men also give permission from their will to earn or do job to their wife.its not about equality or similarity its about mutual understanding and love amd care for each other and for their childs future
Actually your definition doesn’t have exact meanings"
"Dhruv bhai islam me patriarchy jaisy koi cheez nai he. Hamare prophet Muhammad(SAWW) ne to khud ek maaldaar khatoon(Umm_ul_momineen Hazrat Khadija)se shadi ki thi jo un se umer me bhi kafi bari thi
Lekin Allah ne mardon or aurton ke liye alehda alehda duties rakhi hein, jisme mard ke liye bivi bachon ko khilane ki zimmadari he aur aurat ke apne bachon ki dekhbhaal he
Magar agar koi aurat parde me reh kar kamati he to is me us per koi gunah nai"
You are superb..Dhruv!! Carry on. Very nicely interpreted the terms.

"When I was in school there was a teacher who always said that women's are more superior then men ,then one day I asked my teacher that why is girls are more superior then men because those two are equal then my teacher couldn't even said a word. I hate why people do that because at the end we should know we all are humans and i have seen another problem about transgenders I don't know why people don't like them thats a very bad thing and another very bad thing is that those transgenders in India beggs why are they taking advantage of being an transgender if I was begging saying that I'm a man would people give me respect."

Some women uses or weponise Feminism to attack on males who just do their job and exist. There is a area in feminism to that exist to oppress or suppress innocent male rights.
"My boyfriend is on the line between this discussion. He respects me,his mom and every woman he comes across, supports me and his mom in working (literally makes future plans on the basis that I'll be earning more than him) and he's happy. But GOD FORBIDS its about him. He is so so so helplessly patriachal, I can't cry , I can't show u my weakness, whatever is hurting me will go away I should not express it I'm a man. Im trying my best to help him.I want him to support himself just as much he supports me. Let's see if my psychology honours will help me."
Go back to your country. And criticise them
It's incredibly enlightening.
"I am all for equality, across all borders, including gender. As for wages, it should be based on outcomes. However, equality cannot transcend the biological differences between men and women. Its simply unreasonable, in other words it going against nature.  You cannot expect a fish to grow feathers and fly, and expect a bird to procreate by laying billions of eggs. Law of nature brings order, and going against it will only create chaos."
Ye kya bolri ho rinki ki amma😅
Good one. But how broad minded r ppl in india? After marriage why should only a girl leave her house and her parents where she was born nd brought up and go to totally new unknown family and adjust for everything? Why should only girls change their surname after their marriage? If it is a inter- religious marriage why should all the rivaz be done as per the guys religion nd why should the girl follow only husband's religion and convert into that? Why do children get only fathers surname? Fathers religion? Why not mothers infact mother is the one who gave birth to them? I am proud to be born as a girl but regret to be born as a girl in INDIA

"Mr. Rathee explain it very well that we want equal rights not to overpower men and i think people should share this video instead of those toxic memes which promotes patriarchy 
Not all the men are bad not all of them want to objectify us some of them are with us and there still a hope that men still are human like us they want good for us and toxic people always criticise men who cry like why not they are humans they have problems like everybody else they also have feelings why not and i respect every men here who is like him who promotes thoughts like him
‘We always respect men like you, you all are real batman brothers’❤️"
Its all about Good human being
"A woman cannot be equal. It is not a matter of fact that a man wants to take women out of their homes and get them out of work
 Then the house also wants to put its responsibility on women. The slogan is blond that it is women's rights and all the arguments that are given were given. Now is a woman who has to have a child, then there is no such thing as an example of this child. It is not possible to get home
May this child be promoted. He also does housework while the man only works. It is natural. The man is strong. He is also responsible. However, many things are in it. It is his right to get education. He does not have to be equal to the man and the example of the difference between the intelligent and arrogant people of men. This example is so weak
 Which fool has said is the same status of a wise man's opinion which is a fool's opinion from today, not in Greece, Socrates died because of this ideology, but the thing is, it is difficult to admit the truth"

Lets talk about alimony 😂 law is too much women centered
"Women can never be the same as men. And their rights can not be the same! In some cases, women get more facilities than men which a man never gets. Giving equal rights is a very bad choice not for the men but for the women. Thats why some women never support this equal rights' illusion."
"You are on the right path.
But the real feminism is that no women should feel گٹھن
She has the right to inheritance, food and clothing. In all probabilities men are stronger than women physically.
Anyhow it is a long debatable topic.
Very well done any way"
Your research is incomplete. Make research on feminism in real Islam.

I believe in Patriarchy till it says Boys don't cry !! But My Dear Brothers and Sisters Toxic or Fake Feminism isn't good !! If a women can't cook or a women don't wanna give birth It is real that she is running from her responsibilities !!
My father was a feminist
Thank you for informing me
I imagined myself when u said imagine a jobless person 🙂🤥
12:33 Women and men are made differently . Its shameful that I hear such remarks from an intelligent person like you.
"12:25 Hypergamy is naturally in women. Don't try to change the nature of women because if you do , they will break."
"Feminist societies don't necessarily solve the isolation problems of men but could aggravate them as feminism is slowly taken over by radical feminism. Notice America or some of the European cultures as examples, highly feminist cultures today.  Studies show many men there are more isolated, lack touch, emotionally repressed and have more depression issues than a country like India which is wrong in being patriarchal but has more male solidarity and friendships than those nations. I cannot totally agree with this idea that feminist societies also become more pro manly. Empirical evidence of western nations seems to show that the system in west is not becoming gender equal but more highly gynocentric for various reasons and seems to be ignoring men's issues. I maybe not totally right about this, but studies do show western men having more toxic issues than Asian men.
I am not saying this as I am anti west or a nationalist Indian, but simply based on actual studies of feminist west. I am not also alpha male.  I would be happy to be proved wrong."
"12:44 nahi vai, yea bohoti galat soch hay. agar wo admi tumhe nahi janta aur tumhe for no reason gali de de, tab offence mat lena. Lekin jab to tumhara gadi me scratch kar dia to tab to offence lena padega na! tab to usse paisa usul karna padega na.
lekin aisa trick apne jan pahachan ke logoke samne mat karna. log tumhe lallu samjhenga (personal experience) aur log tumhe for no reason aur v zada gali denge, eventually wo bulling me convert ho jayega. kyu ki tum huch nahi karte.


buddha ne kaha tha ki unke baat ko man ne ke pahale analysis karne ko, agar thik na lage to reject karne ko. yea raha mera analysis."
"I am a literature student and this topic is very much familiar to me, but honestly there was still some loopholes to understand this concept. but i think now i can perfectly understand what 'Feminism' really is about. Thanks to Dhruv"
very good

"But mens are mentally, physically and emotionally  stronger then women, mens should take care of women ,he should provide financial support and and should take all resposibilities becuase by nature god has given men  ability to do it, but womens cant do what men does but both are superior in one or the other thing so we should not compare"
👍👍

Women and men should work together to bring out best! why demean each other
People in our country should really watch and appreciate this video..Very Nice

Only women can be feminists.. If you believe Christians can pray to their god you don't become Christian. Feminism is what women want for themselves.
Islam ko saare darmo se compare me ek video bnae please
1000 % correct ❤
your all statement are right. but as a father if my daughter wants to become a slut should i let her choose or try to stop her?
Facts: Women like Nora fatehi aren't harmed in this video!
Very very true. Specially unemployed men mindset
♥️
you are so good to explain things...
Lekin toxic feminism ka kia?
"Prophet (SAW) said: ""Fear Allah regarding women. Verily you have married them with the trust of Allah, and made their bodies lawful with the word of Allah. You have got (rights) over them, and they have got (rights) over you in respect of their food and clothing according to your means."""

"Sir, the problem with modern day feminists is that they don't want to abolish the patriarchy, they want to make a matriarchy, like a large proportion of them start campaigns on roads with slogans like kill all men, or men are trash, or a woman will always be superior to a man and stuff like that. Plus many of these modern day feminists, mostly use the social media as a weapon, by making fake videos on men, who don't even talk to them or have just glanced at them and start calling them names like creeps, or these a guys are future rapists and stuff like that, my point being the so called feminists of the modern generation, don't want equal rights all they want is superiority. Please give your opinions on this"
"dhruv Rathee, please Make a Video on "" Income inequality of India is worth than British raj "". Make people aware about Spiritual Revolution becoz you have enormous reach with you now. Make people aware please before it's too late..🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
Today first time i disagree with the selective current you have put

Very good movie"
Boys......... Thanks 😂😂😂

The WORD feminist isn't wrong ( but girls are using FEMINIST and INDEPENDENT WOMEN type of words in the wrong things they are doing )
Hats off..thank u for such words and explanation...u r really working for the nation and the so called samaj .❤
Gurudev
Nice Bro. Thanks 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 I am Feminism
Wow .........bahut khoob .
"The real problem i find in what is known as ""modern feminism"" is that women thinking that they don't need men. Infact we need both of them and we need each other in every aspects of our life. The idea that spreading now that women can be equal to men is totally wrong in my view. Women and men are different, both in anatomy and also in several other aspects. But just like dhruv rathee bro said, it doesn't mean they don't need equal rights. We are similar, which is enough to have equal rights. But the problem still lies on many people's mind and I've seen many videos of people saying that 'we don't need men/ we don't need women', then saying that this is feminism. The real feminism is not only about women, but about both men and women."
"Excellent. 
I never underestimate the power of women"
"Vidya balan's movie ""Natkhat"" is an excellent work against Patriachy."
Women should be aware first n should teach their son to be a person who believes in equality.
"There are some  more reasons for this...A very strong conditioning. Many provileged blind spots.
EGO etc. 

 Though its slow but change is happening and will happen and now as people are more aware, it will happen faster. Keep sharing and making your mark visible through such wonderful videos  You are a changemaker. God bless."
Dhruv Rathi Pata Hai Teri Man kis kis ke pass Jaati Hai Tu Kiska Hai Kiska Nahin mix hai
Can you make videos on relationships and psychology?
"Feminism is pointless nd senseless thing in this gen.....women's has equal rights now, brainless ppl talking about senseless topic.
By the way if u hv a daughter don't let her to be equal vth men. men and women r different in many things don't linkup vth the opportunities."

"I never watch any chapri youtuber videos. But as a feminist i always knew, you were some decent guy. No wonder why julie married you, she is really lucky ✨"

Thanks you Rathee bhai
"Respect women, that's a good sign of a man. However, there are women too who don't deserve respect at all so those don't deserve it. In this sh*t gen, both men and women are becoming toxic day by day. So, respect men and women, both who deserves it. Don't be a feminist who start supporting what girls do which is influencing people in a very wrong way. That's not called feminism, that's simping."
Patriarchy is based on the silence of women .
"I am not a feminist. Yes I believe in girls equity right but not in equal rights.

Then women should be in farm lands cement factories industry and other mega factories .. Equal rights   simliar species  Actually feminism is good but the problem is ...it is being mostly used in only employment and political oppurtunities
"Far spectrum of any ideology is dangerous whether it is Feminism or Patriarchy. 
In my opinion, Gender Equality is impossible to achieve as long as women are hypergamous. Today, Women enjoys even more legal right than men in most countries. But still, THey are falling behind.

Men believes more in action to improve situation than expressing emotions. Women give more suicide threats than men but men commit suicide more. By nature, Men are more action oriented."
Your information act as tonic for mind.. Eye opener.. Lot of things to work upon.. Start with me from today after watching it.. I m feminists still lot of things more to implement..
"Maturity is when you realize that women and men aren’t created to be equal but have their own advantage and disadvantage. And trying to make them both equal will create unequality for a significant amount men such as higher divorce rate, getting life partner will become very hard for lower income men, marriage will become harder, families will get broken more, lower birth rate, more depression among women and loneliness among men and harder time for a man to get employed cause women have already captured lots of jobs. And men will be expected to make more money as majority women wants a man who earns more than her and unemployed men will be invisible in society and hard time getting job and they will not have families cause they are unemployed but on the other hand unemployed women will easily find life partner. Men will be afraid of marriage because of law and family system will be totally broken with lots of single mom and unmarried old women. Feminism only favors capitalism and industry owners and governments as they get cheap labour but the normal people suffer without even realizing the problem and women get deluded by thinking feminism will make them happy and successful and instead of cooking for their husband and raising children they work in office and earn money then come home and cook for themself and for their husband and children if married. But now they are more independent and salary is lower cause more people in work field and higher inflation hence more people are working more and earnibg less while the people in top are making more."

💔😞😞In the era of technology we will talk about this topic it is shameful for the country and the world 🌍
"In our society, there are many pseudo feminists, who wishes of Matriarchy. The problem with feminism is that other feminists who back for equal rights of men and women, doesn't stand against those matriarchal women. Feminists would easily attack patriarchy which is needed, but never does address the evils of matriarchal women. These matriarchal women remains under the shadow of feminism, and accuse guys of being misogynist, when they themselves are misandrists. These misandrists have the idea that men after exploiting women for generations do not have the right to stand for the women, be feminists themselves, as men cannot understand the issues of women, that women are doomed by God itself, when God chose to be patriarchal and had hence sent women as baby bearers. General people doesn't have a proper understanding of what feminism is, and that's a big failure of Feminism as per now, the failure included in the the arrogance and hatred of patriarchal men, that THERE IS NO TOXIC FEMINISM, BUT MATRIARCHAL TENDENCIES WHERE WOMEN BEING MISANDRISTS CHOOSE TO EXPLOIT THE PERKS OF FEMINISM LIKE HOW FOR AGES MEN HAD EXPLOITED WOMEN UNDER PATRIARCHY. 

Happy Equal Rights. Pat Pat exploited women and men in these evil society."

"Prophet Muhammad  (peace be upon him) was Patriarchal person. Feminism is totally a different meaning mean, equal right. Your and the society description of feminism is totally wrong. Equal right means same right of consumption of every thing excluding few. For example few works are totally for men and few are women. Just like leadership, few jobs. women harassments are increase for your so much calling feminism. The first woman leadership was introduce in roman empire in the life time of Prophet Muhammad  (peace be upon him). His words are like this ""A nation in a woman can't prosper."" God sent all the prophet as his leader as men not in women. Can you explain it why?
Answer it, if you can do so. Your are a cancer in this video Dhruv Rathee for the social media."
"It never possible to give equal pay
Male employee mistake karde to boss sir pe chaddd ke galiya deta hai

And if female employee made mistake boss be like i am very angry this is last time i am tolerating it

Gaali sunne ka samaj ka boj sehne ka bonus hai ye sab

Kyuki acche kaam ke liye 
Male employee get only congratulations from family even not from boss

But female got cake in office and each employee congratulate

Men and women can never be equal kyuki positve effect to mill jayege females ko equal pay , rights bla bla

But kabhi koi boss female ko gali nahi de payega koi teacher 3rd degree nahi de payega koi female se uss lehje me baat nahi kar payega jese wo male se kar pata hai

Wese bhi ladkiyo ki popularity males se jyada hoti hai har jagha so girls enjoy popularity males enjoy responsiblities of big projects and high paying jobs

(Yaha mene kahi nahi kaha ladkiyo me dimaag nahi hai responsibilities uthane ke liya ya high paying jobs ke liye)"
Thank you Bro ❤
It is disrespectful to see you talking about feminism in public
A feminist wants power of a man respect of a woman and responsibility of non✌️
Feminism Women are a problem for human Existence...
"you are a cuck dhruv rathee in 21st century women have become GODS they control the whole narrative they have 100 different laws by their side meanwhile men are just like fishes in a rapidly evaporating monsoon pond mere a r@pe allegation is enough to ruin a man's life completely it does not matter if it's made up or not. During marriage, a woman can easily fu$k off with half of her husband's net worth without an issue with just a little piece of paper. There are NO laws to defend men against such acts. If a man cheats? Boom, she gets everything. If a woman cheats well, she gets everything here TOO! Now, some people will think I'm a women hater or think that all the problems stem from giving women rights. Both are false. The real problem is movement from conservativism or traditionalism towards a hollow meaningless world made up of fake promises for what?! MOrDeNiSm????? I could probably go on for another hour or 4, but I'm too drunk rn when you connect the dots it all comes together when it starts making sense there's no going back it's a huge psyop set up by the elites."
We want humanism not just feminism
I cant believe a man is saying this!!!!!!!!!!!  You earned my respect.

Dhruv Bhai jo log aise event ko feminism keh kar badnam Karte ha reality ma wo app jitna padhe likhe nahi hote 😂😂😂😂😂unke like ye bas ek news ha masala mar kar😂

"Men were used to be brave back then, but now most men are weak, so that patriarchy affects men in negative way. Men dont cry coz they were brave. Now everybody is tryin to normalize men to cry and be weak and to emasculate men. Instead complaining about that, improve yourself, dont cry, get strong, brothers."
Thank you so much for making this vedio it really opened my mind towards our society especially indian film industry.
Very true....😊 All people should watch this vedio.

"lets teach all these FEMINISTS a lesson. MEN SHOULD START BOYCOTTING WOMEN, STOP APPROACHING THEM AND MINGLE WITH THEM, DONT GO ON DATES WITH THEM AND DONT EVEN SHOW THEM A SINGLE SIGN OF AFFECTION...WHEN THEY BECOME FURSTRATED, THEY WILL FIGHT EVEN MORE....BUT STILL IGNORE THEM"
"Damn he is just above and beyond
Huge respect for this man
Hats off to youuuu🛐"
I think its time to change dictionary from feminist to equalist which removes this confusion from world.
"What about the equality in Indian law which always supports women even if they murder and give some fake self defense statements they won’t be punished…how will you define this?
Cruel feminism?"
Wow❤
"Wasting of time. 💔

If I appreciate your idea and than man and woman both will try to get job opportunity.  What will happen to the childs they have?

They will grow up with the idology of a house worker not with their parents idology.  

There are several opinions like this.  So I think that the old rule is correct. Everything was right. For example see the Westerns who implemented feminism in their culture.  Now it will be harder to find a virgin girl/boy there before marriage."
"It is also your great privilege that you are living in great times ,where India is full of chapris(wannabes) and monetizing on borrowed thoughts, and I am a centrist, nor a bhakt nor a pseudo liberal. Pls sometimes be unbiased and sell your opinions with your founded opinions"

"12:30 also men won't marry a girl if she isn't ""Pretty"" that's patriarchy"
"In our society  ""Aurat hi aurat ki dushman hoti hai ""."
Loved the coverage and presentation as usual
"ok so i have a slightly diffrent opinion as a male myslef i think its our responsibility to provide and protect our family see this is a universal truth that a most of 18yo boys are stronger than a 30yo women so i think if there is a fight to happen the boy should protect his sister mother etc or women idk whoever she is or a stranger then the next thing is that in the hirarchy of society womens should get the right to vote but there is a diffrence in the opinion of giving them strong positions they shouldnt be given any strong position like a militry general unitll or unless they are exceptional becuase this is a genral fact that men are more strong emotionally as compared to women so the deicision making power of men is more harsh and stronger than a women under immense pressure its jst not simple not possibel and we all know that for sure whenever u go back in history and look at the great wars they were fought by men and that is the primal rule men are supirior in physical and emotional capability i dont think there is a women out there strong enough to be a military general fighting against the mongoles and tatar around 1000ce who decapitate u and hang ur skull on their waists as a reminder of that they killed u or eating raw flesh and heart of animals and drinking blood or jst slicing the bellies of pregnant womens and killing their child alongside them and hanging their skulls side by side or decapitating every men in the city in a line after counquring the city  womens are simpley not built for such gore and violence women cant possibaly lead an army under such circumstances and more over they are weak physically where ever u go go on the internet and search most of the physical records are made by men and womens tend to weaken under such circumstances aaah u can say some exceptional cases like their are some weak men and strong womens but see the majority so leader hip should be directly under men that is my opinion ofc u can have ur own but i stated my arguments now the third thing is that i think womens should be given equal rights in every field of works in pay checks in protection in medical i think more than men cuz they need it more if there is a single mother working 9 to 5 for her 4 childrens its difficult for her mentally and physically and i think they shuold be given more bonuses and more pay checks if a men is being paid 500$ for that job the women should be pain 700$ that is becuzse the nature as made diversity but diversity sure creates inequality not in the norms that sure is created by the society but in physical and mental circumstances and i am not agsint womens going in military they can go as doctors they can go as teachers they can go in other profetions like the one in controle room etc but in war u should send men it isnt wise to send womens in war aaah yess u need to have womens for arresting womens and etc in police they should be there ofc a male shoulndt like arrest a women ofc they are mroe harsh and u know more strict womens should deal with that so see there are many factors see nature created men and women two seperate genders now the thing is nature created diversity but also inequality in abilites see men cant reproduce but sure are strong and womens can reproduce but are weak so the thing is that resources should be distributed over need not norms but i think that should be also undercontrole as per laws obvioulsy there will be very much exploitation wich is inevitable so there should be laws and they should be imposed and followed so but the point is i do think womens should be given more as men are supirior i don say in a racial and creational way like racist people say white poeple are supirior then black but in a way like men are suprior as per the creation the nature has given them more physical and mental strenght and that is the truth men have been providing hunting and creating socities and increasing their political influences ctreating wars for thousand of years till now and women have been doing household work for thousands of years and that is the general rule of thumb but as the society advances i think the normas shuold mature and should change a little bit as the faminits normally potray masculinity as a dangrous thing but it is the polar opposite genuine and true masculinity is ouit there to protect to provide next thing is that womens should be given any job they want pilots engineer doctor but i here i do think there should be optimal rules for hijab and letting women cover themselves cuz this is the basic thing and even scientific studies provide evidence3s that men tend to be more visuallly please as compared to women there has beeen several studies that 50% or more of men at work watch porn or masterbuate and do other secuall activites and many places are involved in such office cultures there has been more studies on office affairs and u can yourself see air hostesses only womens who suffice some specific beauty norms in many airlines are taken in as air hostesses the question is why because society objectifies women bucuase they want their men audience pessanger to be more pleaseed see this is truh and no one can deny that so jobs like that i dont think are safe and hounerrable and i also don entirely oppose the idea of womens being piloets or being airhostesses they can be but in womens portion so some changes thousld be made and for gods sake understand that the society says the less clothes u have the more revealed u are the more educated and liberall and opne minded u are but that isnt the case the thing is all of them want to see u in tight and rvealing clothes why should we not do hijab its safe aaaah u can argue but i do have more arguments then this and many more so the thing is i am not entirely against the idea of letting womens do jobs but i am against the culture and envirnment of jobs its ok for a grl to be an engineer its totally fine its ok but the job environement should be more promissing and more  protecting see many grls are harrassed in offices and work spaces by the culture there their are many and i think lots of videos on social media circulating u can see them urselvs of grls getting touched at inappropirate places and etc why beacuse of the office job culture the places are clingy and cramped up with 50 to 60 popels in a single hall so the environment womens should be treated with due respect and with due kindness and i also think womens should aloso become doctors then how will childrens be born and etc other prognancy and women stuff issues etc u get the point so there isnt a black and white war between faminists and patriaarchal pople its more of a gray area in between so do adress every iddue i think ithis topic should be adressed more and more poroperly ok so let me know ur thoughts on this topic btw i am only teeling u my pov not saying that u should absolutly folow this but do consider these points too dont become a blind eye to these topics obv u dont want ur siter ur mother ur wife to be harrsses and ain any type of rape case f harrassment case u will prbaby kill that guy if u knew that was hapening at that moment or u wont want ur doughter to be in a illicit relation with a narcissit guy who jst want to dat her for the body and dont want t marry her and give her her rights and jst run away after sex and after imporegnannting and leaving her with life trauma and guilt and i think u are also aware of society so she wont get marries or have proper relatin with another guy after that i think u know it more and understnad this too her see u get the point .

Bro what about selective recruitment in companies? Even though women receive reservation in competitive exams and I am not against that but they even so are prioritized in recruitment processes. What is you view regarding this situation?
"How stupid thing that you make similarity with organs, how you ignore the physical and mental difference which is huge between man and women.plz dont use exception as examples. Right should  not given to them who has the tendency to misuse or abuse them."

"What does the first letters of ""FEMIN""ISM describe. As an personal opinion, the ideology is absolutely correct, but the word itself is not United towards everybody.... 
I think the word should be discussed too. Otherwise the ideology could be misunderstood.

Women loves men whom they feel high for. It is not patriarchal mindset because the theory of cultural Marxism is wrong. It's genetic programming. Women feel dissatisfied and frustrated when they feel their man is weak.

Very very nice
Worth watching.... nowadays im watching only Dhruv's videos in YouTube 💫💗
Aagree dude
Superb Dhruv rathee 🫡
You did not even speak about equality vs equity and wrongful reservation given to non deserving women killing meritocracy.
"24:42  ladki ko freely ghumne do to apne aap ko asman ka sitara samjhne lgenge, aur admi ko freely ghumne diye jaye fir v vo apne aap ko jamin par hi mahsoos krenge."
"11:28 that's the difference between men and women, so if someone wants 100% equality for men and women then, it's wrong.

we can't give 100 percentage equality for both gender,

for example in buses there are reserved seat for women but not for men, why? where's the equality.

men and women are different, and should be given different preference and not equal preference and opportunities."
Bhai itni knowledge late kha se  ho 😮 crazy  i salute your  education or  passion. Great 👍👍👍👍👍 absolutely 💯

"This has a Jabardast video contents. you picked up all difficult points and clarified all of them. What I regret though is for  not been able to find and watch a female YouTuber who is raising points like you and giving gyan to idiot males. Females have to learn to fight for her corner. But problem for them is also that they don't get any support in society from anyone. It is a long fight. Majority of Indian movies show the drooling males. Most stories start from ogling and making life difficult   for college, work going females. So, you are certainly doing a great job."
After so many years of struggle still feminism has a long way to go. Thank you for such an eye-opening video.
Love and respect from Pakistan bro ♥️🥰
The kid is speaking old books....but the clashes has gone another level
Thank you❤
Obsessed to watching your videos…❤
"dhruv bhaiya , i am an class 10 th student and in my school girls are given always priority more than boys ,is that a good thing ....   NO !!! in my opinion the main reason for this behviour of men is because nowadays women are getting more priority , and that's not good for upcoming genration .😖"
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Each and Everyone should be a feminist and promote feminism 🗿
Finally someone who understands
Respect multiplied ❤
I want to change the word feminist to Humanist so that people stop thinking its not only about female rights.

Respect male and female both
Amazing video 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Mza agya yrr❤❤❤
i love your videos 🤩
Hamara funda saaf hai main Muslim hun
why you dont make videos in INDIA
Best video ever❤
"You did not describe how and what has really and effectively Feminism has done for Men. Plus in your previous video you highlighted the unstable mindset of protagonists Kabir Singh & Ranvijay, you did not break down the sick side of Four more shots, and films similar to that. Are you afraid of the guidelines?    I really support you, but I think as a male, I quite disagree with you on this one. Please do not just scroll away"
😊
"I'm not against feminism but want to increase my knowledge in it. It is said that females are not equally paid as man for the same work and same education qualification because men can be kept late at night for working while woman can't be and also because of maternity leave 
Can someone give me a strong argument against it? 






Another doubt In my girl's  hostel we girls are not allowed to get out of the hostel after 8 pm but boys don't have any such timings so is it correct to have so? What about the dangers at night with girls like being getting raped or kidnapped?"
"Intrusting, but life never compared with any writer"
The real world is far from the ideal world he describes. In the real world feminist ideology means freedom from men. More and more women are considering marriage as slavery imposed upon them my men and heading for divorce. Very soon most men will disappear leaving only women and finally destruction of human race. Thanks to feminism.

Acha bola bhi ❤

Br Ambedkar feminist he was always support women ❤
Kalpana chaula.. Died not for family.. But for dreams... Dreams of men... And men who died with her is not remembered... Hearys of women is small... They can speak for hundreds of minute... But man can only speak 5 min because of biological reason.... God is the creator... We must live... And stop being GOD
Ye mindset girls and boys dono me hona chahiye

"Hello bro! I am from Pakistan, I heard about you for the first time from my nephew, but I saw your video after the revolution you brought in India's 2024 election and I was very impressed by this video. Your words are very logical and understanding. You are very good. It is working. I wish that all young people make videos on conscious topics like yours, which instills confidence in people and the right understanding of establishing personal opinion. May you always be successful. Love from 🇵🇰 pakistan zindabad ❤"
"dhruv, you help me clear out my opinions so much. I used to think i am not a feminist because it means promoting women's activities in a wrong way. i understand SO much better now, thanks man, i was so wrong lol"
Always right tell well done ❤😊
"One of my school teacher used to tell us that every girl should be financially independent. Lest, the girl who is not financially independent, can't give any statement in any kind of issue.She won't get any respect in family. But, I think that she should tell us every people should be financially independent. Lest,both male and female, won't get any respect in family or society. In this era,this is the ultimate truth.But, some so called feminists like to talk about faminism by using the hate words about male.Actually, they don't know the real meaning of faminism.Sometimes, they think that they are talking about women's rights and respect but they don't.They insult the women more by doing gender discrimination in their own way."

Bro the feminist about which you are talking about doesn't exist anymore.
"16:40 jab ladiyan express karte hai tho unkemadadh bechari samajkar ladkekardete hai.
but agar ladke eemotion ko express karte hai tho koyi bhi ladki madadh keliye age nahi ayegi. this is the reson ki ladke jab express karte hai tha bas o apne weekness aure secret public karte hai aur uske sambhalne wali koyi ladki nahi hogi.
aisa nahi hai ki ladke express nahi karte karte hai unhi ke samne jo unhe suna samje aur uska hal bataye.
lekin ladkiyon ki ye adath hai ki o har kisise apni problems share karti hai . aur ladke bechari samaj ke problems solve bhi karte hai."

"#11:30 Kya koi aurath berozgar admise shadi karegi. agar jawab yes hai tho mai Drove ke batonse sehmath hun. agar jawab na hai tho drove ji apna statment pe dhyan de. har bar mad aur aurath equal nahi hosakte. reson ye hai ki jahan bhi kaam kare o unko alag hi level ki insecurity hoti hai. iske wajah se mardh apna business karneki tareeka badalna padta hai. mardh late night thak kaam karsakte hai lekin aurton ki 6 baje ghar jana padta hai kyun in insecurities ke wajah se.
mardh aur aurath equal na honeki reson apke us job wali statment me hi hai. koyi bhi feminist hone wali ladki kabhi ye dawa nahi karegi ki han mai apni job karke ya salery karke apne boyfriend ya husband ki kharcha utaung.
agar ye faminisum wali soch ko lana hai tho 2no taraf se badlaw lana hoga naki ek taraf se."

Good work dhruv
M spellbound.. how beautifully Dhruv describe the entire issue with example.. I really hope people will understand now what the real feminism is... And the importance of it.. hats off Dhruv🙌🙌🙌
👍👌
Wow Dhruv your videos really inspired me. I wouldn’t say I am perfect. The society have conditioned in such a way that unknowingly you feel guilty about being a feminist or only see things from aspect. Like I never understood the gravity of men’s issues despite it always being in front of my eyes. But your videos definitely inspire self reflection which is a step towards progress
Bhai sarthak goel ko dekho 😅
Situation of a woman will improve when a woman will support another woman
"Man and Woman, are different, yet equal."
basically its all about humanity and human rights.protest whenever and wherever there is a human right violation.
"Patriarchy and pseudo feminism are secretly in love with each other. Just as a racist man loves to talk about another race for its backward mentality, so that the race is insulted , but he does nothing to remove their backwardness,... alpha males love to talk about pseudo feminists but call them feminists so that they can tarnish real feminism. Fake feminists love to use patriarchy as an excuse to bully ,not the alpha males, but the men who really respect women. The love of patriarchy for pseudo feminism and vice versa is because..... they both are thirsty for power, by crushing social equality. The victims are the innocent men and women, at whom society always puts the blame."
"My thoughts  . In Some case Women's  need more priority, more power than men, same for men  too, so you can't expect equality"
There is nothing more turning off than a man who mocks feminism and says they are not a feminist. It’s like saying I dnt believe in equality in 2024. They are ignorant and have graduated from ‘Instagram Sigma Edit University’. Bunch of 🤡

Feminism is the  most misunderstood  word...few ppl today propagate against it...thanks for making this video. I'm a stay home mom...who teaches a little...I've seen ppl disapproving me as a feminist....I have immense respect for the male in my life...but I believe in equality...thanks for clarifying here👏✨️ may there be more men like you🎉🙏
Thank you so much for this video🤍

"Sir, I think there is another reason else than conditioning why women surrender to patriarchy. It is because it takes less energy, power of execution of heavyweight  brain work, or physical exercises. It undoubtedly is easy to become an average housewife than becoming an employee in this competitive job world."
Thank you for video ❤❤❤
"I hope more people watch and support this video, just like they have with your other videos"
"This is my first time watching your video, and I can't stop! I don't know Hindi, but I love watching your videos, and the subtitles are a huge help. I'm really thankful for your effort and the role you're playing in changing society."

Your Research is very Deep...I love that
Dr.B R Ambedkar was also a Feminist ....what is your opinion comment please
"Forget feministy, masculinity, we are humanity. Thank you Dhruv"

dhruv bhai i agree with you in each and every thing but this one i couldn't .
Goutam Buddha and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar were upholder of Gender Equality.
Love you son ❤
Thanks for making this vedio for those ppls .......who doesn't understand
"I'm a proud faminist, a LGBTQ+ rights supporter. My only argument is everyone is equal & should be treated equally. LGBTQ+ people  don't even get human rights in India -we can't choose who gets human rights and who doesn't ! It's sad to have that audacity."
Not only india but the worl- feminism is destroying society around the world.
👏🏻💯
raising a child is a important work to build a strong nation. if a women doing mens work who will raise the generation?
"If someone reads about (Prophet Muhammad “P.B.U.H”) He/She can solve all the issues and can live greater life. In addition, people don't care about the character they are following even if He/She is wrong, but we shouldn't be depended on our elders  that what they are doing so should we do. So, be careful, even our elders can be misguided by so called “The Culture”."
"Sir you say about billi Eilish When She says My body my fuc***  choice. 
Is this not faminism"
payal and tina jain youtubers are also kind of patriarchal... just see their content
"@Dhruv you’ve answered your own question.  What is being portrayed and used as feminism today is not the original and real feminism.  However, this is what it is today.  And this feminism is what people dislike.  The 2nd thing is, when you have rights you have to act sensibly and rationally, not emotionally.  Sadly many women use emotions to make decisions.  Then people wonder what was the point of having rights if you mess up that privilege."
Wonderful thoughts n proper explanation.  Feminism is not putting down men or villainising men. Men r also equally affected. ❤

Such an enlightening video.Thank you❤
"The problem is people are uneducated about this, they promote or have false perceptions of patriarchy and feminism, and they don't even realize that, that's why educating young men and women is important, although I disagree on certain points like ""equal pay"" because it's not as simple as you described here the equation of equal pay is a multivariate equation and patriarchy is one of the variable not the only one variable. Overall thank you for explaining nicely!"
"mad respect for you, dhruv. keep it up!"
In today's world a most common disease which is prevailing in our society leading to different crimes is so called extramarital affairs so if a woman knows that a man is married then why the hell she couldn't stop him to make relationship with her n save other woman's dignity who is wife of that stupid man but no she would encourage a man only to leave her jabki pata hai ki wo aadmi tujhko bhi dhokha hi dega baad mein kyunki uski fitrat mein hai wo toh stop toh humko hi karna padega na ...i know exceptions r always there but then u mutually get seperate with respect why the hell u ditching ur married partner n here woman plays imp role in both scenarios..we should stop playing victimized on very first instance
I think you are impacted. I am not in side of patriarchy but I am not in the side of feminism also. I will prioritize giving proper right according to ones qualification. Do whatever you want to do but rising or increasing social problem will not be accepted. But if you observe to the deep of our society you will found there's a lot of insect around us who are belonging from both gender and they are breaking our social norms which are count as welfare customs. They want something really different from welfare customs. They are ill minded and they never think the impact of their behavior on our society.
That's the reason woman opsite of women right they said we have more enough Rights 😢😢
Dhruv bhai ... U r very much right n totally justifiable but being a woman I must add that in mostly cases mainly in our country a woman is suffered by another woman only bcoz we r the first one who doesn't respect another woman n mostly do their character assassin..in a traditional family a woman is a victim of another woman's torture whether it's in any role so first of all we should learn to respect the another woman n take a stand if anything going wrong with them in a particular family or society bcoz we r the first one who blames a woman only if anything happens wrong with them...women r always more stronger n superior than men since ages so why they want to be equal to men n pull themselves behind 😂😂 n if it's so then why seats reserved for women they should also commute standing as they r equal...its all a typical mindset
Politics was enough Dhruv. This topic is highly debatable considering the stupidity feminism has led the world into
"15:37  I differ from dhruv, I don't know which data he is giving but I personally saw that men are more open minded they don't afraid  to be mocked rather  our female freinds have a sense of insecurity even more among their female freinds. 

Men and women though are same species but their biology is completed different,sorry to say men are more aggressive though they shouldn't whereas women are normally kind hearted biologically. 
Jaise sc or St ko agar equality dena chahte Hain to unko reservation se o equality ata hain ap to tab nehi bolte e koi alag species Hain kya inko reservation milta hain.
The term equality has vast implications.
And please answer why women reservation is being given if we all are same.
Dhruv sorry to say you are not right here"
"No I don't think you are right in such regards....

Thanks bro🎉
Sad reality is that women are the worst enemy of women.
It is truly said that women are the only enemies of the other women
"At the end of the day, Men and Women have equal rights but not equal responsibilities.  Everyone speaks about their rights, but not duties. Men have an exponentially greater duty than women that is to protect and provide for women. If you understand that, you will know that even it's a disgrace if all jobs that Men are supposed to take up are already taken up by women because their male boss loves to hire them instead.. what will you make of this ? How do you expect Men to lead the family like a king if this is the situation in the society ? Yes Men are always the culprits behind many evil motives, it's just that women are falling victim to their evil motives as well. At the end of the day these so called bullshit feminists are serving none other than these evil men in their attempt to tag themselves superior or equal. Don't fall for men. Instead make them responsible for you. Make them work hard to be a real macho, who can provide for you and protect you. What if Sharukh khan's Wife Gauri khan said she wants to be the super star and kicked him out of his roles and came to the fore front ? Bizarre right ? SRK will be SRK only if he found peace and support back at home. And he will be remembered as a great man as long as he provides and takes good care of his family including the women around him, his sister, his wife, his daughter. And that's why people like SRK, CR7, Messi are all respected, not because they are amazing talents, because they dress up and act like Men. That's what a real Man is supposed to be. Not just sacrifice his power for his family, but the society as a whole. That's why Bhagat Singh is revered as well. Let women allow men to lead, but make sure the man you chose is worthy of being a true leader. That's it, problem solved..So get educated first. Don't follow Bollywood fantasies. Education is must for all, there's no gender priority."
Your contribution to society in moulding a socially and politically aware and educated youth is so huge. Thank you for your amazing work 🙏

"Hi Dhruv ! 
I had this in mind since a long time but wasn’t sure if i should say it. 
After months of watching your videos , i feel like i can . 
I really wish that you make a video on female hormones , changes in female body , menstruation , menopause , pregnancy, child birth , postpartum  and various other painful cycles that a woman goes through. I think our society needs awareness on this subject and coming from you would mean a lot .

Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us ♾️ keep it coming star"
"I understand ur point abou Equality... But if we try to invoke that totally, then there shouldn't be maternity leaves, reserved trains & coaches, special security for women...

"Men and women are not same if we talk about hierarchy men must be above but rights should be given equally .

Finally someone said it❤❤❤ you clearly explained the true essence of feminism...it was never Abt men VS women but femininst VS patriarchy. I don't know why some people fail to understand it. I'm a feminist obvs and I'm so happy to see how wonderfully explained the whole concept of feminism .❤ respect ❤

One thing I would say is that you didn't mention the mindset of those girls who thinks that drinking ,being half naked , being disrespectful, always want to do what they want to do even if it's bad for them and more etc.

I hope you understand what I'm saying !

"but mr dhruv rathee , let me remind you that in saravjeet singh and Jasleen kaur fake case all womens and girls supported jasleen kaur before court's decision came which were not right whatever girls and womens did with saravjeet singh by mistake also by supporting Jasleen kaur all females did not done right

"Steps to fix this issue 
1. Get rid of both toxic masculinity and toxic feminity.
2. Take actions against people who are promoting this form of toxic masculinity and feminity.
3. Educate all the toxic men who are like ""women belong in the kitchen, women shouldn't be allowed to vote or get education"" and women who openly criticise men in term of wealth, height, looks ,making all the men feel unsecure and in particulary the younger generations who think that being a boss bitch is a good thing or objectifiying men is normal."

This is psuedo feminism which showcases toxic behaviour and defames the need and importance of actual feminism
"You really smash with your videos. You have dispelled at one stroke all the wrong notions one had on feminism. Your level of detailed research is mindboggling. How men too suffer under patriarchy was very beautifully brought out. About women's voting rights, I was stunned to note that there were indeed women who were against women's voting rights.
You could have added that some countries which are projected as great , like Switzerland for instance, gave voting rights to women very late , in the late sixties, I think, and that too after years of protests. Whereas Indian constitution makers were so good that nobody needed to agitate to get a vote"
Why dont we use word equity rather than equality...like woman and man are not equal but sure they both deserve fairness in everything sooo quity is good word
"I draw my life
Disegno la mia vita e la mia storia
Di un giorno quando piccola e indifesa
Mamma e papà mi portarono qui
I draw my life
Малюю моє життя
Quando il mondo è violento un futuro non ha
I draw my life
Малюю моє життя
Quando il sogno si spegne la paura ti prenderà
I bambini non giocavano (non giocavano)
Ma fuggivano (fuggivano)
Con le mamme e i papà (la malvagità)
La malvagità
Nel cielo non brillava mai il sole
Le strade erano vuote nel silenzio
Ogni città, ogni giorno così
I draw my life
Малюю моє життя
Quando il mondo è violento un futuro non ha
C'era chi pregava per la pace, ma poi
Piangeva come noi, piangeva come noi
Lasciando la sua casa, la sua vita per poi non
Non tornare più, più
Non c'è pace, non c'è amore
Quando il colpo di un cannone
Rompe il silenzio, scuote la notte
Ed il mondo chiude gli occhi
La vita tutta dentro una valigia
I soldi in una tasca, ma non piena
Con noi partì la speranza, e così
I draw my life
Малюю моє життя
Quando il mondo è violento un futuro non ha
I draw my life
Малюю моє життя
Quando il sogno si spegne la paura ti prenderà
I draw my life
Малюю моє життя
Quando il mondo è violento un futuro non ha
Disegno la mia vita e la mia storia
E dopo un lungo viaggio nella notte
Tutto cambiò, ora io sono qui
I bambini non giocavano (non giocavano)
Ma fuggivano (fuggivano)

Dhruv. Just see the comments on YouTube and other social media sites. You CAN literally see women defending neha dhupia and murderer like Suchana Seth JUST because they're female.
"The table is set for what actual feminism means.

Thanks for this video."
"ukraine russia war and talibans are proof this world dont need feminism .. where men ensures security feminism only exist there...all women talks about equal right but not equal consequence..they want to have female privilege and men privilege too.. well a wife chained a man .. beats him in india will never become the news but if the gender is reversed...
when a man is accussed of fake rape.. he is guilty till  proven innocent.. even he is proved that he is innocent .. the bad mark in his life remains..i am shocked DHRUV RATHEE overlooked this ... like this there a lot of problems for men .. but he is a man he will face it like a man right?? from the beginning of earth till now .. there was no matriarchal system in world ..and if it happens nothing cchanges for man . the hard jobs will must be done by men .. women are not capable of it ... these feminist will never volunteer for these jobs ... anyway at the end no will see mens suffering .. it will be overlooked all the time.."

Thankyou sir

Nature doesnt create hierarchy ? What a fool.
Luckily world is going to get better after a slight turbulence ...women so far have enjoyed the luxuries and comfort provided by men they forgot how hard the world really is...not any more .the ongoing wars and the inevitable conflicts about to come will show women their true place and who men really are

Respect those women who actually deserve it✔️ in this generation there is no difference between men and women...🗣️"
Isliye bolte hai adha adhura Gyan rkhne se achha Gyan hi ni Lena chahiye kisi ko kuch bhi bana dete hai log
Dhruv rathee is an educated and intelligent person. Only people who have no proper education or intelligence would cry about women in name of feminism
"His precision and approach towards this is hats off, doesn't make is it sound partial and make it understandable. With great clarity for both the ladies and gentlemen. Great one 👏"
"I have been a great fan of your explanations. However, in this video regarding Feminism. Let me add a few points...
1. Have you ever experienced FEMALE EGO
2. Do you know about feminine stubbornness? 
3. Why do girls have a different chess tournament while male tournaments are open for all yet girls got almost Zero achievement. 
4. In many job appointments boys are seriously discriminated against and same there about promotions.
5. OH... About what you said about being lonely because Boys cant share feelings. You are completely wrong. BOYS ARE WAY MORE OPEN AND SHARING THAN WOMEN."
यह सब बातें सब सुनने को अच्छा लगता है असलियत में वैसा कुछ होने वाला नहीं है

His intention is not opposing toxic feminism that Bollywood is spreading but showing part content of Hinduism to change the real context.

"Understanding the main focus of feminism and respecting the other gender is being the real alpha male. Patriarchy and male dominance in the society is way too glorified by some people. In the simplest words, Feminism is just being a wise human being."

"Contribution of genders in family before feminism 
Men: earning 
Women: cooking, chores, birth and childcare 

After feminism 
Men: earning 
Women: cooking, chores, birth and childcare + earning 

Where’s equality if women are always doing more?"
Respect for you man ♥
Nice video
He's a real MARD
All respect from assam ur way Dhruv🫶🏻❤️❤️❤️
I think women has their own rights and men has their own rights so why comparing them. Like why comparing both genders

I absolutely agree the fact that men should be allowed to show emotion. But my opinion is both men and women should be emotionally strong. Plus current feminism is just equality where women geet privilege. Like how there are laws that protect women. Some women exploit these laws. The man's life is destroyed if she accusses him of sexual assault. But otherwise I agree with your points
"From the part 5:38 was sooo sooo true man! Bohot larkiya independent soch ki hoti hai, feminist hoti hai but at some point of time, wo ye karti hai just to fit in the society, just for acceptance, just taaki log unhe pasand kare specially uske families"
"As a girl, I cant stop myself from commenting..

"THE REALITY IN OUR SOCIETY ACCORDING TO MY RESEARCH IS EQUALITY=MATRIARCHY.....🧐🧐 FOR WHICH MEN SUFFER MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY BY WOMEN IN OVERALL BASIS....🧐🧐 WHICH NO ONE WANT TO TALK.....😤😤
IF YOU OBSERVE THE ECOSYSTEM BETWEEN NATURE AND US ....🧐 YOU CAN CLEARLY NOTICE ""DOMINANCY AND DEPENDENCY""  INSTEAD OF ""FEMINISM""...🧐 FOR MAINTAINING BALANCE.....🧐
SO ""FEMINISM"" IS NOTHING BUT A POLITICAL TERM....😤🧐🧐"

"As a teenage boy , on many points i agree with Dhruv and there are some points i dont agree with him 

•Both male and female are equal but unique , lets say a male is going in military it doesnt mean if a female doesnt go it makes her not equal to a man 

•Patriarchy does actully affect males , i understood that after listening to this man , Its actually true if i cry infront if my father i would be labled as a weak girl , if i get hurt in the field and sit in the corner , my mates , teachers tells me not to Cry , 

# A man can only be emotional infront of God or their wife or maybeee their mother and father"

"THAT's what I love about you Dhruv, just when I think I know, I get to learn much from your videos & realize how much I didn't know about what I should know. I will also look up this lovely Indian Feminist who speaks against Patriarchy. I just LOVE to see Indian women taking a bold stand against male dominance - Esp. when looking most feminine & lady-like NOT compromising their femineity or appearing masculine to achieve equality. Westerners who think Indian women are submissive & expected to be - DON'T know Indians - And they certainly don't know Indian women well enough. Here's Another 👍from me in USA✌!!"
Excellent

99.99% successful societies are patriarchal and with the help of latest technology faminism became some what viable but it is now starting to fall apart again and in the west most women are miserable according to almost all studies and many of them turned to prostitution for success. faminism is bullshit of highest order

Bro why is this video not being shown on National Television?
To want a career is everyone's right. But in my opinion motherhood is the greatest honor in the univers and only women have this privilege.
Another addition will be bhashak on Netflix
"This video is filled with logical fallacies specially quoting from famous people. Information is vastly available but also ignorant is at its peak. In today’s world feminism has become demonising men and showing ungratefulness what men has done for women. Statistically, today’s infrastructure is still run by men and women are least interested to take jobs such as cleaning sewage systems, taking risk jobs etc. There is a really good book The Rational Male by Rollo Tomassi who explains the reason of so many divorce rates and the evolving phases a woman undergo in her life. Lastly, it isn’t wise to say women to be at home and nurturing the family because everyone should realise what they can contribute to build a healthy family. If the objective is to both parents being out for work and send their children to daycare then this isn’t a family but an organise market govern by state."

Aamir Khan is feminist lol yet he was unable to save his marriage life 😂😂
The word feminist and gender equalist....They r not the same words...And if they mean the same thing....why are they used differently?....What does masculinist mean than?....Is it not the same as gender equalist....Why make a term that doesnt make any sense?
It’s a topic of big argumentative. I believe on feminism strongly but also my belief is: in some sector girls are stronger than men or boys. Also same in some sectors boys are stronger are than women or girls. It’s by natural. It’s true we both have similarities by body parts unless 2/3. But that’s not the main point because we are running by our brain power also HORMONES. They are controlling us by our ways. Finally in some field’s job or factors where gender doesn’t matter their we have to be feminists to make our society nice and peaceful. Thanks.

HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE BEST VIDEOS I'VE SEEN ON THIS TOPIC! Explores the issue from every possible perspective and dispels every possible misconception. But I doubt if those who are already knee deep in these misconceptions will still learn anything.😢
Hindi word for Patriarchy is pitrsatta (पितृसत्ता)
Itna sensible bhi koi exist krta hai really 🙏
"Very informative and well-constructed video! Would love to see another video going more into intersectional feminist issues, especially discussing how patriarchal attitudes harms the LGBTQ community."
Why doesn't Islam give women this right bro??
"The problem is with the word. To someone who just listens it, it sounds like women having upper hand than men."
Dhruv rathi ❤ exactly correct
Who are from West Bengal??
"Yes, feminism is about equal rights and opportunities. While men don’t always vocalize their struggles as much, women actively fight for their rights. I believe that movies shouldn’t promote toxic behavior, and while the film ‘Animal’ does show toxic behavior, I don’t think it glorifies it as much as some claim. However, toxic men are influenced by it, just as women might be influenced by shows like ‘Four More Shots,’ which I think does glorify certain behaviors.

In this video, Dhruv Rathee mentioned some feminists who address issues on both sides, and I believe these are the real feminists. They speak up when women are oppressed but also when women are the oppressors. True feminism involves advocating for justice and equality for everyone, regardless of gender. Being silent when men suffer isn’t true feminism. Unfortunately, there are people who claim to be feminists but remain silent when men suffer, and that’s not in line with genuine feminist values. And they are not feminists but they claim to be feminists."
these things are good on paper

"God originally created women to raise children and take care of the family. And created men to earn by hard work.  But if a woman has no means, she can earn . Remember one thing we are not wiser than the creator. The more a man works, the more his testosterone hormone will increase or his masculinity will increase. And if women leave the family to raise children like men If he works hard, he will develop a masculine mentality.  Don't want to have children. In this way, the human race will disappear.  Remember one thing if man and woman were one then you would not exist."

"If any one says patriarchy means beating, insulting, or degrating the position of female then its not true, if it is commonly practice in anciant time( becouse not atall posibal in modarn time) then its wrong.. This is a negative side of petriarchy which arise from social evil( becoz wrong people always do evil thing, and it has no treatment / semilarly wrong women always take advantages of feminism in a evil way, even though feminism is good for socity) . ..  There is a positive side of patriarchy, which gives us not Exactly equall amount of rights (which is not posibal for various physical emotional bondages) but in a fair propotunate based on law of nature.. Every body is not equally efficient in dowing evey work... Therefor acording to the law of nature man / women devide their work acording to their capability of dowing the work efficiently.. Irrespect of modarn man made philosophy but the genune truth is man and women are not same from any condition, so plese 🙏 sorry but absolute  equality cannot be lies here.. So petriarchy devide the positon of male, female for social benifits acording to law of nature.. Is the positve aspect of petriarchy..."
"Petriarchy is not bad but very important for every domestic affair.. Becouse in every place their must be a head, boss, ledar.. Same in family there must be a head not to disturb u but to controll... There is lot to say why a male member needs to be head of a family, some of the reson u may recognize... Thats why in short petriarchy is not bad.. But yes in this long run of petriarchal history some dark and negative mening of it has been attach which shod be condamed.. Itself patriarchy is not bad but some negative mindsat has attach whic is shown in this video very clearly... On the other hand feminism has also some negative impact in this socity, which u can also see in present and so call modarn socity.. I hope dhrub sir will also make a video soon showing too much of being feminism is also dangerous for family, socity, and female too.. Too much of any thig is dangerous is my point.."
"In my opinion, men and women are made differently with biological and physical differences, but both deserve to be equally treated with equal opportunities. Its a fact that we get to see most of the mine workers, construction workers and soldiers are men. On the other hand, most of the teachers, nurses and babysitters are women.  As all of these are important, we must respect both the genders. However, we must also encourage if a girl wants to become a pilot or become a soldier or a man wants to look after his children and do housework. Here, I didn't mean to demean any gender but to make all realise that it's not men vs women but men and women. All of us deserve to live our own way of life. And we must respect those who deserve it, irrespective of gender."

"16:40 Patriarchy is not destroying anything. Don't forget it's the ""Patriarchal System"" that's been going on since the early ages and all these technologies + infrastructure that you see around yourself was made possible under the Patriarchal System. I myself support women's rights but when movements like Feminism is only famous for their vulgarity & toxicity like their counterparts (toxic masculinity in animal movie etc) what do you expect? If you want to see the detrimental effects of feminism then you should see where it's coming from. See the american family system, see the family courts in the United states, see how they are not able to define what a woman is. This is a path which will lead you astray. 

All those toxic (stupid) kids with childhood issues who labels themselves as ""Alpha"" or ""Sigma"" Male are equal to those feminists with daddy issues."

"Sadly bollywood is getting worst in the name of Feministim they justified moral less & ethic (less) characters. Feminism is not just about drinking alcohol/having sex with multiple partners (including honeytrap, cheating etc). 
Once upon a time they were good movie like english-vglish, superstar (were a Muslim wanted to be singer fight against her toxic father with her mother) ,pink many more 
But now lipstick under murkha, veeray di wedding like movies make me disgust... 
I heard a story from my mom before we got independence Britishers never wanted women to have ""right for vote"" Even the nerve of them they wanted all indian men to accept this but thankful everyone (including men & women) rejected this suggestion.

"But today feminism is all about doing what ever they want, hurting others and not taking accountability for their mistakes!!! That’s why I don’t call myself a feminist, but i do believe in the initial concept where women got opportunity to vote, study and be free like a man. Everyone should have equal opportunity and get what they deserve."
Those who think he is right then what's your thoughts about religion?
Thanks for coming in our life🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I think censor board should not allow movies like Animal. They are not doing their job in right way.

"FEMINISM will be always a CANCER. feminism seems like its a noble idea but feminism indirectly harmful for our girls. i dont support feminism that doesnot mean that i dont respect our girls and dont think about our girls' rights. for our woman rights, we just need to remove superstitions from our society and broad our mind and heart for women. but that doesnot mean we need to support feminism. Actually, feminism is a agenda from the western countries to brainwash our girls and make them deviated from their actual and respectful path. 

DHRUV RATHEE, though you are a truth-researcher man( you always try to deliver us the truth ), i am not agree with your thinkings about feminism."

"All this you said is good to listen to and applies really good in theory. Unfortunately the reality looks different.

If you earn less than your woman, let me see if she respects you then. 
If you don't reply back in a fight with another man, let me see if your wife respects you."
"If feminism means equality why we need free bus service for women ,why free education for girls ,why need money only for poor girls and not poor boys don,t know but indian has evil feminism and illitrate people will support it just simple example if jhonny deep was indian he would wasted his life in jail i am not saying we don,t need feminism but indian and illitrate gov promoting toxic feminism more ."
Feminism is the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes. ideologically it wants to do good but when it comes to action it does not address issues on men side.
wrong parenting has made all men just waste product in India.

"Feminism is the worst topic to discuss women may get some rights to study or work or support his family but their is one most hidden nature of females is when they achieve something they do not understand something next to it due to this nature the surrounding get effected when the man earn they always support their family their wife and children but when the women earn 80% they do not understand their parents or their husband next to them evn they divorse them and even they start going with this dirty relationship with the man's so this is not fair with the mans they are not fools to marry them and take their responsibility of the man would have same feelings as a women so many will never marry to anyone and the whole upcoming generation will be destroyed 

Women cannot be like mans never never they always treats man like dogs they just marrry rich man why because they required money and sex from us nothing"
Suicidal rate of man is not exclusively related with loneliness. You should have added a maybe. . . Good amount of deaths are after marriage due to false cases. 498A misuse is quite common.

"Exactly that same situation happened to me ,when i am in college,i tried to be friendly and more outgoing to remove shyness and i talk to everyone,so i made lot of friends including boys and girls but after sometime my male friends used to tell me that ,those girls who are not friendly and do not hangout with guys are more sanskari and jave more respect in men eyes and they want to marry those type of girls and your tupe of girl usually,people doubt on your character,that u are easy
I was shocked and sad ,i was just being friends with everyone,how can this says anything on my character,mene kya galat kiya
Tb se i didn't make any male friends and i don't talk to boys much, only when its needed related to study,otherwise i don't 
Because that's how some boys think
She is too easy ,and she is not sanskari  (patriarchal mindset)
I was stupid that i was also following this to came in the criteria of sanskari but now i feel 
I don't want to prove it...i am a nice girl and if they judge me that their problems not mine"

Fulan Devi ka bhi koi video banai hai sar
in my cast i have seen giving girls equality but it turned out to that my cast girls have become shameless now. They wear exposing clothes and have 5 or body counts even divorced more 3 times and 90% of the time it was boy who was a good guy and still suffered. That's why i don't believe in equality like this.
The fact is that we don't try to know the actual truth.  We just try to justify our thoughts with a few news and infos . Its the main problem ongoing in this society. We often doesn't want to know the truth but always try to defend our thoughts and we often feel happy when the opposite gender getting hates. I feel the main reason here is ego. We want to justify our ego and thats what makes it worse

🔥🔥 woww
Worst video bro the main thing is when a boy is rich he can change a poor women's life but a rich woman will never ever look at a poor man
Yes men and more violent than women.
"I personally want women to be on par with men, but there are somethings we cant change, like the biology of male and female..
Men are built stronger than women in many aspects and they take advantage of that better stats to be the better than their female counterparts.
We have to accept this, there are some areas where women cant beat a man 1 on 1 no matter what happens.
But does that mean we shouldn't encourage women to do it, absolutely not...
We need to encourage and give opportunities to women in the exact same way we give to men, but just be realistic and fair.

I personally dont believe in equality, rather i believe in equity.
If the person has potential to complete a job regardless of what gender he or she is they have to be given the same opportunities and chances to shine, and paid on what and how they did the work efficiently, if the men did it better because it requires some good physical attributes then he has to be paid more. But the problem is, if the same happens then the toxic feminist will come and cling like they are showing patriarchy, im not paid as same as him.

Feminism was and is great and good for the women who really deserves it, but there are people who wants revenge on men and wants to control men, just because our forefathers did the same, this what draws the line 

As long as feminists wants equity they can have it, but if they want superiority, man then starts the gender wars 

If you have the potential to do something there is nothing that should stop you from doing the same, if something does, then you have all the rights to fight for it ......"

Chahe baccha ho ya bada, school ho ya duniya, ye sab ek sacchai hi hain."

Bro I want to ask some thing okay what your saying that feminist has the equal right. example boy touched the girl mistake and the girl will take action on him what should we call them.what if boy is not guilty but your saround are making feel it guilty what should we called and is that right ?. And if a boy or man slap them back people will say see he slap the girl how is it equal by the way ?
Statistic shows more divorces and broken homes after feminism in the western society ... Thus western society is in chaos at the social level..  And lastly why don't we see females in the Ukraine Russian war ? Is feminism only for peace time?..something is missing.

"Dear dhruv sir,
Please start making your clones because men like u r rare..."
"*So let's be real now*

Feminism does not define equality because ""Feminism"" is subjective and ""Equality"" is objective.

Equality is real and should be implemented so Women can Vote and do Jobs if they have to but it's not necessary and I think we all can agree that a woman's actual biggest fever in real Life is to support her family emotionally because scientifically speaking women are more emotional and mentally and physically weak s soft, and that's absolutely attractive, powerful, healthy, better for a Good women and aggressively needed by men. Only with these kinds of women have we as Men thrived in Technology, Moral standards, Health, politics, economy, and most Important Emotional well-being through the ages.

Feminism is delusional/fake and should be stopped because it's a cancer with Hypocrisy. Many feminists don't want equality they straight-up hate men, Why? because no men want a Little screaming Girl to be their wife, Talk about feminism until a thief broke into the house. Feminists will do Jobs but being a mother and cleaning s cooking for children and husband is too much burden, who will marry a girl who talks delusional equality of feminism. They want a cultured, charismatic, tall, strong, father figure man but don't have any qualities that men want of a Mother, a Wife. feminism is the Ignorance/Immaturity of delusional females.

and I am not an Alpha or Sigma or patriarchal. *I am a Realist*"
You ❤
"Even my mom is filled with partrichial ideology. She said to my elder brother to get married and have children to continue the family after my sister-in-law's death and he did it. But, coming to my point, she never insisted me to get marry after my separation from my husband for ten years.

But, still, I'm happy and leading a peaceful life with my only kid."
Toxic Feministic Boomers is a much better word 😂😂😂
Boys will be boys se yad aya mera ek friend tha wo abhi bhi milta hai mere se pr ab friend nhi raha.... wo bhi aisa hi tha play boy ek ladki se uska mn nhi bhrta tha...uski gf hote hue wo dusre ldki ko date kr raha tha baad me pta chla wo pehle se bohot sare ldko ko date kr rahi hai or currently do ya teen bfs hai uske😂.
Alpha male ko ileal male mana jata hai society me...alpha or Sigma bnne ka Trend chl raha hai abhi social media me ye log fakes hai bs...koi real Alpha male kyu khilad hoga female rights ke 🤷🏻‍♂️.
No doubt I'm feminist 🫡
"I am a Muslim and by cast a Pathan but I am a feminist because I want my daughter to be a pilot, a doctor, an engineer or an athlete whatever she want to do because Islam dosn't stop any female to do something for society even if you read the life of our Beloved Prophet Muhammad SAW, he awarded many women who did good for society and also made a nursing home and also gave a necklace to Hazrat Ghifarya RA on her services during war and even in pendimics. This is the real Islam and even every religion do that, no religion stop women to do something for society."

"Dhruv you have to understand that a female as WIFE is in a role designed by God.
An individual unmarried girl does not fall in this role .
Neither Patriarchy is good nor Matriarchy but God has a designed role, do not go UNKNOWINGLY  against standards of God.
He has more understanding than u, me or any other human.
It is guaranteed that with rise of feminism divorce will rise.
Im sure ur not aware of power of prayers, or you have never talked to God and understood his views.
That's why ur touching a complex issue without much understanding.
Im not supporting patriarchy but u need to understand few things. This is true that in terms of money, or career or certain more things females have equal rights. But marriage is an institute and we need more righteous kids to be born. A normal male can be a successful businessmen,  or have good career or can even cry but we also need males whose prayers are accepted by God. Otherwise things will become worse like divorce, or birth of more unrighteous kids being born.  Plz try to understand how spiritual world operates"

Men are leaders women are sustainers 
Submitting to husband shouldn't be forced it should come from within as a respect as love
Nobody wants annoying wife b! tching about feminism 
There's a thing called gender roles and its natural"
"Dhruv Rathee.. i just want to thankyou.. for making such a wonderful and unique video on you tube.. u literally won my heart today i like your other videos too but this video really touched my heart.. we need more intellectual ""humans"" like u who speaks for humanity.. people who are bad.. and maybe aren't humane blame everything on ""KALYUG""... but they dont know.. ki jis yug mein hum jee rhe hai vo hum par depend karta hai but no one actually wants to change in a positive way.. just bcz of the toxic culture around that being bad and abusing someone makes u look ""cool"" and ""strong"" sadly.. and honestly there is no logical explanation for that neither it is written in Gita or vedas.. its just that.. ppl are blindly consuming whatever they see on internet or those youtube shots called attitude status.. giving cheap dopamine to the youth of our country.. and there are endless points which i can give.. but its highly imp for us to know that the youth is getting deteriorated day by day.. and maybe your videos may bring a positive change in the society and would help to transform us.. i dont consider myself as perfect .. u changed my own thought process too.. i highly recommend u to make more videos on such topics which would change our thought process and makes ur more humane.. thankyou so much again ❣"
I am from pakistan but I like your videos bcoz it says facts and very informative

"Don't forget Guru Nanak who said "" why call women inferior who gave birth to Great people,kings philosophers, saints, warriors etc. in fact,through women, future generations come,within woman man is conceived""."
"Many people don't understand the difference, and very well explained."
"First of all Men and Women are not the same. The diversity between two of them and the differences of thought between them is the most beautiful thing in this world. Yes Men work, Men don’t cry, Men build, Men fight, Men feel absolutely amazing when they work on their physique, Men feel great when they conquer this world life has always been hard for them and they grow from this. I’m a Man and I can say these are the things that makes me feel fully alive. The Masculine side of Men and the feminine side of Women is the Nature’s beauty and what keeping our society at place otherwise society will collapse for sure. They can’t be same when it comes to natural behaviours and thoughts (which current bs feminism promotes) Biologically they are different and they have very different perspectives about this world believe me or not! It has nothing to do anything with any woman who is trying to build their career, working hard for a goal. It’s very nice for them if that’s what keeping them happy. But the truth is Men and Women are not the same but yes they can be treated equally politically, and they can be given equal rights, 

and tell me this what rights are Men getting that women don’t? Idk what.

Idk whether feminism has such a beautiful concept like dhruv explained but Western as well as Eastern society has taken it in a very ugly way like “Four shots bullshit series” and many 
- Behaving like a Man
- Ugly revealing dressing 
- Objectifying Men
- Saying all men are same
- Sleeping with 40 Men
- Partying and smoking too much.

Again these are the same things that are destroying Men also.
So the war is not between Men and Women. The real war is spiritual between these satanic and demonic rituals and bs agendas which is destroying this world’s society.

Of course 

I totally agree with dhruv what he is saying but Feminism has to stop because real feminism’s concept is disappeared in today’s age and will never come back!!"
Actually now I clear my concept about feminism.....Thanku Dhruv🙏
"I felt for tht first time you were a little bias… because claimed one side to be intelligent and intellectual and other as brainwashed and traditional… u fail to comprehend what may make sense to u may not necessarily make sense to other party… ever heard of radical feminist? Calling jus femeisim isnt sufficient nowadays with the fifth wave of feminism, there are many types within feminism that are against each other… feminism in 2024 is not the same as feminism before or the origin of feminism"
"Loved you for this video, Dhruv ❤❤. I have exactly the same mindset but don't find ears for it. Judgement should be based on the basis of being human and not genders."
"Females ko har jagah 50% ka adhikaar hona chahiye aur males ko 50%...

Lekin dhruv, aurat kabhi bolti hai, ""sharm aurat ka gehna hota hai"", Aur jab aaj unko open adhikar mil gaye hai to wo nangi ghum rahi hai...,

Aisi bahot si baatein hai...

Lekin Haan, bilkul aurato ko aadmi ke barabar adhikaar hona chahiye har jagah...."
Bhai tum par beeti nahi hai isaliye aisa bol rahe ho. Mere 2 dosto ne wife ko pareshan hokar suicide kar liya hai. Court passed judgement against the husband even he was not guilty and in the favour of wife even she was guilty. And his wife harrased him for dowry and maintenance. He was not able to earn even to feed himself but he paid her more than his capacity. Finally he committed suicide.😢 He was my best friend 😢
Islam gives women rights
Hi I know all this is right what you said but feminism also talks about each and every gender not just female and male..

"Hi, Dhruv Rathee. What’s about the corporate cultural? A lot of companies, they hire woman because she is a “woman”. Even though if she is not meet the criteria, but she do hire and get more pay her rather than man! She gets more J-curve in her career. If we compare with man. What will we call it?"
You earned  my respect 🙌
Wow. Just amazing. Explained beautifully. 🥰🥰🥰

"men and women are not equal but before court they are equal in most of the cases,"
"IMO it’s impossible to attain 100% feminism in this world because some women still believe in patriarchy and if women themselves think that then it’s just another good reason for a man to believe he has all the decision making power.

Also I’ve noticed that some of the reason behind this is the kind of serials made by the industry. I’m still baffled by the thought that nobody has raised a complaint against these kinds of serials. Some may say it’s funny and just for entertainment purposes but some may believe everything they show on TV is real and is applicable in real life."
"Thank you for providing such a insightful perspective on feminism. Your rational approach and thorough explanation really shed light on the complexities of the topic. It's refreshing to see someone tackle such an important issue with nuance and clarity. Keep up the great work. ❤
Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰"
No harm but in Islam women condition is worse  Hinduism me bhi hai but kam hai
"This video is a greatest informative video.


I proudly say that I am feminist

"Women empowerment also form of feminism in which men are not getting jobs. Most customer care, HRs and reception are women just to decorate office no proper work knowledge. Women working for a boss than investing time with Husband and family and raising children. Babysitting is a job now."
Ek aurat hi aurat ki dushman hai 🙂
Real Islam gives more rights to women than anything else.
Allah doesn't create male and female to compete each other but to complete each other.
"Boys can cry is not something that I can agree with . This can happen around ur closest friends and that's it ... If guys just let out they just loosen up and i don't feel like it's good , somehow I feel like all that suppression of stuff has always been my energy to move forward... 
But i do agree every single individual might not be the same . I hope everyone finds there on way ..."

Responsibility should be equal 😢
"For people asking why we need feminism:-
I’m not allowed to go out and work. 
Stalkers creeps starers everywhere.
Even if I am, Picking a profession will be surrounded by narratives like “that’s a man’s job “
If I get raped by my husband, no action can be taken 
The chances of getting raped if I go out alone at night is extremely high and 100% in certain places. 
I have to obey my husband, no opinions from my side
I have to take my husband’s last name. Loss of identity 
I have to leave my house and live at his.
I should suddenly detach from my parents and accept his parents as my own
Zero social life after marriage meanwhile husband gets to go out with his friends in the name of office obligations
Can’t wear what I want 
If I get raped (which I have) it’s my fault. I can never forget the looks I received from the police constable while asking me the details of my rape. Parents withdrew the complaint because the rapist was my relative and they wanted to protect his reputation. Mine’s gone though. I’m the one who’s raped but I’m suffering way more than him. My parents are so ashamed of having me."
"Just.......😊

"Most people confuse feminism with matriarchy. Good thing you defined it for some women and some men.
And i do understand that well behaved is good but not being too low in self respect.
Most women are patriarchial because half of the women are illiterate."

"ACTIONS SPEAKS LOUDER THAN WORDS. 
Laura bates is a complete misandrist(with fake mask of equality.) 
She always attack men and treat them as problem of society. 
Infact she attacks someone who raises his voice against the misandry she carries in name of feminism. 
""Their is pure qoutas and affirmations bais against men in UK and USA universities, and she always represses it and states its all fine(where men are lacking equal opportunities compared to women), the reserve of which was misogynistic but now isn't that misandrous""?? 
Pure hypocrite."

Thanks sir"
"i have heard about Dhruv Rathee a lot, but this was my first time watching his videos.  i am amazed by your efforts sir."
"Bc feminist do type ki hoti h ek acchi feminist or dusri pseudo jo bahut bekar cheez h but tere video dekhne aati isliye tu unki baat nahi kiya, vo tere video dekhne aati kyoki vo Palestine and lgbt supporter hoti jyadatar jo bjp se hatekrti h"
I would suggest Dhurv Rathee to study Contents from Dhravidar Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu a movement by EVR Periyar. These things will be more simplified and understood by general public in Tamil Nadu by Periyar's teachings
"I am in the side of girls(I'm a man). Women have been suppressed for many years. They should not be suppressed. But their is something else. The true meaning of feminism should not be applied to the society. I am against that.

In the 1st sight someone would think that I'm a patriatic but that's not the case.

Women are different than men. They are beautiful in their own way. They should not be compared or have same rights as men. If you say that men can walk on streets without a shirt then women should also be able to do so-It can't be done. Women can't do equal work like men.


Women should have equal rights but in some cases. They can't be provided with same equal rights for getting job(as men can do much better physical works quicker than them), but women should able to free and independent (kinda), and many other cases"
Good thought

"Hi Dhruv
I have watched some of your videos in which the level of research is extraordinary. But my request is , please keep looking for informations or statistics from south India too.
Especially when you are talking about feminism our eminent leader E.V. Ramasamy alias Periyar's  idealogy is inevitable.

"The problem is not with ""equality"",the problem is with this statement which say ""what men can do women can do better"" which hurts a lot.And  there are feminists  females who have started thinking this way which is effecting our community.Not every one but they are in minor groups and they are trying to increase it by showing how everything a woman does is way better than a man does it."
"Well said. My classmates are just like the chapris he pointed out in the video. They mock women for the lamest of reasons. On the other hand, if a guy does something stupid, nobody bats an eye (ofc, they are made fun of, but not based on their gender). The fact is that misogyny is ingrained in the depths of their brains thanks to the constant portrayal of 'alpha male/Sigma' content across all social media platforms and the everlasting ""ghareeli bahu"" ideology."
"9:03 being a medical student I can never agree with you in the medical concepts that you applied here. Liver, heart brain these vital organs averaging 200g, 400g and 400gms more in male emphasizing the difference in core metabolism between them. Similar but not the same."
I agree but female backho ko apne pet me 9 Month rakte hai Mard nahi es leye mere kheyal se women ko Mardo ke thara Zena nahi chiyea eska matlab glat mat nekalna 😂OK.. just Think About 1:1 🤔
"The films and shows that the mainstream general audience associates with feminism like 4 more shots, Thank You for Coming, Jee Karda, Veere di Wedding are not actually feminist. It is just baseless pop feminism. 

Real feminist works like Astitva, Angry Indian Goddesses, Women Talking, The Handmaid’s Tale actually challenge the audience to identify themselves as the part of the problem and shows a path to solutions."
"We will need feminism as long as unfair and rigid gender structures, stereotypes and expectations still exist. This applies to men, women and every person who identifies outside this binary"

You just cleared my mind. Thanks brother
but now the concept of feminism is different among women. they try to be superior than men. which is making a compition between men and women. what is your thaught on that?
"एक स्त्री कभी पैदा नहीं होती, उसे स्त्री बनाता है ये समाज और यही बात पुरूषों के लिए भी देखने को मिलती हैं। बचपन से ही हमें दायरों में रहना सिखा दिया जाता है। वरना रोने की क्षमता महिलाओं में भी होती है और पुरूषों में भी, किंतु हमारे समाज की सोच इसी नजरिए को लेकर विकसित हो चुकी है कि रोना सिर्फ लड़कियों का काम है, मर्दों का नहीं। हमारे समाज में शुरुआत से ही पुरुषों को अपनी संवेदनाओं को दबाएं रखने केलिए मजबूर किया जाता है जिससे उनकी प्रवृति आक्रामक भी होती जाती है। क्षमताएं  (महिलाओं व पुरुषों) दोनों में ही विद्यमान होती है किंतु यह समाज इन क्षमताओं में भेद पैदा करता है। रोने की क्षमता दोनों में होती है, आर्थिक स्थिति को संभालने की क्षमता भी दोनों में होती हैं, किंतु समाज ने ही इन क्षमताओं को लेकर भेद उत्पन्न किए हैं।"

"I am not against equal rights..but whats happening around the globe in the name of feminism and women rights ? Capitalism wants women to work and leave households..but is it efficient for the society as a whole? Just like not everyone needs to get married, there is no need for everyone to run after career.. Priorities are the answer.. There are more social factors and equations that need to be addressed.. I believe such an intelligent guy like Dhruv Rathee will someday see the glitches in the matrix regarding this matter."

Mother's is a great role.
Dhruve Bhai Apne Apne vlogs me kaha tha k Jaha India me illiteracy zyada he Waha or aurtien bachy peda krti hn, ya zyada krti hn, dhruve no double you are a man of information, me phle apko man of knowledge smjti thi.
Apk khud k pas Information bht he or Apne viewers ko b deliver krty, good job, but ap Yahan Apni research me pakdy gaye.
Agr bachay peda krna ya zyada bachay peda krna(aik hi baat he) illiteracy se belong he to what about the females who are scientists doctors have more than 2 kids.
My m-phil processor has 5 kids, we are five and well educated.
Bhai bacha aik peda karo ya das agr parents aik hi peda kry pr usk childhood se le kr young hood tak uski koi responsibility ni uthaty to wo society k lyi aik toxic he."
"I don't need to be a mother, or housewife to be accepted in my family, I think each gender has a specific role in our society, if my husband earns for me it is my responsibility to take care of my kids to feed them to wash my husband clothes, it is honor to me if I responsibly give him breakfast, lunch, dinner and whenever he wants.
Look, if an air hostess, a waitress serves the customer without any irresponsibility, why not a husband or father who fulfills our desires and gives us a roof, gives us the luxury of life, so if I decide to do the same job as my husband does, it would be difficult for me to do laborious job and settle family as well. It is worth full for me being a woman to take care of my husband and my instead of taking financial responsibility.
If husband and wife both go for work, and they hire a baby sitter, what if a female baby sitter has such a husband who do don't allow her to share financial responsibility and just sit at home and take care of his kids, after all she is feeding and taking care of others kids and they are paying certainly amount to her within which she has to limit her needs, on the hand it would be grateful to her to take care her own kids and husband, and she is not bound to her husband to give her pre decided amount or salary because she is not his servant afternoon all, the husband must fulfill her and his kids needs, this is totally beautiful patriarchy system under which a woman is not like air hostess, waitress or a baby sitter who need to obey all the time her boss, if she is off duty and salary would be definitely cut out. 
What's wrong with of a woman is well educated and take care of her family.
Our Society and our general need parents to be responsible for their roles. 
Oh, if someone says, why not a  male can take care of family, I swear it wouldn't be easy for them to do so, because everyone man is not earning by having Good job, someone feed their kids and family by loading heavy goods and machinery, can a woman do the same as they do.
So every gander has a specific role, that our society need to understand.
Every woman is not a doctor, teacher, engineer or scientist.
So woman is generally responsible for her family.
Man also has responsible to take care of his family, like earning, grocery, feeding his kids whenever his wife is busy, but he is not as worthy as woman by nature."
Being a true feminist means knowing that patriarchal mindsets cause challenges for both men and women.
Respect this man ❤

Ambedkar ne ladkiyo ke rights ke liye jo jo kiya uske upar ek video Banao
"کیا کوئی ""فیمنسٹ تحریک"" عورت کو اس کے حقوق دلوا سکتی ہے؟ 

کوئی زیادہ پرانی بات نہیں،
 صرف چودہ سو سال پہلے دنیا کی انسانی آبادیوں میں بھی جنگل یعنی طاقت کا قانون چلتا تھا. تقریباً ایک لاکھ چوبیس ہزار پیغمبر بنی آدم علیہ السلام کو اللہ کا پیغام زبانی و تحریری ہر دو صورت میں دے کر جا چکے تھے لیکن حضرت انسان کو اللہ  کا دین و قانون سمجھ نہ آیا تھا.
بیت اللہ کا طواف کرتے مگر برہنہ، عورتیں رکھتے مگر بنا نکاح (لونڈی)، کمزور کی معاشرے میں جگہ تھی مگر غلام، لڑکیوں کو بھی دفنایا تو جاتا تھا مگر پیدا ہوتے ہی زندہ، وغیرہ وغیرہ.
اور پھر خاتم النبیین تشریف لائے، اللہ کا پیغام دیا اور صرف تیرہ سال کے قلیل عرصہ میں دنیا کا نقشہ بدل گیا. قرآن مجید نازل ہوا جس میں اللہ تعالیٰ نے بنی آدم سے خود مخاطب ہو کر فرمایا کہ یہ کتاب اور نبی کی زندگی تمہارے لئیے مشعلِ راہ ہے، میں نے تمہیں اشرف المخلوقات بنایا، چاہتا ہوں کہ تم اپنی زندگیاں میری مرضی سے گزارو، اسی میں تمہارے لئیے نجات و فلاح ہے.
بنی آدم میں رشتے وضع کر دئیے گئے، ہر حیثیت سے حقوق و فرائض بتا دئیے گئے اور ان کے استحصال کو حرام و قابل گرفت قرار دے دیا گیا.
تمام فرق مٹ گئے، فوقیتیں ختم ہوگئیں، بتا دیا گیا کہ تم میں سے بہتر وہ ہے جو زیادہ متقی و پرہیز گار ہو گا، واضح کر دیا گیا کہ عربی کو عجمی پر، گورے کو کالے پر، امیر کو غریب پر اور مرد کو عورت پر کوئی فوقیت نہیں.
ساتھ ہی یہ بھی بتا دیا گیا کہ خاندانی و عائلی نظام جو اسلامی معاشرے کی اساس اور خوبصورتی ہے کو بہترین انداز میں چلانے کے لئیے صنفی تفرق سے بالاتر ہو کر صرف اور صرف احترام، احساس، ذمہ داری، حقوق و فرائض کی بنیاد پر جو مقام تفویض کئیے گئے ہیں ان کے حفظِ مراتب کا خیال رکھنا ورنہ نہ صرف اس کا شیرازہ بکھر جائے گا بلکہ اللہ کے ہاں جوابدہی و سزا کا سامنا بھی کرنا پڑے گا.
جہاں بچوں کو بڑوں، اولاد کو والدین اور بیوی کو شوہر کی اطاعت، فرمانبرداری اور احترام کا حکم دیا گیا وہیں بڑوں کو بچوں، والدین کو اولاد اور شوہر کو بیوی کے ساتھ شفقت، حسن سلوک اور محبت کا حکم بھی دیا گیا.
زمانہ گواہ ہے کہ جب تک ہمارے معاشرے میں اللہ کی کتاب اور نبی کی زندگی کو مشعل راہ سمجھا گیا حقوق و فرائض میں نہ تو کبھی کوئی ابہام پیدا ہوا اور نہ جھگڑا. 
یہ مسئلہ صرف ان معاشروں میں تھا جہاں انسانوں نے خود اپنی سمجھ بوجھ کے مطابق حقوق، فرائض اور حفظ مراتب طے کرنے کی کوشش کی.
خالقِ کل کائنات سے بہتر کوئی بھی ہمارے جذبات، احساسات، خواہشات، مسائل اور ضروریات کو جان اور سمجھ ہی نہیں سکتا، اسی لئیے اس طرح کی تمام کوششیں اور تجربات نہ صرف بری طرح ناکام ہوئے بلکہ اگر ان معاشروں کا بغور جائزہ لیا جائے تو وہاں پر مرو نے ان حقوق، فرائض اور حفظ مراتب کی تقسیم کے نام پر بالکل ویسے ہی فائدہ اٹھایا جو بچوں کی ایک کہانی میں بندر نے دو بلیوں کے درمیان روٹی تقسیم کرتے ہوئے اٹھایا تھا اور عورت بیچاری صرف ایک نام نہاد برابری کی خواہش میں اپنی عزت، آبرو، مقام اور احترام سب کچھ گنوا بیٹھی.
بد قسمتی یہ ہے کہ آج انہی معاشروں سے متاثر چند مغرب زدہ اور بیمار ذہن خواتین و مردوں نے ہمارے معاشرے میں کچھ جہلا کے ہاتھوں ہونے والے انفرادی اقدامات کو بنیاد بنا کر اور اجتماعی رنگ دے کر ہماری سادہ لوح خواتین اور مردوں کو ورغلا رکھا ہے جس کا مقصد صرف اور صرف ان کو استعمال کرتے ہوئے اپنی دکان چمکا کر سستی شہرت اور چند ٹکے حاصل کرنا ہے.
سچ تو یہ ہے کہ عورت کو حقوق دلوانے کے لئیے ہمارے معاشرے میں کسی نام نہاد ""فیمنسٹ تحریک"" کی نہیں بلکہ اللہ کی کتاب اور نبی کی زندگی کو پھر سے مشعل راہ بنانے کی ضرورت ہے کیونکہ خالقِ کل کائنات سے بہتر نہ تو کوئی ہمارے جذبات، احساسات، خواہشات، ضروریات و مسائل جانتا اور سمجھتا ہے اور نہ ہی کوئی ان کو سامنے رکھ کر مکمل غیر جانبداری سے اصول و ضوابط وضع کر سکتا ہے.
مجھ ناچیز کو یقین واثق ہے کہ اگر ہم آج اس چودہ سو سال پہلے سے روز روشن کی طرح عیاں حقیقت کو تسلیم کر لیں تو اگلے سال یا آئندہ کسی بھی سال کسی نام نہاد ""تحریک"" کی ضرورت کبھی بھی نہیں پڑے گی.

Feminism aur Patriarchy par Mujhe 'Seeken Jigyasa' ki video jyada detailed lgi Jo male aur female ke innate biological aur psychological traits ki bhi baat krta hai.
But what equal right should they get in todays society women get every right of men

Fun fact is I am hearing the word matriarchy for the first time shows how much men dominated our world is
Bruh you made such a good clarification ❤
Mens are most vulnerable in the society from within 😔

"It's a good video, but i disagree with one point, like you called the women who are patriarchal as regressive but i feel a women has the choice to either be patriarchal or be a boss babe working hard for a career, thats what i believe real feminism is: Giving women the freedom to choose what they want to be and calling a choice regressive or radical is wrong (i might be wrong, so please correct me if so)"
Discrimination of any sort is wrong. People need to understand this.

Again thank you sir
Mad respect bro
"Matriarchy is also a widespread problem like patriarchy. Matriarchy  WAS NOT addressed well enough in this video.

 I came across a video where a woman says ""women dont need men anymore because theres a recent scientific study conducted proving that women can impregnate themselves just by using bone marrow and that the resulting baby will be a female""j"
"The height thing is too real. There were many studies done on it and it was found out that women consistently find taller men more attractive. But im not very sure about the reason. The data showed too much consistency, so does it signify that patriarchal views are so much prevalent in all countries?? Can it be because women are biologically more attracted to taller men even when they arent in contact with patriarchal views?"
beside everything my car is way too important for me
If those who are feminists understand this is not a feminist film.Then those who understand reality should not do the scenes shown in Kabir Singh and Animal in reality.Then why you make vedio on all these films.

"A family of 4 members. Father, Mother, Sister and a Brother. They belong  middle class family. Parents working hard for their childrens bright future. Father worked in a company salary:30k . The Girl and the boy complete their study. And now they both are able to do some jobs . The girl got a job salary:15k . But the boy didn't. If the girl supports feminisms. There in her mind one word came now she is something. She earns 15k per month . Then the dangerous action taken by her . She started disrespect her elder brother. Brother who loves his sister soo much. Always support his sister. And now this happened only for feminism . Because of she has a job and feminisms in her mind . If she go out from home with her friends for party or traveling. If her father don't allow to go . Then she forgot that he is her father. She directly said now I am an indipendent girl. Soo don't teach me what to do or what not to do . Here she started disrespect her father. Father,who sacrifice everything for this girl . This is soo harmful for our sisters. Pls bro dhruvrathee think again about it . After that make a video for it . Say this faminism girl and women Don't disrespect Father, Brother, uncle, husband etc ."
If a girl or woman get's equal rights. After then she lost to respect her own Father and brother and also uncle. It's true . You think it and you get your own answer.

who is the speaker at 9:48? I want to listen to her speeches.
"Dhruv, genders are not equal from a scientific point of view. Our developmental path is not same. Our physical ability is different. Our hormonal systems are not same. That is a biological fact. Our emotional needs are also different. There are quite a lot of scientific studies that point to women have different preferences and behavioural patterns that are not followed by men and vice versa. So if we start forcing people and their choices based on gender we are walking the wrong path. I will talk about individual choice in this context. What humanity needs is the respect for individual choice.   
But we can work for equal rights for both genders under law and policy.  Indeed, woman can work jobs, fend for their family and be equally contributory to society. The question of feminism is about equality under law, not forcing narratives like patriarchy. It is about every girl finding out for herself what is right for her and what role model she want to follow. Often they look at their mother and their experiences. The problem with 4th way feminism currently underway is that it has become toxic. It is a politicised movement in the west that has grown into become labelled as ""woke"" where you get to see LGBTQ+ men suddently declaring themselves as women and participate in womens sport. Suddenly these substandard athletes become the top grade. That is intellectual dishonesty. This woke movement is an agenda of the Elisitst Corporates of the west, who wanted to take advantage of the Cheap labour that women provided. 

The problem is here that a very complex topic is again presented  with lopsided statements such as mens issues can be handled by feminism. No it is because men are human beings  and we psychological distinct from woman. Stating anything else is a lie not a scientific fact. There are natural outlets for boys to vent out their emotions when growing up.That involves some rough play also. Why do you think gladiatorial sports like MMA and boxing enjoy so much popularity?  Why do you think that most popular sports amoung men are often phyiscally intensive in nature. That women sports have a fraction of the viewership of mens sport? 

In the name of patriarchy most men's issues are being politicised and painted a dark color. Isnt interesting that it is the women often talking about mens violence and issues. Why are men not being consulted? Why are men not talking about their issues. It is because we talk about it amoung men. You tube is full of content channel that talk about these issues and their audience and participation is heavily leans on men. This is because men/boys have greater propensity to men(Actors, Sportsmen, male Polticial leaders) as role models. The attempt to form groups and gangs by boys with only men in that is not abnormal. There are several scientific studies showing the need for boys and men to have peer groups and the benefits of that.

Since when did the word masculine has become associated with the word ""Toxic"". Everytime that word is taken up in the media it is associated with toxicity as if men and their natural state is violent, misogynist, self indulgent and irresponsible individuals. Sad state is that a large number of boys when they grow up get through a rebellious phase where they exhibit some of these traits for social acceptance or identity  establishment. Alpha male is a reality. Not a ""Toxic"" aboimination. Please spend some time researching the evolution of the species and the role of the Alpha male especially amoung our direct ancestors.  And the best antidote is not feminism but good father figures who are present in their lives. Help them find their own identity. Become examples for them. Mothers are important too, but for this need a father is the role model.
 
Meanwhile we all have Fathers at home.  Many can attest how they quietly take on the world, work hard,  particiapate in the well being of the family unit. Often they play an important role out in the society, spending time away from family. That often they go through the same emotional problems of stress and expectations but take on those challenges for the love of their family.  How they love their children irrespective of gender. How they are the most effected in case of divorce since they have no natural rights to child custody as women enjoy. That there is huge problem where woman in the west especially are abusing that right to cheat a There are several TED talks too about the same.

Yet the feminist almost always zooms on the few toxic  inidividual who are failed fathers. One major index to look at the number of talk shows and programmes focusing on feminism and the rights of woman. Why is age old institution like family is often pictured in a unfavourable light in the media? 

Another point to look at is the state of decline in the West and there are now big debate going on the influence of 3rd way feminism in destroying the family fabric. Over 50% of African American families are now single parent with mother in custody. And the most problem group of errant boys/men are from that group. Lawlessness, crime, drugs have overtaken most black neighbourhoods. Social scientist are talking now about how 3rd wave feminism has misguided a generation of women and men. How Liberal Socialism have created the decline of Black America"

@dhruvrathee y im getting ad of bjp ads on u r video 😮
My opinion .... Its not easy for either men or women in this world  and its getting harder for children coz they have to grow up to the men and women of tomorrow and there are privilege for both men and women and most of the privilege are being abused and this has to be fixed not as a community but by every individual and the community is supposed to show the direction....fake it or be it .....just make it.
According to me I don't think it's important to work out side the house to be equal... I mean it depends wht the couple decides .. to work out a family one has to take care of his/her kids. It doesn't mean it always has to be a woman. Earlier times in India we had women to play both the roles at some families women were working outside to earn and some took care of the kids and their husbands earned. But after the invaders arrived women were advised to switch their roles to stay at home. And then it continued and became a compulsion.

"Good of you to make this video, patriarchy and feminism are all social concepts, it is very dependent on ones own intellect what they take from it and from this video.

Men or women both are “human” first and all human rights are their rights. Both men and women have education and ambitions  .

great video
"the simple fact is being a man is a privilege... in India as a 20 year old being a woman is living in constant paranoia, and fear of men checking you up and down or that of being abducted and raped, and the society being quick to blame us for anything and everything while for men instead of calling them uncivilised, ""boys will be boys, they are adventurous and violent due to raging hormones""
can we all just feel safe? we talk a lot about feminism but the root cause of all problems lie in the mentality of people, the vicious trio of the govt+police+media which can frame anything however they want to and all deserve to be arrested under our constitution, we are run by criminals, thats the problem, a country run by people with criminal mentality and no sense of justice will have crime in it
Bollywood also has a lot to do with why men feel entitled to sexual violence and how they view women as nothing but sex toys
As human beinga we all must dress modest but forcing not to and slutshaming women for wearing jeans and a top is just normalising and justifying rape culture whichis SO WRONG"
100% true

"I have watched a lot of dhruv and now I understand why people call him that he only highlights things to support his point of view, he very easily potrayed that the way the society is built is wrong but didn't emphasize on why the society today is this way, there is for sure a lot of problems in the society we live in but he did not take into consideration the biological and political factors that have influenced and shaped the things the way they are, there are a lot of things that could have been highlighted about the issue, I won't be mentioning the points as people already do know what I am trying to say, Thank you for your time...."
finally someone spoke the truth!!!
11:13  I was thinking about myself 😂😂
"Bro, if men and women both are equal, then why there are some rights given to women that makes inequality, rights like 50% low price of tickets in buses, etc."
"i really enjoy the moment when you say ""yeh chapri gang"" 🤣🤣🤣 it feels very funny when pronounced like your accent"
Notice how even after the video talks about how feminism isn't something bad but something important for both men and woman and still some brainless people are fighting against women in the comments. Also the fact that they only put replies to comments by talking sh*t and insulting women instead of bringing in facts.
Much respect for this man❤❤

On the second hand , I saw videos of period pain simulator, where men cry in pain but women don't even feel pain . On those comment sections, no woman makes fun of men !!"
Another thing is patriarchy is responsible for so many young m3n and boys being k1lled in wars. Suppressing emotions in m3n causes m3n to burst out in other ways. Most of the v10lent crimes are commited by m3n and most of the victims are other m3n.

"To simplify it is just that word feminism since is derived from Feminine, it is just perceived that meaning is same as matriarchy. .. No one has time like Dhruv to read the dictionary and make such detailed video. It is best that we use the words gender equality. Feminism in most heads is just women over men."

Now you guys are free to call me andbhakt or whatever you are brainwashed to say, because of such videos, i feel doubt while watching some of his good videos as well."

Please make a video on your daily life😊
"The internet has given stupid people like me a platform to raise their voice and it hurts all the sensible people too.
Man you have courage to make a video on this explosive topic. I concur with most of what you say and I am against women bashing ""studs"" but one thing that needs to be addressed is legislation and proper, timely execution of the said legislation. The horrible things that women are subjected to make us feel that laws need to be more stringent while ironically the present laws sometimes leave men defenseless and are abused to hell by some people(which is natural as lawyers' intention is to win a case) which in turn could be a factor in making many young men harbour patriarchal thoughts and avoid women altogether which can't be good for a healthy society. It hurts careers of both women and men."
Greta video you really talked about feminism in a descriptive manner 👏👏
Each and every word in this video has just won my heart ❤ U r really a good man along with good IQ Dhruv. GBU
What is the meaning of equal right..
We are not against Men..we are against MENtality.
"* Mentions that he was called out for criticizing Animal but not other pro-women movies *

* Still doesn't do it *

The comments were about YOU, my guy. Yes, the writers might've criticized those movies but the point is that YOU didn’t.

You present a lot of good points throughout the video but the fact that you have an inherent bias and aren't willing to admit it; that ticks me off."

I couldn't agree more. You are absolutely right.

"He is completely devoid of ground understanding on why people are talking about toxic feminism. During start of video, he tried to portray their are also mentioned who throw acid on women. Toxic feminism is not recognising that there are girls too who throw acid on men for not agreeing. At the extreme several feminist do not even consider this a case fit for discussion, on the contrary some feminist celebrate it as pay back for ""years of oppression"". There are several similar incidences. The people who actually see things around are aware of these things. One may give zillion of argument, but literally the toxic version of feminism has made entire society divided on gender and taught society to doubt individual on basis of their gender and this includes even mentioned doubting the women of their intention."

Read Ancient Sanatan Dharma first.  You didn't give any example from Islam how patriarchal it is. Infact the condition of Muslim females is worse but you won't give their examples coz you're paid Dhruv
Respect for you

"You are absolutely right, everyone deserves their equal rights, they may be men, women and transender too. But what about the equal punishment given to same crime done by men and women. Women never punished by Indian law for same crime as men done the same. The equality must be exists in law also. it's my humble request please make a vedio on Indian's law of women. Does crime has zender? You told that as per NCR data men suicide rate are more then women. This is the biggest reason that evoke men to suicide due to one sided Indian law for women ."

What about kinner or bisexual

"Video is good, but if any Muslim wants to know women rights in islam ill prefer to watch ""women rights in islam by zakir naik"". Specialy for men and not only for muslim for everybody. Islam is not only for Muslim. It is for whole mankind."
"I agree with you. If not 100% maybe 50%+. But when you said religion. Most of people will think of Islam. So i want to say that islam don't say that every woman should do hijab, but they should do who are muslim. And its compolsary for a man to loweer there gaze. And as a muslim we believe that the jannah is under our mother's feet. And its sunnah to feed your wife food with your hand. But there's some things what not allowed for women (Muslim)."

"Feminism was good, but today I see no rights that men have over women(not talking about third world countries). I personally have no problem with feminism, and women should have equal rights. But  the thing that triggers me is that modern day feminists talk sh!t that they dont need men, or all men are rap!st. In my opinion, neither of us can live without each other, and toxic feminists are ruining the society. Another thing hat should be changed is that the unfair discrimination no one talks about. A woman slaps a man, ""wow she is so bold and brave"". Man does the sane thing, ""coward, rap!st, misogynist"". A wise man once said, ""equal rights, equal lefts"""
I imagine a girl
That's the reason BJP-RSS wants to make India a Hinduratsra because it contains hallmarks of patriarchy and Hindutrastra is not only detrimental for Dalit-adivasi and minorities but for women and ordinary citizens too. Let's pledge for a free India and vote this BJP out of the system to save democracy which gave every citizen equal rights
Everything is a about time and experiences .....but we should focus on becoming a good human to every living being apart from their gender and species and i still can't understand logo ne 10th class ki civics ki book nahi padhi thi kya jo feminism ka matalab na pata ho seriously 😿
Hey anyone who is feminist please answer my question teaching only girl how to do house hold works cooking cleaning etc is right ? Till today even after working all day in office reaching home a women still does does household work is that right becz idk
Pls make a video on transgender
3:27 i love chris ❤
So we should build another country for only woman altogether and enjoy the rest of our lives with fast cars on the road without having silly accidents???
Mostly famenist woman didn't even know the meaning of famenist 😂

Very important Video for this generation 🤝
beautiful video❤
Is there any feminist who supported the boy who was hit by that girl in the road... As shown in the last of video..
This channel has the best content to watch 😊
How is Dhruv Rathee an expert on Feminism? just because he has million + subscription does not make him an expert on every thing.
It's true woman will never prefer to marry a man who is unemployed. I have never seen such case where girl has married unemployed man.
Feminism has been destroying society wth. you mean that girl should convert into boys and behave like a boy too? Get ur brain surgery done
And what about men struggle
"When you go to Mizoram, you will find matriarchal society. In Kerala, there are places where wealth is transfered to daughters.

After Mahabahrath, matriarchal ended up... which had been existing till then. 

It's again a transition period of going back to matriachy, for sure."
Thanks bhaiii.... rukna nhi.....or plz apna dhyna rkhna😊
I love this man extremely
Onpy Respect and Support to you brother 🙌🏻
I can't believe someone expressing my thoughts so precisely.
Male and female are created in the image of God.  Both are of the same essence-humanity.
this is a manipulative video with baseless on why patriarchal system was introduced.
"Thank you Sir for talking about this in such a simple and intelligent way!

I really wish that the day comes soon, when girls and boys will be walking on the roads and going anywhere they want to without the fear of each other's opinions."

"Video is very educational.... Dhruv sir. ,🙏🙏
This should be taught to both men and women.
But apne sirf problem discuss Kiya hai ...solution nahi bataya.

And a question arises after watching the video ki...kya Feminist world me aise Emotionally, financially and physically weak Men acceptable hai.
Centuries have passed but this  had never happened.
For this a survey should be conducted....
Those who can accept can like 👍 and others can dislike."
Thank you Dhruv😊

"there should be paternity leaves too , fathers need to bond with children and women are weak at that time so they get a helping hand , post partum depression is also a common thing , hence every father should get some paid leaves so that at those special moments they can be with their children with a free mind. Being a father is as special as being a mother."

"I don't think people are intentionally doing this, most of the people are doing this because they are confused to understand this word ""Feminism"""
"One side our epic books shows different statement about patriarchy, to be more specific..it's all about how female characters are bound to follow their culture and  accept all customs to live as virtuous women between society.

Time changed too much, it's not like you will follow all those words which is written on there! Living in present by being true human, you don't need to learn things from different places but you just need to understand by exchanging your position between opposite character."
Feminism k real mtlb ko clear kr do AP aik separate choti se video me
Most useless video
"I am a Muslim and I do not believe in feminism or anything else.  Because in this era, girls are becoming more uneducated than educated.  They think that the world is only theirs.  Islam has the rights of girls, they need to be cared for and loved.  But they want to get out.  I am replying to 2 questions of your video.  If the girls stayed at home then no one could understand whether her husband is tall or short.  And even though Islam has given women a lot of support, they don't want to accept it.  Feminism is not good or bad, we want our mothers, sisters, wives to stay at home and not be noticed"
Dhruv I'm not your hater but there is some points where I don't agree with you can we talk
"Jb sir ne bola ek berojgar admi ko imagine kariye .

"Hello im a 14-15 years old 10th standard student and i am learning a lot of things from dhruv rathee, he is making me mature or making the Indian youth mature.I am really  happy to see this that if world have bad people it also have mature and good people like him.
And yeah i am lonely he's absolutely right about men's loneliness"
We have to save this man at any cost... Love your videos and how unbiased it is❤
ahilaya bai holkar also played important role in education and political rights for women and even supporting men in a positive way
changed my view on feminism
"Sir,thanks for  giving us these valuable imformation."
"Thanks Dhruv! 

We need more men & women who believe in equality & not we vs them. 

You don't need to be same to be equal.

"But you know what is the real point? In our modern generation, most of the so called feminist women doesn't even know what is the real feminism is. And that's so pathetic 🙂"
"You missed one point. You kept mentioning and explaining ""asli"" feminism in most of the video. Most people don't have a problem with that ""asli"" feminism. And you missed that the ""asli"" feminism you keep talking about is in the back. When you see an average feminist, she is not influenced from that ""asli' feminism rather she's influenced by toxic feminism. And the way you kept generalising all anti-feminism men, ""chapri alpha male"" is clear bias. This is hypocrisy from your side. If you look at it, most of the feminists are chapri ""girl power"" females too.
This whole anti-feminism thing was a reaction, as for it be anti something, that something has to exist first. And that something is those ""chapri girl power"" feminists which you failed to show, are the majority. Also, you failed to honestly deliver the differences between men and women. Not everything is the fault of patriarchy. If men are more emotionally resilient (biologically proven btw) and physically stronger (also biologically proven) then it would of course be natural that shouldn't cry as much as women and while it is bad, a part of men's nature IS to fight. It is only sensible that men get into more fights. As I said, you portrayed it as patriarchy's fault while it is nature. Patriarchy didn't form itself. It formed because it aligns with nature. Of course you shouldn't shame a man for crying or not engaging in fights, but doing the extreme opposite of this is actually wrong too."
"i think its more about the image that society is created of a women rather than it having a cultural or religious impact. people give an excuse of it being religiously incorrect for a women to do certain things when it is totally opposite. people don't even know what their religion or culture has to offer and still label it as ""culturally accurate"" because as far as ive learnt and my elders have always taught me is how beautifully our religion has always respected women and provided them with equal rights infact pray women and never restrict them or force them to not focus on their career and marry at a young age or wear a certain piece of clothing ."
"Agree to your vedio brother, but now a days the definition of feminism in India is changing in real life."
Puri Hindi bola kro plzzz❤
I have a conflict between my sister anout the need of men in this world and she said that she don't need men .......but she says that she is femenist
"There is a wave of anti-toxic feminist movement in the developed world but we are moving towards this toxic ideology. They seen how this ideology destroyed the families, Mothers are now realising that they spent so much of their precious time working for others instead of spending time with their precious children, they have let the others indoctrinate their children."
"Why don't you show the data where the feminist socity are more depressed and have more devorce rates, a divorced women would have to work more to raise her children and children would be without a father figure and most likely will indulge in criminal activities because of lack of parental love and care, study shows it. Femisits society  promotes cheating with their life partners(both male and female)."
Now a days Priyanka Chopra jonus is a brand ambassador of feminism.
"“Every action has its equal and opposite reactions”

- Women’s & children rights should be protected at any cost.
- Both Genders have their own duties and responsibilities as assigned by the nature and no one can change if we try to modify the principles of nature then the first thing that will be destroyed is Family culture and I believe that specifically the subcontinent is a place of Moral values, Cultural and religious values and I think it is a beauty of our land. There will be people who will never satisfy with my point but why I am saying this is because all these feminism, LGBTQ and bla bla is originating and coming out from WEST and if you look in to the cultural values of these nations are disastrously Corrupted No matter how much money they have or Who own GUCCI PRADA this and that…
- Males are designed to lead and provide the house and women’s are designed to nurture and upbringing of the children’s ( It does not means that she has to be treated as a maid that is why I mentioned that the rights should be protected under the state and law) and if she wants to do business or Work she is allowed to do but not on the price of her character, Chesty, Modesty which means WOMENS ORIENTED JOBS has to be created.
- Now if we talk about the EQUAL RIGHTS of women I totally agree with the point but the first thing that comes before equal right is WHAT ROLE ASSIGNED TO WHOM By the nature. Our Physical appearances, Thought Process, React/Response towards situations, Emotional stability, Mental strength, Dressing, Voices and many other examples indicates that both genders are different and has no comparison at all.

Lastly I would just remind all of my friends that Why we are following the footsteps of WEST and getting into stress, Love towards the worldly life and forget about the death, Cheating, Women Abuse, Drugs, Hopelessness, Depression, Anxiety  ect ect ect. İnstead of creating our own processes and inventions So many people from our subcontinent are leading the world in Technology, Sports, Innovations, Service Sectors.

In our time we are facing the arguments and practices of Feminism and no one knows how far it may lead the women to be treated in our society. 

“We respect women’s and protect their rights not on the cost of there Innocence “

============================
I support your content and there are videos and points where my view are different or opposite but specifically on the matters like this I want to advise you that dont make videos on such topics as it is a part of great game between good and bad, right and wrong, Evil and good.

I am recommending you a TV show that is based on true history just watch it and try to extract the essence of the show it will definitely gonna help you in your content creation with right concepts.

"Today's news
A grandson stabbed and killed the mother of his father for harassing and constantly berating his mother.
A woman is her enemy.
Such prejudices, traditions have played havoc with women's lives. Majority of the victims are women, irrespective of caste, class, creed or religion.
To dominate is a weakness and domination is an attempt to hide this weakness.
Women and  men should take equal responsibility in every sphere of human society, family organizations govt. And they should equal opportunity in every enabling activity like education.
They should be equally accountable for their actions 
But thousands of years of prejudices traditions take a long time to overcome
There is another most heinous prejudice i.e women's purity lies in virginity before marriage and should be faithful to the husband in marriage but man need not be so"

"I just listened to a male chauvinistic may be Russian English video and I started wondering do all men think like this bcoz ever since a child I've been feminist and after reading constitution and history made my affirmation absolutely clear that my thought process was not wrong. Anyways, saw your video immediately after that and I realized, not all men think like garbage and happy that indian men are actually a bit better. The western men are actually frustrated with women's promiscuity which equals those of men here and they turn a blind eye to their own similar behavior. This is actual hypocrisy. Both pillars of the society are getting porous from within and the value system based on religion promotes this hypocrisy to the best possible extent."

"Dhruv me kai chize bilkul sahi boli par as usual kai galat, befaltu manipulative bhi. Opportunity ni equality sabko milni chaiye. Or aaj kal ki feminist didiyo ko yahi bolna chaunga ki tum apna feminism rakhlo. Hume rone ke liye mat bolo hum ese he sahi hae. Ladko ko isliye rone se mana nahi kiya jata ki ladke nahi rote inke hisab se to ladko ki akho se kabhi asu aate he nahi matalab. Ladkiya or ladke emotionally, mentally or physically alag hote hae. Simple baat hae ise ghumake manipulative tarike se bola jai to woke he banega koi bhi"
I don't know why this happen in chats when it's about women
Comment section mae ab sab samajdaar banenge.  Tum kese bol sakte ho ki ladke ho roo do aram se. Ha agar kisi ko rona hae wo ro le kisi ne mana nahi kiya par ye hutiye ese hae jo har baat pe rone lagenge😂. Dhruv ne nina ko galat bol diya to wo galat nahi ho jati. Matlab wo bhi apni jagha sahi hae. Log sirf dusre ke opinion se he apna maan bana lete hae. Agar wo nina ne na bola hota or Priyanka ne bola hota to sab usi baat ko sach maan lete.

"Intentionally or unintentionally he missed so many points. Increasing number of false charges put on men by women, how women get away by making certain statements but men get in trouble, how all the divorce laws in our constitution are against men and are only meant to squeeze their pockets, how men face abuse in marriages. C'mon Dhruv, you're better than that!"
True men and women should be treated equally in every aspect

"But women expect their man to beat up the other guy, there s a reason the patriarchal mindset came"
Anyone who knows Islam knows that it’s the most feminist religion
Awesome explanation 💞
These ideas can be possible for uppar class which has financial freedom. But in typical India Patriarchy is saving lot of things and there is mutual respect also. So we don't need to take it from west.

"as u have said chapri ladke shows this unfortunate events as feminism, i have also seen, in the social media, where four more shots and neha dhupia comment was promoted  by females in the name of feminism and empowerment. so u have to show both sides"
"Damn!!! Many might have clicked on this video to get a dose of feminist bashing but might have instead got an education on gender rights, feminism and equality. Well done, Dhruv !!!!!"
"a fan of this channel but at 2:44 the statement that every rational person is a feminist is a big mistake. Its totally the opposite.
feminism claims that men and women are equal but actully they are different. They claim that men and women have equal rights  but in reality its imposible as women always refers to men to enforce their rights.  physical superiority of men is the sole reason of men dominance. There is no way around these facts, bitter but true and natural."
Indian ledkiya bohot bandmash hote hai
In our religion we are allowed to make 4 wives if we are capable to give them equal rights and maintain justice

"There are equal rights of women in islam  , but the prime responsibilty is to raise her children infact many of jobs and services should be consider for women only like gynecologist and sonologist and soo on , but as a whole all of this should be happen in hijab for the sake and modesty of society ...yes there is a hijsb of voice in islam so she has to try maximun harshly or rudely conversation with other males so they can not imagine any type of appeal in her.."
You should be the PM of India bro 🇮🇳
"In the face of nature we are nothing but mere creatures with higher intelligence than other species
And as the saying goes "" Nature is neither kind nor harsh, it`s just a truth we all must obey. It is a truth which is enforced by Gods on their children to make sure the children know that it doesn`t matter if you are strong or weak , clever or foolish , and a man or a woman , you will be punished by it`s judgement.
So, the least we can do is try to to make ourselves better and someone stronger so that we can prove that we are the ultimate creation of the rulers and origin of creation, the GODS itself"""

"Can you make a video on the fake rape claims women make for men? When men get in trouble for these lies they get life sentences, but when women get caught lying the only get a a few months of jail time or nothing sometimes. Is the judicial system the same for men and women??? Can men also get the same right in the eyes of the law. What happens to equal rights then??"

"A great exercise in obfuscation. Sticking to old dictionary definitions of the term or insisting on exclusion of behaviour or attitudes which their practitioners would certainly claim arise out of them being 'feminists' does not make for a sound case. This video's transcript would make for a good bland school essay. Nothing more. Savitribai Phule is in a very old boat. Call it by whatever name, but the concern of many men and women (including Margaret Atwood) is the constant scrutiny and nagging of every small act or gesture of men. Missing a sense of proportion when condemning men's behaviour. And a perennial wish to persecute. At present, it's an exercise to grab power, Mr. Rathee. Either you are blindsided by the new hegemony or you know it and continue with the wishful thinking that 'feminism' would confine itself to the definitions you presented.

Look at the laws, and the policies governments and other organisations keep coming up with. One example, if a minor girl's 'consent' is immaterial because she is not old enough then is it fair to burden the boys with sole responsibility? Of course, case of assault is different. Are all minor boys even taught that they would be solely persecuted for any intimacy with a girl? Line must be drawn a little before. 

Animal is a bullshit film and we need to protect boys from taking any lesson from such crap. At the same time, when you corner someone and hound them until they sing your song then people react irrationally. When you push them to be either with you or against you then you are forcing them to pick the latter.

Have you heard of the phenomenon called identity politics? Most 'feminists' are fond of certain category of statistics. These are a means to an end. The end is power. Some statistics that were absent from the recent NCRB crime data: rising cases of crime by women. Of course, some women committing crime is not any worse than some men commiting crime. However, the current discourse does not let one pay attention to that. 

As for 'patriarchy': Historically the scarcity and the challenge nature presented must have called for great efficiency in social arrangement. Given women's exclusive biological function of giving birth and the associated problems they face because of this it was quite efficient to make them look after the children and the house. Men don't face these biological challenges, hence, it makes more sense for them to be outdoors, be it fighting or working. Of course, this does not mean women should be excluded from decision making, but the truth is they are not. In the 'patriarchal' set-up ask any man who do they consult when deciding what dynamics to keep with other members in joint families. Furthermore, efforts can be made that allow women to overcome these challenges to do other work. This takes us to the next point of 'equality'.

What you are doing is comparing the apples to oranges. Boys from poor or rural families also don't have, and have never had, the opportunities to that middle and upper class boys do. Equality of opportunity is not going to make all occupy higher positions. Most women, like most men, will be another brick in the wall, be it at home or in the office. Equality has also brought us quite a number of women driving e-rickshaws in Delhi. Historically, a small number of men sat on high positions, like they do today, coveted by equally educated women. Their lie is that women will share it equally if most drive rickshaws, become domestic helps, overworked desk workers, etc and some occupy decision making positions."

"feminism is cancer! admit it or not, it is the truth!"
They say the meaning of feminism is equal rights for both genders but why are there no gender neutral laws when it comes to rape cases why are there reservation for women
There is a Akatsuki sign in samajdar aadmi’s mind
"currently modern world feminists are trying to destroy men life simple some toxic feminists take advantage of feminists right files rape case's on mens  for money or some personal issues destroyed mens life and currently their is new law for girls if girls bf isn't ready for marriage she files a rape case's against her bf lamo what f***k is this Too many men are literally dying in service to this grand feminist delusion.Women's lives are precious; but not so much we can and should justify sending men to hell en masse, as we are currently doing. Men's lives matter, too.
We need an awakening of consciousness, before unconscious democracy destroys the world.This sad but truth Men's lives are considered disposable, while women's lives are considered precious.Women's lives are precious; but not so much we can and should justify sending men to hell en masse, as we are currently doing. Men's lives matter, too.
We need an awakening of consciousness, before unconscious democracy destroys the world.and i accepted like you woman's men's also fight for their rights but don't you think currently women's law are too much leave it I don't want to take risks"

"एक आदमी और औरत को एक समाज मे equal rights होने पर भी वह कभी practically implement नही हो सकते । क्योंकि आदमी और औरत मे Natural mental difference  होता है,हम बस physically different नही होते । patriarchy समाज feminism समाज से मजबूत होगा बस वह औरतों के fundamental rights का खनन न करे। आज का हमारा social system जो है वही बहुत आच्छा है उपरोक्त दृष्टिकोण से।"

Men aur women's ko ek hadd tak barabar to nahi kar sakte hai hum q k both are different phisically lekin rights to milne chahiye dono ko. mere khayal hai ke dono ko ek dusre ki izzat karna chahiye. Q k insaaniyat dono ke milne ki wajah se hi chal rahi hai. Yeh topic bohot complicated hai aise to phir bhi sab ki apni apni soch hai.
Really insightful …

Very very informative video...👍👍 You analysis the topics very clearly... Often People don't like the word feminism.... actually some people don't understand the meaning of feminism.. actually they don't understand what a girl suffer.... Thnak u sir for ur beautiful explanation ❤❤🙏
"Finally someone said it!!!!!  🥹🥹. But I would like to defend Neena Gupta here, she meant that we are not equal…. We don’t need to be! But we are very much capable of making our own decisions and have rights and choices. 

Infact as a feminist I feel we need gender neutral laws(to avoid fake cases and unnecessary time consuming cases for the courts. Idhar actual cases ko justice milne mein itna time lag raha hai and ye log fake karre hai,)… we want equal treatment. Treat us with respect… and I do think it’s obvious? What is Gender? We are humans and therefore, equal"
"I believe just in equality. I don't know any caste , any religion ok any gender i just know  that we are all humans and God never discriminated us we did this ourself"
C hai  dhruv
"Ask any employed girl if she is ready to marry an unemployed boy or not? After that you can make such rubbish videos... I always believe that a man and woman are 100% equal in terms of  capabilities but in a country of such high unemployment and average age less than 30 ,it is better not to talk about woman's employment. I believe that the term woman empowerment is insulting for women as women are naturally empowered from within and no need to empower them from outside."
"Bhai tum sab bilkul theek keh rhe ho magar ye theoretical feminism h.

In reality, western culture is slowly being adopted in india. A western culture full of 'feminism' with high divorce rates, high rates of depression in both men and women as a result, loneliness crisis hookup culture (giving feminism as an excuse) etc."

"The whole story is trying to suppress our hormonal and biological characteristic, labeling them as toxic. This guy is trying to oversimplify the issue. It's because of feminism a regular guy gets thrown under the bus. The negative force feminism brings has impact on men's mental and physical health. 
A lot of things dhruv said is because of patriarchy but he forget that even more stronger factor is simply because of biology!"

"If u r a human u won't never ever criticize the rights of a person, regardless of its gender. And that's what FEMINISM is, ""Equal rights for every1"""
"Fake faminism is like cancer, which destroys the body; here, the body is women, and feminism is cancer on the second stage, only waiting to develop into the third stage, and it will destroy the female gender (no trust, faith, and even no value as a human). I have never seen a common woman who refers to herself as a feminist be considered to help an actual victim; they will only talk about ""my body, my choice,"" ""I can know what I like,"" this type of topic, which is meaningless. If you can't stand in pride with a reveling cloth in front of your father, then it is wrong; donig onlyfans and whoring is not empowerment."
dhruv rathee respect button ✅
"Cherry picked content almost like a propaganda video. Feminism is nothing but a female supremacist movement which is quite visible in western countries at present. As for equal rights and opportunities for both genders, their already existed a term for that called ""Egalitarianism"", way before feminism came into existence."
"I don't know who is the writer of your script but whoever he is, has a very high level IQ. He isn't like typical sigma from ig reels. I am proud I am feminist."

"Brother , i know that my comment will not change your view on animal movie(not only this film but any film) ... But still its just a film its the director's liberty to show his character or characters in a certain way , and we as viewers can like or dislike it , how can this be cancer?  Will a film change a man or woman ... If a man or a woman changes according to film character its that man's fault.. not the directors or the actors na?  In my view animal was an oke type of movie without no logic and no law and order..  but i enjoyed watching it ...i liked ranbir's character that doesn't mean that i want to be like him ..  i have also enjoyed watching  javier bardem's character from no country for old men ...that was a classic masterpiece and he is more violent than ranvijay ... In the end its just a film ..enjoy it or not your choice but it can cause nothing to viewers ..its like eating a fruit eat the good part and throw away the roten parts. ( My personal view as a movie lover)"

"Kids ion valentines day : ❤️🫶🏻
Smart kids on Valentine’s Day : *watching Dhruv rathee *"
"Dhruv, This is the first video ever of yours that I have watched fully , completely without skipping anything and I must say you are outstanding when it comes to explain something. Your research work, chronology, information and examples used in the video are perfectly aligned with the topic. 
Like any good teacher or guide, you left it on viewers to which idea they want to support...👏👏👏"
"Equal rights hr sensible insan accept krta hai k milna chahiye lekin Jo cheezien yeh feminist movement Wala krta Hain apna protest ma , Unka slogan even being a woman I feel ashamed . We accept that women should have an equal salary, she should have the right of  education but l never see such slogans in protest . They just want vulgarity nothing else."
"Kuch logoko feminism ki meaning lag raha hai 👉   (Jo kam male gender karta hai wo ladki bhi karege ...likin ehapar koi support nahi karega ki female log jo karti hai wo male gender kare) and this thise is brutal truth druv rathe sir ....Example : indian articles mai ek larki se jaida ek ladki ko advantage jaida milta hai 
..pehle wo thik hona chaiye  , bus seats , divorce financial settlements etc....I  only support  good human being 🎉"
keep your bullshit with you brother. get stronger. be a man
"I agree with Dhruv on many points but not all. Being a classical feminist, I don't think women are truly liberated through the later waves of feminism."
"i wanna date a person whio understands all these stuffs
lev u dhruv"
"Hello sir
Main ek feminist theory researcher hu. Aapne jo bhi feminism ke bare mein kaha ek point bhi galat nahi balki bahut sahi bahut ache hain❤❤❤🎉🎉 👏🏻 😊"
Feminism is not good ❌
Nice explanation.
You make awesome videos 😍
Just wow🔥✅
True introduction of feminist
Toxic feminism ke baare mei baat karne ko bola tha lmao.
Thanks dhruv
Just want to say WTF😂

❤❤
Dhruv does it again!!! Good work!

"I wanna ask whether If a woman does not give as good of a performance in a particular job than a man doing the same job...
Should both of them get equal pay






Example : In sports like football women complain that they don't get equal pay however they get around 20mil but the match stadium isn't even packed and tickets and not sold out
In other case in men's football the whole stadium gets booked which results over billions in revenue 
Still percentage-wise men get less pay than women by that logic"
Nice video 👍
Animal wali video me aapne toxic masculinity ke bare me baat ki magar is video me aapne toxic feminism ke bare me baat nahi ki
Lekin aaj ke ladkiyo ko dekh kar lagta hai ki pahle inhe azadi na dena koi galat nahi tha 🤐
"Exactly, We need to understand  real Feminism"
faminist ka meaning acha explain kiya uske baad k video or example faltu hai...
Hats off to You bro 🫡❤
"If you look carefully at what feminism is today. It claims to be about equality, but pushes very strong on all fronts in SHEquality. You dont need feminism to understand equality anymore. You definitely need JUSTICE, LIBERTY & DEMOCRACY."

"Dhruv you are a fabulous person, very well explained.  Very important message 👏"
🔥👍
Bro tum jab bhi koi vide bnate ho uske related koi na kli book Kuku fm pe hoti hai . How ? Aap kya kuku fm ke according video bnate ho ?😂😂😂😂😂
Maine khud ko imagine Kiya Jobless 🥲
"So glad to see a man talking about this....
Matriarchy and patriarchy both are bad and suffering shall not be inflicted on anyone 
It's about living and letting others live
If alimony ruins lives then dowry also does
But does women lift 50 kgs like men? Then can men give birth or nurture children?
Our bodies are different and working together with love and respect towards each other can make the world prosper and I don't know what's better than living in a world where women are not afraid of men throwing acids or assaulting and men not being afraid of someone gaslighting them and taking every responsibility on their children. 
(This is only for the amazing women and men out there,wrong is wrong despite the age and gender)"
"Maine aapka 2-3 video he abhi dekha hu .
kahna chaunga ,bhai tum lazawb hoo."
muje ye weham ho gaya tha k Dhruve Rakhtee sb BJP cult ki tarha ni lakin Salman Rushdi Jesy Lannati insan ko Legendry kehne waly per akhh thooo. kafi respect thi tumhry lia per lannat hai ab
Bahut badhiya video hai bhai
We live in a judgemental society thats it.💯👍
Agar kisi feminist ne support nahi dikhaya neha ko ya uss Lucknow ladki ko ya four kore shots jaise movies ko toh kisi ladki ne strongly condemn bhi toh nhi kiya. Khamoshi bahut kuch bolti hai. Agar hai koi ladki jiske paas logical answer hai to iska jawab de.
Patriarchy and feminism have their own benefits. Both can co exist but feminism can never overcome Patriarchy.
First time Dhruv rathee ki video acchi lagi ❤
Feminism sucks 😂😂😂
"भाई आपने सब का नाम लिया लेकिन जिन्होंने औरतों को बराबर का अधिकार दिया जिन्होंने हिंदुकोड़ बिल लाया जिसे हिंदू औरतों ने ही मनाने से मना किया था। उस महान शक्स का नाम तुम कैसे भुल सकते हो। 
वो थे महान भारतरत्न नॉलेज of simbol

Next topic on INCELS in India
if u supports femanism u should add wife in your video and sister also
You are absolutely right
India me ladkiyoko jo adhikar hai vahi ladko ko bhi milne chahiye
"Subscribed to your channel for this ❤
Thank you so much for making a video on such an important topic. It's hard for women alone to bring awareness to these things. It is crucial for men to speak up as well. I'm so glad our generation has someone like you to look up to them. Please do keep making amazing videos like this!! 😊"
"Inspired by this video! Not good enough to be praised, just tried! :(

Ah, must to let off steam about this person called Pat.
I thought he was suave but it turns out he is simply a jerk.

He slithers around, trying to insert his distorted ideas into everybody’s head
A kind of mind-controlled villain scripted badly like that.

He talks continuously about women and how they should “behave,”
As though they were mere ornamental figures meant to please a man’s vanity.

Claims they should keep quiet, be docile, take orders,
Which means that every woman is reduced to just being a puppet without any voice or choice in her life.

And then he adds in this whole spiel about “heaven for obedience,”
But really what he wants is for them to be hostages under his control.

It’s sickening really, scary and manipulative too;
Enough to make you want to yell and throw something hard.

But we’re not falling for this ancient bunkum for another moment!
This whole thing of “women listen, men rule” is over already!

Everyone – boys, girls—it doesn’t matter—mutual respect should be the watchword,
Pat’s views can go rot in some dark corner of cyberspace somewhere around here.

So let’s remain strong unitedly. Let Pat leave us alone now!
We are trying build a world where everyone has a voice that will be listened to by giving them chances thus far unheard of from us in life. 

No more groveling before these insane laws anymore!
Now we are changing the end; hence it will be happy endings for all the people this time around."
"He talks nothing about casual hook up culture while being in a relationship. Media is trying to normalize it why? 
Fake rape cases filed by women to extort money from men
So called sexual liberation giving men leeway to take any responsibility of their actions. 
Women making easy money through sites like onlyfans and not trying to build a good career

The yaaas queen culture which doesn't hold women liable and women can utter literal shit about man, body shame them, make a reference to the size of their sexual organ and being applauded for the same
Glorifying earning money through only fans and what not"
Guys he is talking about the fringe minority of female who believe in the true definition of feminism not the majority of 'em who r spreading the toxic femininity in the name of equality.
nice video bro it really changed my mind
Bade bhai kanoon sare women ke liye hai jo ladki ne bol diya wahi sahi hai our sab ladke ki galti nikalte hai
"Why do his vedios make so much sense man!!

You are great dear. Love ❤from Pakistan
"1. Women empowerment is a sexist word which has been drilled into people's minds. . It must  be replaced by ""HUMAN EMPOWERMENT"". How many of you agree?
2.  how many of you know that there is ""Men's day"" like ""Women's day"". How many of you see mens day status in your friends' whatsapp status?. Very few or rarely. In my opinion, there is no need of women's day. They should change the name of the day.
3. When you state the obvious for enough times, everyone gets annoyed. Like that is the concept of feminism.Feminism concept should be as old as taj mahal by now lol. It has no significance in todays world whatsoever. Also if a word is supposed to mean equality between men and women, then how the hell can one make a word called ""feminism"". It must be ""humanism"""
8:58 she is woman😂😂😂😂and treid somthing different...

I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT FOR YOU MAN!!
"These so called ALpHa MaLeS made  Feminism, like it's some intergalactic cringe."
"feminism isn't a bad word but some toxic man made it look like it's something very bad, feminism has nothing to do with but to enhance the women of our society, we need men to support women like every father wants their daughter to be indipendint please educate yourself[not to dhruv] a strong man can only handle a strong women."
I am with patriarchy. Like if you are also agree
"Bro can you research the value of women in Islam,"

"If feminism support equal rights for both, why any feminist did not raise voice against that Lucknow girl and  against any pro female laws???  No rathee sir feminism nnever talk about mens rights.  And why u do not quote the duties while talking about rights???"
Jb samaj ladko ko rone nhi deta.tabhi.to.uske andar toxic mosculanity ati or mai matture or logical thinking rakhta hu pr na hi mujhme toxic mosculanity h na hi criminal mind set or  bhai.

Great video... Nailed it
First time ever I heard someone talked about it from the basics.. love you bro ❤❤ what an explanation ❤️
😊😊😊😊
Should have covered Jordan Peterson as well
So what I don't understand is that if you are a feminist then why do more than half of the girls have laws?
Love  this moment  😊❤❤
"Got clarified about the topic you have covered, had an idea but now I have a clear cut definition of what it is"
Dhruv rathee is very popular man ❤❤
"Modern feminism is a joke, agenda of modern feminism is how to annoy boys or guys and how to show off with our rights. And that's why I feel so called chapris are right......"
"11:29
jb berojgar aadmi bologee t female ki image kaise aayegi"
Hats off sir ❤
"Thank you dhruv 

"" And i am a feminist....."" Snaps"
Nice 👌👌👍
Thank you
India is too complex
Then why a woman who educated or well settled or financially healthy doesn't marry a male who is less then her in everything...but we male can even that is our duty .... I'm not a faminist i can say openly...by the help of faminism word they want to suppress us nothing else ....i admit it women are equal bt they doesn't admit at all ...they just want to lift over us....
For acceptance these Women bargain with patriarchy to suppress other women's ambitions
Feminism is not bad...but  it's bad when they're living in a Equal Environment and also protesting against men without any reason...then it means that they're wanting To be Dominant on men in society....m
❤❤
🙏🙏🙏
"Being a girl I support that laws should be made regarding fake rape, dowry cases in India. Real cases are overshadowed under these fake ones and always innocent victim suffers either male or female. This is what equality is."
But what about those kind of woman jo sirf laws ka jhootha case bana kar ak innocent person ko jail me dalwa deti
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Pure illogical thoughts hai
"Brother, you forgot the main man in India who gave constitutional and legal rights to women Bharat Ratna Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. And he even gave resignation from the committee when objected about it. Rest this was a much needed video"
"Asa to kuch nahi 
I am Muslim girl .
Ma khud marji sa burkha phna hu .
Par mari maa na sab time muja support karte hai.
Education. dress . And many things.❤❤
I really❤ my mother ."
Even Indian law not giving equal right men and women.women more rights than men and some women misused their right what about them?Is anyone talking about that? Most Indian law favour women right.what about men rights?
"Or eise vi ladki hote Hain Jo ladko ke uper fake rape cases file karte hain , to Keya ladkio ko ek team main rakna sahi hain 😡"

"The actual and real alpha male or sigma is Dhruv... I have insane respect for this man.. As a teenage girl I've learned here more than anywhere in my life tbh... Just a big salute to him. 
You are the real sigma🗿 
Thank you so much this. 
Like who agrees."
Bro literally made this video only for likes😂😂
"I am often being said as Feminist if I talk about my rights..... While I need equality in many things then I also get vocal about men's right..... Yes physical strengthwise a man's body is stronger but that shouldn't be a reason ro deny the rights to a woman as human beings....... And then comes the issue that again ' if we need equality in pay and political participation and access of facilities for all human then why there are special seat for women metro trains or in buses'...... Well how to make these males understand that physically we work more than you and has some problems more than you so those priviledges like a seating arrangements reserved for us, a separate women boggie or something like that is needed.....and that is also the part of giving 😢equal opportunity to us .....  
Hats off to u Dhruv Rathee🙏🏼🙏🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼.... Became a fan of u❤❤ Respect 🖖🏼🖖🏼🙌🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼"
I am big fan dhurv rathee
❤❤❤❤❤
"When you talk about traditions/religion/culture, why is it specifically for the Sanatan religion/culture and not a single reference to any other religion, specifically for Islam. Could have given some illustration. This exposes your hypocrisy!! 😄
Classic example of hypocrisy. 
Don’t say it wasn’t relevant here bro! 😅"
The only video of this man which I like
❤❤❤
23:12 Men can move around without a T-shirt but can women do that
23:31  man are polygamous by nature but women are hypergamous by nature
I want to share something that yaha bhot women h jo log isliy job independent hone ko value dere h kyu ki ldhke wale kuch na ho khas to b dahej mangte h indirectly sundr ldhki chahiye hoti h but ldhki jo. Man dekhti h or pese n or sath Dene kliy uska job krti h esi ldhkiyo ki value n hoti apne ghr pe na sasural p isliy yesb dekhte hue b ek gusa hota h uske andr. Pr fr b right one wil be with right one if they'll wait. Who will value them n treat equally.
"9:18 what a logic🤣🤣After some decades he will compare a child with an adult and say, both of them have two eyes."
M sooo dammnn proud Girl ki childhood se group jesi chize mujhe psnd n hai jo gu khaye tum b vhi khao gye kya esa meri mmy ne sikhaya tha or meri soul bhi faltu ki fake or glt chize nhi psnd thi chahe kite bhi log mere khilaf hojate the or issi galat ka sath na Dene ke  nature ke krn mujhe bhot bully sehna pdhra tha but. Tb b me strong hoti gyi or bhi zada ❤❤️‍🔥
Justice in better than all these terms !
Finally... finally... somebody actually understood what feminism is and what patriarchy + matriarchy are!
23:58 but use punishment uss level ki nhi mili . Agar ladke ne mara hota tab 14-15 sal jail me hota 😂
It's all about equality
💯💯
"Refrain from using the word ""chappri"". It is a casteist slur."
Waah Bhai ❤❤❤ vedio bahut ❤❤aachi banaya 🥰🥰😘😘😘
😂😂clap
Jo aurate feminism ko support nhi karti wo kayar hoti hai unhe kisi chij ki responsibility bhi nhi leni aur risk bhi nhi lena sirf princess wali treatment chahiye 🥱😒
"Don't listen to him guys, be tough and strong hearted. This guy is great at manipulation. Women don't like weak men. The kind of men he's talking about who should be kind and who should cry, those typical nice guys always get friendzoned and cheated 90% of the times it has already been proven. Don't listen to his manipulations be toxic in this harsh world."
"A lot of ideas, concepts in the video are flawed. The research seems to be derivative...taken from popular narratives floating around. The definitions are simplistic, the assumptions are unfounded and conclusions drawn are amateurish.

Please read the books Selfish Gene or The Moral Animal to get an informed perspective on these controversial terms. Pitting one against the other is simply playing to the galleries. Doesn't help address the real issues."
22:55 bilkul सही baat h.....
"Feminist wanted to blame someone, so they blame ""patriarchy"" for everything wrong in the world ..

this video clearly shows.. how feminists brainwash.... by quoting that only their view is ""progressive"" ... those who don't believe in it are ""regressive""

isn't this thought itself partial ?"
11:48 bilkul sahi 🙃🙃
Hn
"I am a feminist but please do mention the points of unequal rights in the indian society given to men and women.....Voilence against men and the legal rights men have in those situation,Fake allegations/misuse of rights by women,Reservation, After divorce childs custody and alimony,(The matriarcy part of the indian society),and many more issues.
What i mean to say is legally men are not safe and do not have equal rights"
"There is a difference between feminism and toxic feminism but again people are suffering more cause of toxic feminism.
And currently matriarchy is more on rise. If a girl slap u in front of everyone, most probably no one will try to stop but not in case of men. Men will be men is not of nothing. Men have different urges and needs than female and vice versa , whether in human society or in wild. Ur take bout violence , i dont not fully agree with , cause fighting is in our biology in our nature thats why men are called providers cause u have to fight in order to get what u want , this doesnt mean we cant be civilised and participate in violence every time , but if ur a man and didnt had any fight in ur whole life ur not a man .U talked about feminism.., its a very good video , iam a feminist myself , but i will also like to see ur video about matriarchy and patriarchy specifically."
Don't be full Dhruv. They are look like female but actually they are musculine energies rulled by their mind. And they have spreaded out through-out the world
India needs people with this kind of mindset ❤Hats off to Dhruv Rathee for real content.
Main Kisi bhi chij Ka Sath Nahin Karunga Fir Bhi ladki Apna authority ka istemal karti hai Ladkiyon ko barabar Chhoti Nahin chahie lekin uska class ka istemal karti hai aur Ladka kam Karta Hai Ladki Agar Ek Hi Kam Karti Nahin chahie ladki ladki ki body ladki se jyada hot Hoti Hai uski photo ladki ladki ki body mehnat karne ke liye Bani Hui Hai Ladkiyon ko kam karna chahie ismein Koi galat baat nahin likhane Wali Ladki mein jyada paise kamate Hain ki apni pati ko batana jo hai ki main Tujhse Jyada kam Aati Hai to Fir Mujhe Teri jarurat kya hai new personality Jaanta hun
"Yes, truth is cleared"
"Bro there are several metrics that must be included when comparison is made...
Feminism is a disaster brother, women already have every spaces available...
If the metrics are sex gender, skill risk taking then metrics prove u wrong...
Thats why there 70% or more ceo of the companies, it not about ideals its about power competence brother..."
Make a video on indian cast system please🙏
"आपने दोनों पक्षों को बहुत ही सुन्दरता के साथ प्रदर्शित किया है। आसानी से समझ आने वाली आपकी सरल भाषा, आपके चैनल की सबसे बड़ी विशेषता है। आज के परिवेश में जहां एक तरफ लोग स्वयं को आधुनिक बनाने की होड़ में इंग्लिश को प्राथमिकता देते हैं, वहीं आधुनिकता के माध्यम से आपका विषयों को अपनी मातृभाषा में समझाने का ढंग बहुत ही अच्छा है। शुभकामनाएं। 🎉"
you spoke up my thoughts bro.
"Yes , lets give 50% jobs of Bricklayer, truck driver, Mines worker, shoe polish, washroom cleaner to women.
Equal right comes with equal responsibility . 

And women should start filling jobs from bottom up, instead of wanting 50% share in high level power positions only."
"There's a thing we all know you can't provide equality but you can try to provide the justice to the people
If you know what I'm talking about you may agree with me"
Films do say about the face of society mr.dhruv I hope you know what I'm talking about
We complete each other but we are not equal that's it
"Apne wo to btya nhi 
Jo indian society Womens ko special status deta hi 
Unki respect sabse jyada hoti hi ... 
Unki sunwyee male se jyada hoti hi... 
Mahilo ka special status to hamra culture tradition raha hi vedic age se hi... 

Womens ko to hum pujte hi... 
Ha time je sath sath unka status decline hua jinme muslim invasion, Sariya kanoon,unnecessary regulations, increased
 crime wagera se 
Aur hamara Constitution unko special previlize bhi deta hi 
Bhout se kaanon bhi hi 
Reservation bhi mil rha hi 
Women workforce participants bhi bada hi 
Aur age aise bhout se kaanon ane hi jise women empowerment hoga

"24:40 FEMINISM jo word hai , aur jo meaning hai , ye match nahi karta hai . Isliye loag galat matlab nikalte hain . Unka kasoor nahi hai . Aur khatam to sirf patriarchy hona chahiye , ussi se kaam ho jayega . Society ko good and progressive Insaano ki jaroorat hai feminist ki nahin . Aur constitution me to sab equal diya rakha hai , phir konsa equality ki ladai ladni hai ?"
"23:50  , bhai so called feminists ne isko support to nahi kiya lekin khulke oppose bhi nahi kiya na !!😂😂"
Feminism koi galat nahin hai lekin mo Naya trend chala h culture barbad karne ka....daru pi ke gaali dena anything ye sb bekar h
"Most woman after working for 3-4yrs says ""I wish I get married and need not have to work so much"". Why do they say it? Because woman psychology is built in a way that they choose Hypergamy structure, they want a person to lead, someone to protect, dont have to put so much head into using so much of mind in logical thinking compared to men, they will say they hate Patriarchy mindset, toxic men etc but will seek men to date with toxicity, masculinity. They will loose interest towards men who cries... and this is all utter nonsene. They dont have an ability to take decisions on personal level such that they as for reviews for 3-4 saheli and want men to do most stuff which requires using brain."
"woman will speak to abolish Patriarchy mindset, but will choose a man as per Patriarchy mindset,"
"I didn’t get it. 
First half talked about feminism and its role in the past and it is for equality for both sides, aka male and female. 
But in second half, only talked about what feminism had given to the world, like vote for women, individuality rights at home, etcs , which you only talked about what it did for women. 
Weren’t you the one who talked about feminism doesn’t mean it meant for only women just because it is named as a feminine word. 
After all those talks, you didn’t gave a good example what feminism has done to males? 
Well you didn’t even bothered to talk about what this new waves of feminists are doing to the world in name of feminism. You didn’t even talked about how they are misleading the words feminism, and using it for their advantage. 
You said, “there were no feminist said what ever the roadies women talked was right” but in contrary, there were no feminist denying it too. I don’t see any of these new wave feminist doing anything, ngl. 
And I won’t even bother start talking about the rights what women has comparing to mens , which is good thing for women safety, but all of them were good? Nothing like advantage? Anywho.
Tbh, women gets equal pay for their jobs. You are smart you know that is debunked, but still talking about that kinda makes me wonder about your intentions influencing the crowd.
I remember you talking about “to make a lie sound true, add a bit of truth and facts”, kinda sus now.
Nothing against feminism, it was a greatest act for empowering women, but the way you glorified it as it’s for male and female was a nice talk but didn’t have any powerful reason. 
Stating facts (meaning) of something is fine, but you forgot about how the meaning of things changes throughout time decay. 
Taking about the deceased waves now and saying it is good, doesn’t gives the fact that feminism changed its meaning and values according to the different waves."
"GURU GOBHIND SING JI NE OR THE SIKHISM IS made for every human to be A worrier, IM PROUD OF IT, I AM GIRL BUT IN OUR CULTURE EVERYTHING IS !! EQUAL !!"
You are master at spreading propaganda D
"Lucknow wali ghatna par kisi feminist woman ne support nahi dikhaya lekin kya unhone khulkar chillkar iska virodh kiya ? Kya iss ladki ke liye kade punishment ki demand ki gayi thi un feminist women ki taraf se? 
Jab mamla police ke paas gaya tha toh uss ladki par action lene ki jagah ulta ladke par shanti bhang ki karyavahi kar di gayi. Agar video viral na hota toh kya hota ? Aap samajh sakte hain. 

Aaj ke samay me purushon ko samaj me darkar rehna pad raha bhale saari galti ladki ki ho.

Ab samay aa gaya hai ki purushon ke adhikaron ke liye bhi usi tarah baat ki jaaye jis tarah mahilaon ke adhikaron ke liye ki jaati hai."
Simp
Lonelyness i agree👍
Wonderfully explained!!
true saying about man loneliness....

Our society has evolved in present shape through the journey of hundred of years and it will continues as it is. The discussion will also be continued without no result.
The shows like Bigg boss selects toxic feminists and make hate on real feminists.

"There are different schools of thought in the feminist movement and it has changed overtime. 

One specific aspect of the feminist movement is for women to be ""free"" and lead their life as they choose. One aspect of this which must be mentioned because it is an objective is that women must be able to work as sex workers and be accepted and loved in the society, they must be able to have promiscous life and still be accepted without hesitation by future husband, they must be able to have sex with any man or even woman they chose with consent and marriage is not important. The simplest way for women to earn money, fame and appreciation is to become a prostitute/dancer/escort/sugarbaby/stripper/pornstar. This means that as feminist movement becomes strong, expect divorce rate to go up, expect lot of children outside wedlock (bastered children), expect many women to have so many sex partners that they become unable to lead faithful life and as they become old they end up alone with no husband or even children, expect sex work to become widespread. Basically, expect the sex discipline to be lost in society which will lead to most severe chaos in the long run where children grow up in broken homes.

The most proper way to run society is for the male and female nature to be kept separate and not be mixed and have separate well defined roles for them that do not need to be forced into being mixed."

"The real fact is the men and women are equal in totality....they have different responsibilities .....men and women have different responsibilities.....both type of responsibilities are equally important.

So women should be proud of their responsibilities and society should give them respect for fulfilling their responsibilities......and women should opt for such kind of jobs that allow them to live a good family life and give enough time to take care of their children also..

Some jobs like are very tough and require so much time that don't allow women to live their family life.


For example we respect Kalpana chawala a lot....but she was not able to take care of family she got divorce ...so we should have balance


Also women are equal to men...

We don't want to give double responsibilities to women like earn money also take care of home also....so women should do easy and comfortable  job so that to get enough time for family life"

"Your argument about the organs reflects your understanding of the matter. A small difference in the biology does not make them any stupider or well, even tho quite easy to believe by the amount of evidence, less competent. Man and woman are very different creatures, psychologically. Feminism is not just about rights, it's a very corrupted thing. It was in its real form in the last century. Women with the same level of power will use it in a much much worse way than a man, who doesnt use it particularly well either. They did not evolve this way. I dont know what kind of reasoning your boycut writers use, but the truth is, we are glorified apes."
Feminism was possibly a thing in the last century. Today's feminism is much much closer to matriarchy. You dont live in this world mate.

"Dhruv Rathee, you are highly confused with the concept of women empowerment and Feminism. The the positive intake belongs to women empowerment and the negative things goes to feminism. And I bet you 90% of male people are feminist because they think feminism and women empowerment is same.
You explained everything correctly from the Start but today feminism = hatred towards Men"
"Patriarchy is bad for men too
So all the men who are here arguing 
So yk what, thus Patriarchy is the only reason of high su1c1dal rates in male cuz u guys are the one who bully your own kind id they're little different from you
Look at our religion where faminism was always a thing
It all changed due to early british era and early mughal era in India
Hinduism never supported patriarchy 
No religion supports violence, injustices and inequality!!!!
Feminism isn’t the problem, supporting one gender more than other is problen whether its a girl or boy !!! Both men and women is important for the society!!!
Feminism isn't again men. Patriarchy is against both genders"
"I think as a men I know what feminism is and I knew it before before anybody told me about this and you don't need to be a professor to analyse this by your own. But I think women should be more educated about what truly feminism is. Because what I have experienced till now is men understands it, it is the women who don't."

"Agreed on many things also disagreed  on many things.. Just 1 thing I wanna point out. At the time of war Women are not forced to go in front line and get killed like a man, they are very protected even now... So thats one of the main reasons that before men didn't like the idea of women vote because its mens life on the line so they wanted to vote accordingly to bring the best govt and serve them...

Also men and women are not same... Both have different roles in society that are equally important...
Don't defame women who don't identify as feminist..."

"Hi Dhruv Equality ! In the Indian society, General conception REGARDING OLD AGE SURVIVEL, GENERALLY MIDDLE INCOME GROUP FAMILIES FIX THEIR OWN PRIORITIES DEPENDING UPON THEIR MONTHLY INCOME. You might have seen that in the houses socities, Many houses are left abondened ! If you have not seern/think , pls do observe as to why it is so ?
Most of such people do not give their property on rent/Lease etc, As they are affraid & sure that after their retirement, For their own uae the said house will not be vocated by the Tanent.
Because of this cause, good number of litigations are pending the Courts from decades together ! Why ?
This is the problem of common person rather than VIP ( Politicians / Seniors retired Officers from the Govt job ie having big say in the society.
On the others hand thousands / Lacks of houses are laying vacent.
Without blaming the people,  blame the Laws made by the Govt / Present Govt for not taking care the problem.
Same problem with the commercial property is more dangerous ( as many times land into MURDER OF EITHER PSRTY because of disputes of property because of the poor Laws / Poor Goverance.
Pls tell me , you have taken my house on lease for 5 yrs. Well in advance I inform you in Writing that next renewal will not be done. Because after my retirement, I will prefer to live in our own house.
Worst part is , If I go to Court , for decades together decision will not come & house will not be vocated.
Apparantly, Who is at fault:-
1. Land Lord 2. Tanent 3. Laws  & Orders ?
It is general Problem.
Would you kindly raise this issue."

"Keeping equal rights apart. 
The difference between men and women are too deep and at different levels than just two or three organs.
The physiology, psychology etc of two sexes is quite different so much so the form two distinct subsets of a same set. These differences are crucial in determining their social roles. Being humans they are equal in worth and no one is superior/inferior to the other. Rather complement one another to achieve the objective of their being different.

Feminism is to smash patriarchy - out of our lives!
"Talk about women rights and equality but also talk about other side of feminism which is toxic. The way Bollywood is spreading the idea jo aurat jitni nangi hai, gold digger hai, partner py cheating krne wali hai, woh itni feminist hai. Feminism ka asal chehra tabah kar k asal wali feminism ko v badsurat bana diya hai."

"We already know the hypocrisy of Indian feminists groups, in 2011 the govt passed a law to make rape laws gender neutral but the feminist group opposed this law like they are going for a war, this shows the feminism on google and in reality is different"
"Sorry, 'true Indian' social structure's distruction started from the 10 centuray AD and was complete by the 12th centuary. New rhetoric was generated by some to create what is the popular belief system in this southern sub-continent. So what you see today as indian culture was not the culture which you associate with India - the world leader.  Culture - the way of life is what makes a nation, and you can see what the creators of this culture bought true indians to - slavery for the last 12 centuries and still continuing with very good prospects of it becoming a permanent fixture for next few thousand years.Even southern india which was a matriarchal society, is run by male chauvinist's, the example is best painted in the history of Punjab. The only places left untoched were the tribal areas which still maintained their culture but in the last 7 decades that is lost too, instead of learning from them people have taught them the arts of artful dogger. With a super dogger is consider a Superman in this society."
What about Emily Dickinson the famous poet
"ये हैं कौन कोई आईएएस अफसर कोई पीसीएस अधिकारी कोई समाज सेवी

हाथ उठा उठा कर एक्सप्लेन तो ऐसा करता हैं जैसे कोई प्रोफेसर है

Ap nahi hote to Mera kya hota"
"Thank you for this, Dhruv."
mujhe bohot gaaliya mil sakti h but my question is ki agar ladke ne kuch kiya toh voh abuse hojata h and jesa apne bola ki kisi femenist ne neha ji ya voh road vaali ameer ladki ko support nai kiya but kya support na krrne se sabb hojayega kya unko unke kiye k liye guilty feel nhi krrvana chahiye imean ki support nahi krri but unke khilaaf koi actions bhi toh nai leti and agar femenism equality pe believe krrta hai toh unki responsiblity h ki voh action le but kya liye gye kabhi
"the way you have talked on this topic is an indication of your magnificent emotional intelligence, you are so empathetic i cant believe it, you really did put yourself in women's shoes and viewed the world from their perspective and you did an absolutely splendid job!"
"Problem tab nahi hai jab admi ke upper aurat dwra atyachar karne par feminist female ko support na kare, problem thab hai jab admi pe aurat dwara atyachar karne pe feminist men ko support nahi kare. Jabke reverse case mai vo feminist jee Jaan se female side ko support karega."

"why some of the girls prefer not losers body builders making fun of the mens  they prefer strong men rather than the losers what are you even saying that the feminist are talking about us no they are not i am not against feminism but so many of the feminist only talks about the females.what if a man is beaten in front of their girl the girls left ,where are they and they will not adjust in the situation"
"I think you are great but you are only on the one side to not lose of your viewers, so also promote the good things happen not only the bad things about india and their foreign and internal relations you did not make any of the internal matters such as bengal killing and all. just one side not enough,yaa abd that's we call the horse trading of social media influencers."
Feminism is started in Europe and they are lot's of rights but still eurupe rape cases India rape cases increasing day by day 😢
"Men and women are biologically different but aren't different shen it comes to equal rights.
2+2=4
3+1=4"
Thats why femenists successfully protested against criminalisation of male r*pe back in 2013? Because of equality?
"This is clearly one sided video. What about the saying ""save women and kids first"" whenever any catastrophe arises? What about the fact that a man is supposed to lift the luggage and fix a flat tyre?? 

There can't be equality due to clear biological distinction. There's a reason there are two biological genders."
"Right hai
I am always respect to all women"

"Feminism is about accepting women at their word, and trusting their actions. They say they're in pain? Then they're in pain. They say a man makes them feel unsafe? That man needs to learn not to do whatever it is that's scaring her. They have the same job as a man? Pay both of them the same wage! Feminism arose because of patriarchy yes, but fighting feminism is like saying someone needs to lose weight without even thinking for a second they're overweight because they'd diabetic and this breaking their food down differently: treat the cause, not the symptom.
Every man should have to take the period simulator. All the way up to 10. Then we can talk about fairness and equality."

"In today's time, many females overuse their gender as they can do some things which are prohibited to boys due to social evils"

But years after i told this incident to my mom and she told me it was wrong you should cry if you wanted to. Whenever i recall this incident ii feel bad for that day...."

Bro u saud ki feminism ki defination girls k liye equal rights hon to bhenchod aurton k liye alrdy 40+laws exist krre h or boys ke liye kitne h??
"That is a very interesting take. Normally, people do not view feminism through this lens. But is feminism really as you claim it to be... Concepts of hyper-masculinity and matriarchy are pushed up at the thoughts of feminism... and I also wonder about one more thing.... What exactly are rights? One might say that they are objectively chosen... but is objectivity something to be supported cause who is this majority who chose these rights... or how were they brought about... and how are we so certain that they are ""objective"" (Note: Objectivity is something extremely modern and was non-existent in the pre-modern and the antiquity)... There are a lot of problems with feminism if we dissect it using philosophy, not that I am against it... Honestly, there is no perfect system that we humans have developed. Locke, Rousseau, Marx and others all tried their best to bring forth promising ideologies but truly none of those ideologies seem to be ""promising"". There is always a flaw... Just like in feminism... and the concept of genders... and the entire notion that they should all have ""equal human rights""... as idealistic as it sounds... in my opinion it causes more harm than good... Of course, anyone can disagree with me...

I should stop... 3 AM thoughts hit different :)
Note: I am not against feminism... Its just that feminism is not a stand alone concept... it brings forth so many other things as baggage or societal concepts with it that it either becomes distorted or harmful."

"I was a huge fan of dhruv rathee....but recently I did some fact checks....and then I realise he is just trying to manipulate people by telling people half truth.

Regarding this matter I have a theory....BLACK BOX Theory (Burqa)
Though it's great to empower and bring equality in the society ....but the charity begins at home....why didn't these ""So Called Liberal/Intellectual"" fools/actors start staunchly critising their own religion for keeping women in black box (Burqa) first and then start commenting on other religions.....that's why just like Salman rushdie had said

Badayu news per kuchh batayiye  sir
"Your whole video taking about equal rights equal rights but did not mention the right that men have but women don't, when we appose feminism we also appose discrimination,if a woman do any accident society let it pass ,but when man do something wrong you know the story. Truth is that today's feminists don't want equal rights as man they want to make women superior,if a man is being being treated bad they won't stand for it ,(most of the man feminists I meet on ground are people who just want to look like a gentleman in front of a woman (speak for man too😢)"

"What about the role hierarchy...it's also important to run a system..either a nation or a family.

Equal rights to shi h..as long as you equally take responsibility..
But in general a hierarchy will need to be maintained... either man lead or woman.
But leaders should always take additional responsibilities.

System is something developed with time..based on the effectiveness and efficiency."

Patriarchey - पितृसत्तात्मक
I am taller and have more athletic body than my husband. I earn more as well. Even my mother couldn't stop back-biting about him with other people. I still feel bad that people are educating themselves just to prove that their brain is filled with trash. I'm proud of my husband and will always be ❤
"the arguement that you called illogical like ""jis din men pregnant hona start hogai us din equality ai gi"" but after this you also give some illogical argument that ""aik bewakoof mard ko bhi aik wise man k equal right milty hain"" these both arguments are illogical :)"
Thanks dhruv भईया कोई नहीं समझता था कि अगर लड़का बेरोजगार हैं तो उसका सादी लगाना मुश्किल होता है लेकिन लड़की बेरोजगार हैं तो उसका सादी होना fixed hai. परन्तु ये लड़के के लिए एक अच्छी लड़की मिलना मुस्किल है. कोई नहीं बेरोजगार से सादी नही करती कोन कोन इस बात से सहमत हैं
You should talk about Gay homosexuality LGBTQ etc. I think now its becoming the most dangerous part of society.  Is it right or wrong?

Feminism becomes toxic when women think they don't need men n r higher than men
Agar Ladkiya pad likhega nahi toh haame female Police officer Female Doctor Female Teacher kaise melaga...
Agar kisi ladka jo relationship main hai uska dusre female friend ho toh koi baat nahi chahe use hug kare eksath photo khiche...they r just friends lekin agar yehi kaam woh ladki kare apne male friends ke sath ghume toh log use character certificate dene lagte hai
I think what causes confusion is the word feminism. The term could be coined as equalism so that people who judge the book by its cover wont get confused.
Dhruv sir i think some women also don't know the meaning of feminism. They want equal rights as men which is exactly fine but they don't want to accept the fact that it's alright for a men to earn less than women. even if some women accept this they don't apply this in their actual life.. they want a rich guy... Now some may say she just want secure future.. but why can't she earn herself ? She expects men to earn which is totally bad.
अरे भाई में तरी हर बात से संतुष्ट हू पर जो हमारे गीता पुराण में लिखा है हम लोग उसको हि मानते है अभी पुरी दुनिया देख रही है औरत क्या कर रही है भाई तभी हमारे पूर्वज बोलते थे औरत को बाहार निकाला तो ये दुनिया खराब हो जाऐगी में ऐसा नाहीं बोलता हू सब औरत ऐसे है करके
"Definition is nothing. Islam means peace. We know the violence and terrorism of prophet Muhammad. Islam has nothing to do with peace. Feminism claims about equal rights. But it has nothing to do with gender equality. Feminist mindset don't let men cry, feminist mindset push men to be masculine. Patriarchy and feminism are the same thing. Beating men is 3rd wave femnism. Feminism was necessary until 2nd wave. After that, feminism is not necessary anymore."
Tu apni bibi ko dhandha karne bhej de 😂 support feminism
"We all want equal rights for women. But was it necessary to attack the Hindu religion for that?!
We Hindus have been worshipping Goddesses for thousands of years, but still, you had to target only one religion. 
You didn't speak a word against women's oppression in Islam and the Quran, and neither did you speak a word about misogynist Muslim preachers, why Dhruv?

Now see this,
Quran 4:34: Men are caretakers of women, since Allah has made some of them excel the others, and because of the wealth they have spent. So, the righteous women are obedient, (and) guard (the property and honour of their husbands) in (their) absence with the protection given by Allah. As for women of whom you fear rebellion, convince them, leave them apart in beds, and beat them. Then, if they obey you, do not seek a way against them. Surely, Allah is the Highest, the Greatest.

But you didn't say a word against it, bro will only attack The Hindu religion because that's the easiest way to gain views. Your motive and your agenda are clear Dhruv, running false propaganda against The Hindu culture in the name of social movement.
Well done 👏👏"

man you got wrong t some points becuase the rights you talk about boys will ruin our sociaty and make our morals weak also weak men.
"How could you miss this famous name, Simone de Beauvoir, and her famous statement from her famous book, _The Second Sex_: 'One is not born, but becomes a woman.' It basically points out the difference between gender and sex: sex is a biological reality, but gender is a cultural construction. There is no truth as such in one's gender; you just put on your gender the way you put on your clothes. Now, the problem lies in the fact that putting on one's gender is not an innocent act; it is subject to sexual and cultural politics which creates inequality between the sexes."
"But what you are talking about is not currently pushed in feminist propaganda,  you can't ignore the fact that so many women are screaming feminism for multiple partner, hookup culture and stuffs as our body our rules in the name of feminism"
"There's not much inequality now left. This video would be right 10-20 years back.
At this moment of time this video seems overexageratting."
"Being a girl born in India, I can't but get amazed at how intrinsically accepted is the notion of patriarchy. Barabar hain hum. Tum padhai ki baat karo, kam opportunity hone ke baad bhi padhne ki curiosity hamme jyada hain. Gender just society ka idea idea hi reh na jaye. 🙂"
"Hi Dhruv, we are eagerly waiting for your impactful awareness videos on the following extremely serious issues/topics, which will be immensely valuable for your viewers and people in general to make an informed decision:
1. Electoral Bonds - SC verdict, SBI reluctance and non-compliance with SC directions, Quid-pro-Quo Connection with ED, IT, CBI raids and providing govt tenders to funders.
2. SC verdict on Delhi Govt's power over its Executives, and the Rash, Reckless and Authoritarian implementation of Delhi Ordinance by Central Govt.
3. PM Care Funds - Using PM name and face for creating a non govt donation campaign and then absolute secrecy on fud usage and transparency. 
4. ECI Selection Panel - Removal of CJI
5. Bilkis Bano - SC literally calling out in their verdict about the nexus between govt, Gujrat state machinery and criminals
6. Ram Rahim Parole - While Umar Khalid, Manish Sisodia, Satender Jain, Sanjay Singh no bail.
7. Unreasonable Govt Facilitations and Exceptions for Adani's private pre wedding - while zero facilities for Covid migrating workers etc."
Superb analysis
"As an ex student of geography major, we have read about feminism in human geography ❤ I am glad that dhruv is teaching everyone who thinks feminism is something bad but it's just ""equality of men and women"".❣️"

Tell me a law in Indian constitution which is made only for men and not for women.... Then what rights are we talking about?😂😂
Women empowerment yes.... Feminism big no.... Send feminist on war .... Why women allowed to leave from Ukraine when war broke out and men made stay in war zone compulsory... Half of construction workers should me women... Its easy to seat in ac cabin and cry for rights...  We all should fight for women empowerment but not fo feminism ....
Feminist are smelly...😂😂😂
Well done 👍✅

 people need to get educate and have some common sense first"
correct
"I've seen my mother's suffering from my father's conservative and patriarchal thinking, even though I love my father, but that mindset that women are just foot-shoe and nothing else. I won't let this thinking harm my daughter and I don't bear anything against women rights and existence. I'm feminist because I've seen my mother. That's it."
Feminism actually me kia hai you explained it v well mgr feminism ab kia ban chuka hai aur kis hadd tk apne actual definition se door hochuka hai vo aapne nai bataya....def of feminism has changed completely nowadays n has hardly to do anything with equal rights or equal payment etc....ab feminism APEY SE BAHER kuch ches hogai hai....

औरत शब्द का origin Arabic भाषा से हुआ है जिसका मतलब होता है  genitalia,"" ""defectiveness,"" & ""nudity.""

वो स्त्री है , वो कुछ भी कर सकती है ! 😌"

"Dhruv rathee, I would  suggest you, please read Satanic Verses of Salma Rushdie...and you will know how faminist he is....he is just a exploiting  man for woman....in fact when  he  wrote the filthy book Ahmad Deedat predicted, he  can not live with any woman for long and he divorced his wife soon and then  he married with Padma Lakshmi younger than  half of his age and divorced her also.....this guy isnot faminist he is a racist and devilist...."

Why you are mentioning a goon and  nonsense man Salman Rushdie 😡.
Very informative.... keep making these kind of videos
"I'm from Sweden. Feminism is continually humiliating our culture by promoting mass-immigration, multi-culturalism and the destruction of the Swedish man. They will come for you to India!!!!"
Precision of understanding man and woman equal rights means it's mental and soul how you progress equally stronger. But today pic entirely different between man and woman they chasing man any dominating nature how to come up physical way by crook or hook it's kind of toxic computation. But woman not understanding they own  character and respect loosing in the society at home. What you said absolutely right many old methodology understanding between man and woman different way. After all highly educated things are not change still remain same. Why? Bcoz we are moving towards material world. We all seeing and understanding in physical form. Our morality gone down to D grade   spiritually we er not uplifted new generation.  Last 20yrs woman was ruling de our country. Woman was top Leadership and  they have got every rights. Still what de hell woman chasing for rights and equality.  Still our country was most corrupt and women was not insecure crime increase woman exploited in many ways. Neighboring country try to  enter terrorist act increase this all happened under woman was ruling . If woman are  thinking we are weak that's problem within them. But unfortunately woman are more criminal in today's world.
Your all videos are very wonderful and fact based... Thank you sir
Let entire woman change gender then there will be equality.

"Yes Dhruv rathee is a true feminist, he waited in queue after many men finished his wife, then he got married ..,"
The problem with current feminism is that they are becoming man-hater and want to become the same men they hate. Current feminist demands advantages over men cause they have already achieved equal rights and equal opportunities.

I'm patriarchal and I proud to be so. I support and respect women to their limits. No hate for them. But A nation can never develop if that is led by women. Why there's no female presidents in superpower countries  like America? Cause they know the truth.

okay bro just listen me . According to this feminist stupid all men and female should get equal rights and in some sectors some seats should be preserve for females to maintain equality. Now you made a cricket team with male and female combination. Now the team is playing a match with Australia. Now tell me the female batsman can face 145+ kph balls. And they can take wickets with their 110+ kph ball .
Thank you very much for clearing meaning of feminism for people who don't know it
True Son👏🏻👏🏻 God Bless You 🙏🏻
"What is feminism and how they using this word in reality is totally different ....patriarchy is when men rule or enslave women...but this is not the case in reality...men themselves  are slave of culture,society ....most men are tired ,exhausted dying of taking responsibilities of everything including women.... these feminist   portray men as a cruel entity...I am not against women education or freedom but men's suffering and sacrifices should also be acknowledged...."
"In two cases that you talked about : the one about neha dhupia and the girl slapping the driver, you told that the feminists never supported these people. Well you are wrong. They were silent on the issue and they did not criticise. Silence is same as extending your support."

"the irony is that the very same feminism which neena gupta calls ""faltu"" has given her the ability to voice her opinion as a woman in the first place. the woman shouting into the microphone and condemning women's liberation can only do so because feminists have been fighting for HER right to speak and these anti-feminism ladies take this for granted. 
12000 years of structural and institutionalized oppression cannot be eradicated in a century or two. and being rich and privileged doesn't give you the right to dismiss the reality of millions of other women."

Please make the video on matriarchy and how it affect both genders
"Males alag hain females alag dono ka society my alag or important role hai .. both are equal important  but needs of both are not similar .. example females need holidays while delivery , periods but males don't need it , girls have to buy additional sanitary pads however males don't need it , girl can't afford husband , girls do job in easy format official jobs they can't work at foundry steel Mills heavy weight loading  unloading .. male can lead a family but female can't its reality . Both have to be get a freedom like a country  laws are formed such as you have rights doesn't  means you have right to kill someone."
Definition of feminism still same but there are few (both male and female) who misunderstand it and fight for thier idology.
Indian male hone ke baad bhi feminist hone ka ghamand hai😎😎
"यह भाई गज़ब चूतिया हैं, पश्चिमी संस्कृति की बयार में कुछ बेसिक बातें भूल गया हैं। आजकल फेमिनिस्म और फेमिनिस्ट की परिभाषा कुछ और हो चुकी हैं। भाई, बराबरी के अधिकार का मतलब बराबरी का अधिकार होता हैं। उसका मतलब नौकरी करना नहीं होता, उसका मतलब जबरदस्ती घर से बाहर जाना नहीं हैं। उसका मतलब घर पर खाना बनाना छोड़ना या साफ सफाई छोड़ना नहीं हैं। महिला की ज्यादा जरूरत परिवार को बनाये रखने और उसे जोड़े रखना हैं पैसा कमाना नहीं हैं। जिस काम में औरते ज्यादा कुशल होती हैं वह काम करना चाहिए। औरतें रिश्तों में गर्माहट बनाये रखती हैं। इसीलिए उनकी जरूरत परिवार और समाज को जोड़े रखने के लिए ज़रूरी हैं। अब जब उन्हें बराबरी के नाम पर जबरदस्ती नौकरी करवायेंगे, घमण्ड से फेमिनिस्ट कहलायेंगे तो समाज टूटेगा ही।

2. Is it a women slapping someone openly and then playing feminist card.
3. Is it a women whose husband beats her 
4. Is it a women who place fake charges and misuses her rights 
5. Is it a women who is raped by her husband and fears to do a court case 
6. Is it a women who has her freedom and goes to metro in bikini 
7. Is it a women forced to wear only a certain type of clothing 
It is up to you to decide"

"No matter what, both the sides have some genuine reasons, they have their pros and cons, so instead of debating on this, we should make a better society focusing on the point of loyalty, kindness and how both men and women would be safe mentally as well as physically. The verses which were written by our ancient ancestors which depicted some norms and regulations regarding society and the culture weren't very wrong, except some superstitions, most of those lines were contained a specific logic and base within them. And, stats are not always the end of debate, those are greatly relevant but we should very much be aware that, but it's not everything."
"I think whatever you told is very big misunderstanding and most of them is wrong, no one created all of this no one influenced anyone to do this it's just nature and Biology, men will be men and women will be women they both have their strength and weakness like a flower and a insect we have different strengths to live in this world, we both are never equal we are just similar looking two different puzzle pieces which makes a design, if you go for an abstract design then you are in the wrong universe you need to go for another Universe in multiverse"

If you protect your wife sister mother from humiliation by standing strong and fighting for them doesn't mean they are weak it's just that we are more masculine.
Thank you so much ❤
"Hi Dhruv, I regularly watch your videos and agree with you 98% most of the times. Just felt to give my opinion here, I agree men and women should be given equal rights socially and economically. However, there are certain things can be done exclusively by men or women. For example, if your family is in dangerous, it is natural for everyone to turn up to the man to protect them because of their physical strength. Women have better memory and mange finances better. I know these are all opinions but I’m not able to agree with you completely on this one. I respect women and both genders need each other. I just felt your video is putting an unnecessary pressure on people who are satisfied the way their lives are. Your education on the topic feminism is good somehow along the lines, there is some sort of persuasiveness. Hope you take this as a good critique and not take offence 😊"
I think people were commenting about toxic feminism.
Lekin equality hai kaha

"Anti feminism or chauvinism is in the blood of societies like India. All male and females of this country are brought up with a background mindset of superiority of male over females and thereby all adult males become dominant over females and all adult females become submissive over males in all respect. Opposite of this always criticized by the society. In some other countries true feminism may thrive, but not at all in a country like India. Because, in those countries, society always prefers the logic and system supports everything that have logical value without being selfish. But in a country like India society had been never ready to leave their tradition or culture either right or wrong and in contrast with other modern thinking countries, Indian system always encouraging to maintain the chore & chore traditions, whatever right or wrong, and effort is still continuing. So, Indian system never let one bad custom of the society to become oblivion. They will never make any rule to make a reform like other modern countries. So, equal rights to a women / girl is too far, it's time to save some household women / girl victims from frequent incidents of atrocity against women / girl that have been occuring specially in states like UP, MP, Rajasthan etc. of India. No system or society present their  is going to take action to end these things and in fact they have been supporting these things to continue forever."

I have always been a feminist but I do not align with the western narrative of feminism. Western feminists only speak up when white women are getting opressed and never when WOC are supressed or killed.

"a girl need a freedom, they want to live there life as there want, it's ok , we can't judge them ,but woman is like a diamond 💎, and dimond is so valueable, it's safe in one hands,  if diamond change hand to hand it get dirty the value of dimond is decreased, and now all girls deside u wanna be a diamond or a piece of glass"

bro why do you support toxic masculinity
"Legendary author Salman Rushdie 😂
Dhruv Rathee please do some research on Salman Rushdie read his books then come back with same thought of Legendary Author Salman Rushdie, 
Just to give you few points against him 1. He was a devil worshiper, he wrote books against Islam and other religions of world.
2. He gave bad words in his books to white people.
Etc etc."
Please make video about false cases in India

you are wrong Mr druve rathe men and women are not equal womens are higher than men and we are not homo sepians we are humans religion does not give inequality religion gives womens more respect we are humans not robots we cant think or live like a robot you are doing good thing but you should talk about anything before talk you should know everything very well equality does not mean that women's go outdoors and work anything    you are talking aboute equality but you don't talk about porn industries and shameless web series when you talk you should know very well if womens work for family it's wrong but they work as a air hostess and serve like a servent that's right research every thing ok

Watching your videos shows that your parents raised you very well❤
Bro pls make a video on caste system
"excellent explanation but i have to say thappad was bit exgrated real life doesn't work like that very high level of miscommunication is shown in the movie and at last it was shown that everything was about sorry that hero didn't tell her a single time throughout story but it was shown that hero was trying to save things but her wife only wants a divorce.Even if the things were in reverse a real man would have made her calm punish her later but in some different ways like psychological way that is what she should have done instead it was shown that she is a divorce lover, only divorce can give her justice. anyway your video was very good."
Thank you dR! 😊

Good.. Please read Hindu code bill. Written by dr. Ambedkar ji..
Feminism is the advocacy of Equal rights and opportunities for both men and women in all spheres of public life.
"Feminism to treat women equally for the social, economic and political arena and give them equal rights in public life."

A very inconclusive video....feminisim idea was right when it was started but now the definition of feminism has entirely changed and its become toxic feminisim
"No offence, Look at how Degenerate the West has become, broken society and a country, females in Only Fans which is considered as normal😂, multiple partners sex, cheating, high divorce rate, high percentage of male alone and addicted to Porn, broken family, broken society, with time no good women or men to marry, population drop, bad mental health, leading to economic drop,
Super woke culture, every word and sentence will be an issue, the list goes on and on.
Literally all these woke, toxic feminism and blindly following the west just coz they are cool or whatever is a fool.
Imagine the centuries of social norms that worked and is still working, now the 10 years woke culture of the west is changing and challenging all the social norms of centuries we had.
Think for just a minute and understand what impact it will have on society and country."

"True Feminism means to be equal in every aspect on basis of gender
i.e. to not to be against any person  on basis of gender"
Bhai ye point to hai
Right brother
i thought inequality among men and women had finished
You missed an important point in this video that radical feminism do exist in the society and that's where masculinism come into picture.
very bad video dhruv rathee
Indian drama me hi adarsh baho ka cringe role ziada hota he 😂😂😂
4:50 to 5:30 tak sari baate Islam ke against he..aur sadly Kuch log yahi bate Islam ke sath jur kar Islam ko misinterpret krte he....
i agree to most of your point  but i strongly disagree ki men ko rona chahiye. i used to cry a lot in corner few years back but things are different now and i am happy about it that i can face any situation with a smile or atleast not with a crying face and one more is that if people need change than there should be gender neutral laws in country and harsh non negotiable punishment should be given for mis using these laws
I am not agree with your some content but this is something different and I agree with your many points

Ye to wahi baat ho gyi jese apne pair p hi kulhaari marna partrichal society is bad for both men and women and feminism is good for both but just bcoz feminism looks like it is side of the women men gets offended by it nd dhruv rathe is also the men saying this but difference is that he know what is right or wrong
Sab ka ek solution ho sakta h arthik sahayata economical help

Sari baate sahi h
"Thankyou Dhruv
As a guy, who is a SRK fan, so ofc I have a great respect for womanhood and I love them, I thank u for bringing the truth about feminism 
Toxic feminism or the “false feminism” which is basically a practice of matriarchy in name of feminism is wrong

But feminism isn’t
Every genuine human being, be it a man or a woman is a feminist
Ur personal experience with people might be different but in general u should keep believing in feminism
It’s not a female word, it’s just a word
Just like we call God “He”, Humans “him”, we call male-female equality “feminism”, cuz it sounds the best.
It’s not discrimination,it’s just what sounds the best, so as God,Human is for everyone, feminism is for everyone as well."
So feminists arent really against patriarchal thinking

Thank you so much bro you change my mindset I am a girl but I used to believe in this so called patriarchy but now after see this video I can say that you gave me a great logic to believe in feminism 👍👏🫡
Where can we watch world before her?

"The content is ultimate but I've 2 questions

1. After marriage why bride only lives at in laws place can't groom be stay at his in law place. Isn't it Faiminism?

2. Why can't men deliver babies. If not then how it's feminism.

All logical comments are welcome."
"But dhruv what do you think the police will believe in this case? 

Scene 1 : a girl has filled FIR that I have hit her.

scene 2 : I tell the police the girl is lying and just trying to have personal propaganda. 

Tell me everyone here including ladies, 99% all of you will think the girl is telling the truth? 
Then why am I the man given equal chance to defend or share my story? 

That is where the equal rights are going above man rights in some cases of India now. 

How do we fight that to keep it equal not above nor lower?"
"some man or woman, girls can understand Feminism but mostly misusing of feminism thats why everyone suffer trouble life and no one happy now"
Fire your research team dude. This was the dumbset shit I saw on the internet today
"Dear Druv,

Please make a video on *Cicada 3301* !!!

Thank you..."
"I think there shoud be something between both, if you want to know which religon can fulfil it, just learn Quran.."

All the best Dhruvr Sir 🫡🫡🫡🫡
"Right sir 👍💯 Happy women's day
Kon kon se  08 march 2024 ko ke baad bhi video dekh Rahe hai"
13:20 this type of ideology/thinking is followed in most of the South Indian movies.
"Didn't he claim in one his old videos that ""if feminism is really about equality, then it shouldn't be called feminism"". 
He's a feminist in the most bourgeois sense. His research is literally so watered down. 

The fact he didn't even address the issue of sexuality and its subversion by the patriarchy and the effect of caste on gender power structure, shows how shallow his reasearch is. He doesn't even know about prominent Indian feminist academicians and scholars. This shows how little he actually knows about feminism. 

His research seems to be completely drawn from popular YouTube video one would get when one types ""feminism"". Seriously Dhruv, if you want to talk about feminism bring actual experts and interview them, and stop ranting like a real life version of Bandya from Chup Chup Ke ""mujhe sab pata hai"".
It is so easy for him to actually research a topic properly, and then make a video. He certainly has the means of producing a good video. It is dangerous to see that people think this is a ""good"" video. What has happened to our society? Have we all stopped reading? Or if and when we read its only self help crap like ""Atomic Habits""? 

But, atleast he's using his platform for something good. He should definitely be parised for him in a time when most YouTube creators are literally feet-licking the government."
Just wanna thank you youtube for the english subtitle.The best video I've ever seen It truly changed my mind on certain issues and give me so much information.❤
"i like this

"One fact check pls, first school for girls in India was established by David Hare in Kolkata ... if not an entire school , he at his time approached normal households in Kolkata to send their daughters to his school ...  I may be wrong, would request Mr Rathee to check pls ... thnx"
"The word ""LIMIT"" is important for both men and women"
Very nice information about feminism. Ab please ab ek video equality pr bhi bna dijiye. Pr usme points equality k naam pr jo dono side bhedbhav hote hai unko bhi clear kro. Or dono ko half and half time Dena. Jese ki ladkiyo or ladko k liye equality bs naam k liye hoti hai bhot saare issues me. Is pr ek clear video banaao.
"Feminist:❌
Matriarch:✅"
"Jab metro mai ek thaka aadmi office se ghar lotta hai tab ek ladies ka seat khali rahte vi nehi baith sakta or men ki khali hoti hai o ladies baith jaati hai yeh hai society, stop toxic feminism"
"agree and disagree, Feminism is a political philosophy and ideology, and women's rights is a concept which feminism doesn't have a monopoly on , so you can embody women's rights in a variety of different ways. Anything that is feminism doesn't mean it must be women's rights.
We or I should say I unequivocally believe in women's rights and without any problem.
Equal rights in social, political, and economic.
Men and women are equal in dignity but not identical. For certain thing women are best and for certain thing men are best.
And I believe men should control their emotions as you said opposite of it, cuz emotional men are dangerous to himself, his family and society as they are more tend to do violence or any other stupid things. 
And one more thing I am not alpha, beta, gamma of internet,  just a man believe in a God who has fair-minded approach."

"Baaki sab to thik tha dhruv bhai, lekin jo last wali clips dikhayi thi, pehli baat ye ki social media pe bahut se aese comments pade un video pe jisme ladkiyaan un acts ko support kar rahi thi 
Dusri baat bahut kam ladkiyon k comments mile jo us ladki ko bura bol rahi thi agar ham compare kare ki kisi ladke ki aesi video hoti usse to bahut kam
Baaki jo chiz galat h uske liye mil k lade aur jo chiz sahi h uske liye ek dusre ka support kare to kaafi chize thik ho sakti h aesi meri manyata hai 😇"

But jab road pe Ek Men or Women ka Accident Hota hai toh galti chahe kisi ka bhi ho log Male ko dosh dete hai..... So Feminism say equal rights and opportunities for women as men but practically women ko men se jyada priority diya jata hai na

Only and only respect for you @Dhruv Rathee
"Mr. Rathee Feminist ideology almost destroyed American society from core today where niether man nor women know what there role is anymore and top of that elder people who have way more life experience than you are letting you know that equality among sexes is a childish dream you are still trying to push this stupidity.

But Agenda of feminism and equality can never be achieved since biology always override the progressive leftist thinking whether people like it or not because it doesn't matter how much progressive man or women become their biological desires, wants and needs are not going to change and American society including western society in general is a perfect example of that which you can see in real time right now."

To end wage gap in corporate I suggest we introduce Paternity Leave of 6 months. I think if that is legalized the wage gap will automatically go away.🤔🧐
I always said that I am not feminist and hate feminist people because I have never search the word to know it's meaning by the name I assume that it is in favour of women but after knowing it's meaning I can say proudly I am a feminist
"bruh i support that no one is the same like not all girls are the same and not all men are the same there are some bad people and there are some good people . now its ur choice to pick the right ones and not bad ones. plus y are u wasting ur energy by fighting the wrong ones

quick fact: hinduism is not a patriarchic religion. we have very powerful female goddesses as well and nice. we tell everyone to respect each other. and it doesnt matter which gender, race or caste they are. you give them respect and love and they give you love and respect which is known as karma. we also say that the wife and mothers name is recited first. 
for example: sita-ram, radhe krishna , shakti shiv
for example: sita putra luv-kush
now there are some argues that women are emotionally more expressable and strong where the men are more rational. 
my thoughts are that the above arguements are somewhere correct but not perfectly correct. there is a line between feminism and toxic feminism. so think about it and stay within the lines"

"Why they need women to sell a sofa? And if you see this in western point of view,  to them a woman is only progressive if she shows flesh and wears a skirt, and sits next to men in an office. Only then have they made it. Only then are they liberated. Looking after the children and the home is oppression according to them."

"What does Quran says 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e., Paradise in the Hereafter).” [Al-Nahl 16:97]

“So their Lord accepted of them (their supplication and answered them), Never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female. You are (members) one of another, so those who emigrated and were driven out from their homes, and suffered harm in My Cause, and who fought, and were killed (in My Cause), verily, I will expiate from them their evil deeds and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise); a reward from Allah, and with Allah is the best of rewards” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:195]

“Verily, the Muslims (those who submit to Allah in Islam) men and women, the believers men and women (who believe in Islamic Monotheism), the men and the women who are obedient (to Allah), the men and women who are truthful (in their speech and deeds), the men and the women who are patient (in performing all the duties which Allah has ordered and in abstaining from all that Allah has forbidden), the men and the women who are humble (before their Lord -- Allah), the men and the women who give Sadaqaat (i.e. Zakaah and alms, charity ), the men and the women who observe Sawm (fast) (the obligatory fasting during the month of Ramadaan, and the optional Nawafil fasting), the men and the women who guard their chastity (from illegal sexual acts) and the men and the women who remember Allah much with their hearts and tongues. Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise)” [Al-Ahzaab 33:35]

The reward is same for men and women."
"With regard to the changes in these rights throughout the ages, the basic principles have not changed, but with regard to the application of these principles, there can be no doubt that during the golden age of Islam, the Muslims applied the shari’ah (Islamic law) of their Lord more, and the rulings of this shari’ah include honoring one’s mother and treating one’s wife, daughter, sister and women in general in a kind manner. The weaker religious commitment grew, the more these rights were neglected, but until the Day of Resurrection there will continue to be a group who adheres to their religion and applies the shari’ah (laws) of their Lord. These are the people who honor women the most and grant them their rights. 

Despite the weakness of religious commitment among many Muslims nowadays, women still enjoy a high status, whether as daughters, wives or sisters, whilst we acknowledge that there are shortcomings, wrongdoing and neglect of women’s rights among some people, but each one will be answerable for himself.

And Allah knows best."
"There is no need for us to mention the situation of women in Greek, Persian or Jewish society, but even Christian societies had a bad attitude towards women. The theologians even gathered at the Council of Macon to discuss whether a woman was merely a body or a body with a soul. They thought it most likely that women did not have a soul that could be saved, and they made an exception only in the case of Mary (Maryam – peace be upon her). 

The French held a conference in 586 CE to discuss whether women had souls or not, and if they had souls, were these souls animal or human? In the end, they decided that they were human! But they were created to serve men only. 

During the time of Henry VIII, the English Parliament issued a decree forbidding women to read the New Testament because they were regarded as impure. 

Until 1805, English law allowed a man to sell his wife, and set a wife’s price at six pennies. 

In the modern age, women were kicked out of the house at the age of eighteen so that they could start working to earn a bite to eat. If a woman wanted to stay in the house, she had to pay her parents rent for her room and pay for her food and laundry. 

How can we compare this to Islam which enjoins honoring and kind treatment of women, and spending on them?"
"And Islam honors women as daughters, and encourages us to raise them well and educate them. Islam states that raising daughters will bring a great reward. For example, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever takes care of two girls until they reach adulthood, he and I will come like this on the Day of Resurrection,” and he held his fingers together. (Narrated by Muslim, 2631) 

Ibn Majah (3669) narrated that ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever has three daughters and is patient towards them, and feeds them, gives them to drink and clothes them from his riches, they will be a shield for him from the Fire on the Day of Resurrection.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah)"
"Islam states that the best of the Muslim men is the one who treats his wife in the best manner, and the man is forbidden to take his wife’s money without her consent. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“and live with them honorably” [al-Nisa 4:19] 

“And they (women) have rights similar (to those of their husbands) over them to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise” [al-Baqarah 2:228]

And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I urge you to treat women well.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 331; Muslim, 1468) 

And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you is the one who is best to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3895; Ibn Majah, 1977; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi)"

Not a fan of Dhruv Rathee. But sometimes he makes good videos. This is an example of that. Respect you for this one. 👏Gender should not divide us. Let's grow together boys & girls🤝. Toxic masculinity & toxic feminism is bad for society & future generations.
but the word feminism itself dont gives equality to both the genders
tuze to pta hena? ke tu kitna bda zutha he?
I'm also a feminist not (toxic feminist) and you explained it quite broadly however there is minor logical tilt toward one gender

"The Truth about Feminism | Is Feminism Destroying Indian Society? | Dhruv Rathee

The video discusses the concepts of feminism and patriarchy, emphasizing that feminism aims for political, economic, and social equality between men and women.

It clarifies that feminism does not seek to give women more power than men but strives for equal rights and opportunities.

The video also highlights how patriarchal thinking impacts both men and women, leading to issues such as men's loneliness, pressure to conform to traditional gender roles, and the suppression of emotions.

It addresses the historical context of feminism and its waves, emphasizing the importance of smashing patriarchy for the benefit of both men and women.

The video also critiques the misrepresentation of feminism in certain films and social media, highlighting the need to focus on real feminist issues rather than misconceptions and stereotypes."

But masculine wise men are stronger than women. Who need protection women or men ? Women bcz they are made/ born physically weak..so men are superior than women no doubts, but that doesn't mean to suppress any women, she is equal to a man  in all things..
She is physically made soft and without muscular body ( weak) so as  to begot & to look after her baby..where as man physically made strong to look after both her women and baby..

"Most of the people that call themselves a 'feminist' today, doesn’t even believe in the definition of feminism you used here. They believe that women are superior to men and always shouts with anger about these matters. But, when they gets cornered in an argument they use the traditional and actual definition (which is also used by you in this video) and kinda play a victim. I don't support any theory that considers a particular group of people superior based on their gender. Anyways, if you don't have any agenda to promote any kind of toxicity, just admit that the word 'feminism' is no longer defined in the correct way by most of the so called 'feminists'. If you can't do so then you're just full 💩."
दिल्ली मुम्बई में feminism बहुत है।
Also talk about those negatives of feminism that have started much before. The ways of protesting how it's turned vulgar how they actually end up hating all men and don't follow actual feminism. Feminism term has been destroyed by the self proclaimed feminists themselves
Feminism destroys everything it touches.

Every video is so inspiring & educational. Thanks Dhruv 👍🏻
U r just class apart. U r truly a standard!!!
So Islam is patriarchy according to explanation give by Dhruv rathee.
"People say its thier feminism bcoz those feminsit shoukd have condemend where the girl hit that boy bit they didnt why?? Also same is not the casr if its other way as most men,society and media at karge would have made a big issue if its a boy hitting girl like that on road ...so this is the irony here ....bcoz they want to create a matriachal society not equal society so are the laws and courts in india ....nothing to protect men when people file false cases to extort money ...are you supporting this???"
Also no feminist women would marry a person who doesnt work and who is actually lower than her finacially leave lower they wont marry an equal either so we can stop blabbering about feminisim as women they themsleves dont follow feminism so what the point about equality here ??
More men commit suicide bcoz of women in india jusy check the very own NCRB data you mentioned but you clearly sidelined main issue here
"Males dint have tendency to be voilent but they are built physically in such a way that theu have to do more muscular work or physical activity as they are build like that but current generation making men like women they should be allowed to play more its just how god made us ....if they dont play they dont feel good sbout themselves their growth gets diminished ,they dont have dopamine so tgey feel more streesed these are scientific facts ...jusy check it if you dont believe me"
You are wrong boys do share their hardships with friends but they dont get emitional about it ...may be few get emotional but not majority and all men dont feel shy to share with friends

Men have no hatred , for women, it is The Government having Bias towards A Specific Gender while Making Laws. Is what have caused all this thing. 

Honestly I prefer using The Word EQUALITY  more than feminism 

If Feminsism talks about Equality , then Why do we Use the Prefix Fem for the specific word??? 


So to avoid Any Bullshit , we would Like to Stick the word EQUALITY,  more than Feminism.  Which Gives More Preference to Women than Men, nowdays, as Such mentality has been engraved in the minds of people, the laws made by the government is a clear Indication of that."

Wow very good to understand between patriarchy and faminism 😮
I disagree on this topic this is true that both masculinity and feminity have toxic sides but it's necessary to live like that being stoic shows the bravery of a man and teaches nature isn't soft and girls are misusing the word feminity this world is messed up
Feminism is the biggest comedy in the entire world 😵‍💫
"Unfortunately, the same thing happens to women too ... To not discuss their mental pain, because patriarchy thinks mental health is a taboo."
"Men and women are essentially equal, they should be always treated equally whether at home, workplace etc. Men should not dominate women, but a patriarchal society is needed. We need strong men and the head of the family should be a father. Most often issues and problems can be solved only by men. It's often men who take the initiative to do things. And they don't realise their power. For example, suppose you see a couple kissing in public in India, a woman probably will not be able to say anything against them. But men can. They are the ones that can fights animals( eg: like a snake or even cockroach 😁) . It's true that men shouldn't show emotions. A man who shows emotions is seen as unstable and he tends to do unstable things. Women act on their emotions while men think logically. But I do think men should have someone to confide in like their parents or God. And men fighting with eachother is  alright, if it is for women for their dignity. Otherwise they(men& women) should really learn the saying of Buddha ""He gave me abuses, I didn't take them. So the abuses remained with him"""

Since many of you might be left-adhering people, I know you will call me a BJP supporter, Bhakt and all sorts of names, but I need to admit-

Accountability has increased drastically under the Modi Government, in all sectors- I mean it.

This doesn’t mean I am their supporter. I am highly critical of their economic policies, and many other things. But they have shown outstanding performances in many sectors.

Corruption is one such sector.

Anyways, coming to Rathe issue, know that his father’s businesses were severly affected by the entry of the new government.

Illegal things became rare, I mean in many places, not all. But many. Rules and regulations need to be followed now and you can’t fool the government. That’s a fact.

HIS FATHERS BUSINESS GOT AFFECTED TO CORE.

Demonetization further curbed the black money of thousands. In India’s enemy nation(s), billions of dollars now became mere paper.

Yes, the common civilians suffered to a large extent but the heavy positives, no one highlights.

GST too is one such program which has sucked the hell out of these type

of people.

Just look at his earlier videos. His style is completely like ‘’a child hating the class monitor’’.

Just have a look at his earlier videos.

Even I was affected by the new policies of the modi government. A big part of my own house was brought down by machines. Although it was my fault, since we had encroached upon public land.

I personally observed many of my nieghbours who too were affected similiarly, they became devastatingly critical of BJP.

Maybe its justified, maybe its not. I won’t judge. But this is simply what I observed.

Dhruv knows that if BJP comes down, all those pre-2014 norms will again become common."
I like your videos but I don't like your example of sulman rashdi because  he was not a good person

Being a girl I don't feel staying at home is regressive for women I don't understand why you ppl so adamant for calling it regressive if one is doing so by their own will.
Please make video about those women who say that women don't need men
"Are women biologically more sensitive?

In numerous studies females score higher than males in standard tests of emotion recognition, social sensitivity and empathy. Neuroimaging studies have investigated these findings further and discovered that females utilise more areas of the brain containing mirror neurons than males when they process emotions"

"If feminism is about equality, it  cannot just be about equality of rights, the equality should extend to duties, respect, performance, lifestyle, consumption, expenditure, etc., The fundamental differences are not just physical but also include priorities, capabilities, persistence, etc.,. While the basic human rights should be applicable equally to all, not every thing is a right and should be earned whether it is a man or a woman."
"Thankyou Dhruv for long and much awaited perception of feminism and patriarchy. Especially that a patriarch can be a feminist. Short and concise and to the point. Yet incorporating a world of wisdom! Power to you Dhruv , please keep up your excellent work!! ❤
Looking forward to more of your work. It clears up a lot of clutter!🌹"

"Everything you said is alright.  But at some point it starts appearing that feminism is a sealed compartment like patriarchy and matriarchy are made to appear. 

Is it not possible that a patriarch may at times behave/act as a matriarch or even a feminist and other way round for that matter...!! 

I think it's possible. And no one definition like sizes suits all."

what do you mean by 'Capri boys'  I don't understand.
someone needs to tell these chapri indian so called sigmas that being a real sigma also includes respecting womens and treating them equally

Equality to tab hoga jab jyadatar larki larko respect karenge unke daily hard work and sab kuch apne andar dabake desh ko chalane k lia. Respect denge to respect milega.
Or school,college me marrit k base pe numbers milte hai.
Work me qualification k base pe kam milta hai
Business me mahnat k base pe growth milta hai

"Pink Ek Maha Propaganda Film Hai.

It Took Me Years To Understand That.

It Said, A Female Can Clearly Opt Out From The Deal After Taking Token Money. Because It's Her Right To Deny Accountability.

The Problem Is, Jab Khud Ke Ghar Mein Aag Lagti Hai Tab Pata Chalta Hai Aag Kya Cheez Hai Aur Usko Restrict Kyun Rakha Jaata Hai.

Sad But Yahi Fact Hai. 

And Politics Ya Propaganda, Power Or Rights Given Ke Dynamics Ka Bandarbaant JaanBujh Ke Kiya Jaata Hai Ta Ke Samaaj Mein Kalesh Ho Aur Politicians Faayda Utha Sake.

Women Are Emotional Decision Makers By Nature And Prone To Manipulation. 

Isiliye Unko Pataya Jaata Hai. Emotional Level Par. 

Business Houses Do The Same By Giving Them Discounts.

Even Seeta Ji Was Manipulated By Gold Deer Despite Of The Wise Ram Ji & Laxman.

Koi Bhi Insaan Ek KTM Aur DSLR Se Town Ke 70% Ladki Le Ja Sakta Hai. If It's Okay Then Jo Sahi Lagta Hai Karo. 👍

And Sadly, Samaaj Mein 80% Log Chhapri Hi Hote Hain. IQ Below 75.

And You're Speaking Of Females Like Kalpana Chawla, Laxmi Bai Or Malala Yousafzai."

"ध्रुव राठी जी पृतृसत्ता बुरी नही हैं, समाज ने इस व्यवस्था का अर्थ गलत समझ ले लिया है।।*

याद रखिए – पति और पत्नी के रिश्ते में पति श्रेष्ठ है।

यह व्यवस्था आज के तार्किक सोच रखने वाले लोगों से ऊपर की सोच रखने वाले *साधु और संतों* ने की है। 

दूसरी बात – जिस पितृसत्ता को आप इतना बुरा बता रहे हैं, अगर यह पितृसत्ता की मानसिकता हट जाए तो, ... *तो समाज का नाश होने में ज्यादा दिन नही लगेंगे।*
Ex.–  लड़कियां भौतिक रूप से पुरुष जैसे नही है।

याद रखिए –

*संतुलन बनाए रखने किए हमेशा दो चीजों का आपस में बराबर होना ही जरूरी नही है, कभी कभी एक दूसरे का कम या ज्यादा होने से भी सतुलन बनाए रखता है।।*"

"m ur huge fan but i do not accept with you on animal and this video... do not accept as in u r best at informative vidz but this doesn't apply i guess..

abhi ladkiya bhot badal chuki hai... ladko ko ladkiyo ki approval k liye wait karna padra hai, m not saying it is bad but since they became independent, they do not know what is right or wrong, they just go by society which u said, even parents are not able to say anything to their daughters.... for example: they are looking for irrelevant package guys, expecting handsome guys just to show off.... if they get bald guy rishta, immediately her friends will say tu itni padayi padd kar ganje se shadi kyu karegi and unki baton me ake ladkiya are rejecting gems and then marrying some random guy, if they don't like it, they complain, go away to parents, file fake cases, charge money, spoil life of that guy and going away just like that... ye bhi tho chalra hai society me... n btw i commented on animal wali video as well!! i don't think that movie was any bad, usse bhi gandi movies ayi hai india me, sabse highest visiting website porn site hai india me, then animal and kabir singh movie is nothing comparatively js bcos bada star hai, u got to make vidz on that...!! make something which excites us... like anti bhajpa 😂"

"Four more shots and others films as such aren't about feminism, they just mislead the societal women into shit, these types of series are just for normalizing the 'slut-culture' for females. And then after the characters are done whoring around, they say a thing or two to men and call it a day. 

They don't support gender equality-""FEMINISM! FEMALE RIGHTS! MALE RIGHTS!""
They just follow the western dis-culture and attract audiences of 12-24 brainwashing them. 

Four types of feminism- liberal feminism, Marxist feminism, socialist feminism, and radical feminism...these types of series promote none of them is none of them.

Feminists like Florence Nightangle, Christine de Pizan, Mary Wollstonecraft, etc never promoted the feminism these shows want to show us. 

Feminism doesn't mean- ""HEY YOU'RE THE MAN, YOU DO THE HOUSE-WORK! I WON'T COOK FOR YOU! I WON'T FEED YOUR KIDS! I'LL GO TO PARTIES AND SLEEP WITH RANDOM PEOPLE! I'M A QUEEN!""

It means- ""I'll go to work too""  ""I'll be home by 7""   ""I'll do the dishes you do the clothes""   ""I earned this much today!""   ""Wow! Son, you got 100? I'll take you to McD with my own salary!"" ""We're both humans""  ""Dad I won the first prize in the race!""

Feminism- stands for equal rights for both men and women...Sadly, teens and dank-memer shits don't know the meaning and mis-lead the society.

Ofc, physically and emotionally they can't be the same, God gave boobs to women and a dick to man, they're different...They shouldn't run in the same race, but they should have a separate race where both run, not only one.

As a women, i just wanna be out of the party....Not taking sides of the male gender or the female gender but of an individual person.
Gender doesn't define you as a person, your character does...

If you're a shit man, you'll be shit as a women... If you're a shit women, you'll be shit as a man. Conc- you're shit"

"In that era also women belittled their own gender and it’s the same today. One woman’s victory is other woman’s sorrow. I hope these dumb head women change for good and try to support each other. Men are not our enemies, we women ourselves pull each other’s leg and blame it on men. For example, a mil telling a dil- you need to wear these kinds of clothes else your fil will get upset.. what a hypocrite.

Thanks Dhruv"
He always talks sense… he says the things which often comes to my mind.

"11:06 Indian Judicial system publicly asking men to beg, borrow or steal but pay maintenance and alimony to wife. Another side CJI giving lecture on equality before law😂"
Then please conclude it by Marriage is an patriarchial mindset and without marriage hook ups is an feminist mindset.  Expression of male and female both changes with the mindset. Therefore there is no meaning of marriage for those humans who are feminists. Please make one video about the probability of loyalty is there in the belief of husband wife and boyfriend girlfriend relations?

"A strong  independent man in his own rights, doesn’t need to oppress or suppress his partner or wife ; The same for a Women, both have similar values that work together as a team . At times he will push forward in his career and she may choose to do the same establishing a career before stepping back to raising children. Then she may move forward and he supports her equally in her career goals so they  tag team as a win for their family. Both have vale , no one greater than the other as we all have different strengths. 
  Hearing a man throwing acid on a woman is narcissistic evil that has no place in any society. Clearly he wasn’t raised correctly and like his parents harbour similar traits."

"How would you explain women labeling men being masculine as toxic masculinity? I would agree with your last statement. Both parties are hypocrites, in the modern world, you can never truly support anyone, cuz everyone is faulty from multiple aspects."
Ladki nhi aye jinadgi me koi baat nhi I'm patriarchy 💞hak se .
"I hope you continue to inspire men of Indian society to think and act free from inhibition and peer pressure. I'll surely introduce my son to your videos when he's old enough. Keep helping the few logical Indians to stay on the right path, be it politically or morally.... Thanks @dhruvrathee"
I'm a feminist 😊
After rhis video my thought is very clear
"How about Dalit act & reservation in the present days ?
Fair enough or not.

Olden days have gone.
We certainly need new laws to suit present days."
When you are talking about Feminism how you can forget Dr.B.R . Ambedkar
ap ka har video full informative hota ha. lakin ap sirf wahi facts dekaty ho jisy ap support karty ho. ap ny Feminism k dis advantiges nai bataye.

जिस प्रकार feminism exist करता हैं उस प्रकार menism क्यू नही होता????
"Now feminism is only valid in society. 
Females already have equal rights according to law. Maybe more."
Agar feminist ki bat aati h to hm B R ambedkar sahan ko bhi feminist keh sakte h kyunki unhi badolat india ma aaj jo india me womens rights h @dhruvrathee

"On most issues I agree with Druv Rathee, but here, Dhruv is going with the flow(feminism wave) to sound liberal and broad-minded. 
Using cheap falacies to cover his illogical arguments .... Disappointing Druv Bhai!"
"In my view, feminist ko equality bhi kahe sakta hee ,mere khayal see name meee gadabad heee yeee name change hoo Jay gaaa oor ausake characteristics same Hoge tooo logo kooo gayda samaj aay gaa, varana yee log loko kooo aesa hii manipulate karate rahaga"

You are a hero❤
"Men and women can't be equal physically, its nature we can't do anything about it"
All right equal to men or women but only women have reseveration 😢 so women have more reservetion . I think that constitution gave equal rights to men or women but not gave reservation to anyone.
Sach ko is tarah sabko dikhane k liye shukriya ❤

🔴Today's reality is totally different females are more powerful than men and men's are more suffering than women through the so called feminism and Indian judiciary system (I am not against of feminism but rights should be equal in society and laws for both male and female)

"This time I don't agree with you sir .
Men and women cannot be equal.
Men don't leave their parents after marriage. Don't change their home.
But a girl has to leave her house, parents to start a new life. 
Then how can they both be equal."

"you are right about feminism..but at the same time you can't deny that the word ""feminism"" caused more misconceptions amongst girls..not every woman/girl is an ideal feminist as you said...girls use the term ""feminism"" and do the wrong use of it..nowadays they went to live alone because it's their right and causes growing po*n industries and social media's semi nudity...even in india the word ""feminism"" is misleading the girls more..since these fake feminist women's  number are higher than real feminist woman then why didn't you include those girls in your video...?? I agree chapri boys exist but you also must agree that girls use ""feminism"" wrongly..and this is the main problem..this should be the topic of the video.."

"Feminist did not show any support to the hypocrisy by Neha Dhupia  = BJP did not support any violence by ""bhakts"".

dhruv rathee expects BJP to CONDEMN the cruel violence by bhakts  = men expecting feminist to CONDEMN hypocrisy by neha dhupia.

this is same as : wife's mother in aw behaved like an ass but wife is mad at her husband because he did not CONDEMN  his moms act rather he just kept silent (or DID NOT SHOW support TO  his mom).

I am a political science student still could never understood the core concept of feminism. Today in this 25 minutes video I cleared my concept of feminism. Thank you Rathee bhai
Hello sir kash aapse mil paata
This is one of the best things that exists on the internet 👌👌👌
Serials dekhne ke karn mere friends log v aise hi krte h
"Yes, those criminals call for penal action who throws acid in a woman's face. But what about those 'arrogant elite class ki auratein' jo mere jaise mediocre class ke kisi ladke ko asahay karke ussko depression mein bhugoke usska outlook chinnle phir foreign jaake dusre ek mard ke sath ghar basaye aur waha se bhi conspiracy kare taaki usska baki zindagi bhi barbaad ho jaaye! But I don't understand that why you are saying there is no feminism in India. Women are equally paid for the same position in any organisation whether it is government or private. I am also a victim of this patriarchy thinking. But what the established women of this society are doing? have they become empathetic to me?? badsurat aurat ka shadi hona muskil hai lekin bekar mard ko kaun leta hai? ek mard aurat ko sahara na de to woh kharab hai par meri bhabi jaisi  swarthi established aurat jab apne se zyada yoggata hold karne wale mard ko bole' mujhe kya pata main kya karoon?', tab uss neech soch ke khilaf koi mu nahi uthathe balki mujhe duffer banane ke liye kya nahi karr rahe sab!!! 'mard ko dard hota hai..yakeen mano inn neech swarthi aurato se kahi zyada dard hota hai'! yes true! males ko apne depression apne paas hi rakhne ke liye majboor kiya jata hai, mujhse accha koi nahi jannta ye. crime aurat se zyada mard karte hain lekin 'depression mein suicide' bhi mard aurat se zyada karte hain!👍👍👍"

"Actually the true essence of feminism is more misunderstood by women than men of PRESENT ERA. Right to vote and equal opportunities (even more in form of reservation whether it's any kind of examination or public transport) are being enjoyed by them.
However, still when a man do something unethical, they copy. If someone denies them to do the same, they take it as the violation of their Right to Equality.
Today's woman wants to use the word 'Feminism' as the license of doing anything a man can do, even if it degards their own social standards."

"Al Qur'an chapter 16..✅💯✌️
57. And they attribute to Allah daughters exalted is He - and for them is what they desire [i.e.. sons].

58. And when one of them is informed of [the birth of] a female, his face becomes dark, and he suppresses grief.

59. He hides himself from the people because of the ill of which he has been informed. Should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the ground? Unquestionably, evil is what they decide.

Thankyou so much I Learn a Lot about Feminism & Patriarchy 🤗
Thank you for making this video. I feel feminism has become a toxic word because of a lack of awareness about this term. Most people learn the definition of feminism through so-called social media influencers who don't know the meaning of feminism or are immature in the first place. It's more of an EDUCATIONAL and AWARENESS video about it's true meaning.

Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women and tasked with supporting them financially. And righteous women are devoutly obedient and, when alone, protective of what Allah has entrusted them with.1 And if you sense ill-conduct from your women, advise them ˹first˺, ˹if they persist,˺ do not share their beds, ˹but if they still persist,˺ then discipline them ˹gently˺.2 But if they change their ways, do not be unjust to them. Surely Allah is Most High, All-Great."

"This video script explores the concepts of feminism and patriarchy, debunking misconceptions and highlighting the importance of gender equality. It addresses the impact of patriarchal thinking on both men and women and emphasizes the need for a society that values equal rights and opportunities for all.
Highlights
•	0:00-1:26 🎬 The script introduces the topic and addresses the question of whether feminist films are bad for society.
•	1:27-4:10 🌍 The definitions of feminism and patriarchy are explained, emphasizing the fight for equality rather than women having more power than men.
•	4:11-8:58 🚻 The script discusses the division between patriarchal and feminist ideologies, the social conditioning that contributes to patriarchal views, and the role of media in perpetuating regressive stereotypes.
•	8:59-12:52 👥 The script explores historical examples of women opposing equal rights and the existence of patriarchal thinking among some women.
•	12:53-16:30 ⚖ The impact of patriarchal thinking on men is discussed, highlighting issues such as unemployment pressure, height-related stereotypes, and the normalization of violence.
•	16:31-18:14 😔 The script addresses men’s loneliness as a consequence of patriarchal norms and societal expectations.
•	18:15-19:56 👀 The importance of challenging patriarchal thinking and promoting gender equality is emphasized, with examples of male celebrities who openly identify as feminists.
Key Insights
•	💡 The fight for gender equality is not a battle between men and women, but rather between patriarchal and feminist ideologies.
•	💡 Patriarchy is a social system where men have control over women, while feminism seeks political, economic, and social equality for all genders.
•	💡 Social conditioning plays a significant role in perpetuating patriarchal views, even among women.
•	💡 Media, including TV serials and films, often reinforce regressive stereotypes and ideals of an “ideal woman” that conform to patriarchal norms.
•	💡 Historical examples show that women have also opposed equal rights due to societal pressures and internalized patriarchal thinking.
•	💡 Patriarchal thinking negatively impacts men, including pressures related to employment, height, and societal expectations of aggression.
💡 Challenging patriarchal norms and promoting gender equality benefits both men and women, as evidenced by male celebrities who openly identify as feminists."

"The problem with education is the cost.
My elder sister wasted huge amounts of my father's money to get bachelors degreee in a private university and at the end of the day she got married and is now a housewife with 2 kids.
Now my father is having difficulty to pay for my education. I don't have the option to marry rich without being rich and established myself."

You can look at the comments by men to see how this video had zero impact
"Dhruv sir I think men and women's both are equal but in other ways for example men are physically strong and women's are emotionally strong this kinds of things are given by nature...after marriage men cannot leave his house but women can...this is not that man cannot do like that,,but when man can marry a woman is similar that a man are capable to care of her responsibility..both are equal both have their right, but this time some women are Miss using their right due to that money other women are faced ther problem....😊😊😊😊😊"

"Both males and females are treated equally and have equal opportunities, as indicated in the following Quranic verses: Surah Al-Imran, verse 195, and Surah An-Nisa, verse 124. These Quranic verses demonstrate that Islam does not support discrimination or differentiation based on gender in the pursuit of achievements"
"Its not like all femists are fake, i love the video and it really taught me allot, but i had some points too.
1. Not all femists are saints. The feminist movement is in the gutter due to most of these people.
2. Its just not that female and male anatomy is different. There are several emotional and physical differences in both the genders.
3. Female uprising in on the skies and any opinion made against it, the person is cancelled.
We need to understand that there is toxic feminism and we also need to understand that the feminists of now dont really understand that they are equal and they need to stop fighting"
Toxic feminism is as bad as toxic masculinity.. men & women have separate roles & both should be treated fairly & equally. Tipping to either side of the balance scale is deleterious to human society..
"The Defintion of feminism doesn't matter it is a matriarchy by action even if it is not by definition. There is no need to divide us into teams to have common sense. Call it humanism if you want, feminism is a bad religion and most people in it are intolerant of others. If I wanted that I'd just join the BJP.

Acceptance paane ke liye feminism bhi choose kartha bhai"
"Being a woman I don’t not support feminism, feminism is satanic created word just to make woman crazy 😅and to destroy the world right rules….

Sir 'feminism' hona chahiye lekin ek had tak poori tarah nahi....
"@dhruvrathee. You have to study more about  this issue. Here you made to please both men and women.. See women should not have voting rights, why because they are not or aware or interested in politics. When they go for voting they ask someone else who should they vote for. Women not involved any war.
And natural thing is women always look for more in men than themselve, if women is educated or have high paid job so they look for more paid men than them. So high paid women likely remain single or get divorced easily. In west 90	%educated women initiate divorce. One more thing I will tell you, imagine if you are convicted for false murder case and you are in court, and judge is a women in her periods. Will you wish her to say your judgement on that day?   Can you do study how in Islam how they men and women are given power legally. Can you do a video on that. Because I heard that in court while give witness if women giving witness there should be two women, and when men give witness only one man is enough"

"I appreciate the video essay as it puts through the rational points without much fluff. I would like to add though, as what the film critics mentioned in the video talked about the 'feminist' movies, which I would wish to, by extension, expand on:
Back when I used to spend some time on my anonymous account on Twitter, I did realize there were quite a few people who basically were parodying feminism like how those 'alpha males' believe it is, while being serious too with their thoughts. And then there are also people who would just slap themselves the label of being a feminist, simply as a means to get validation (and maybe some internet romance) from other feminists, genuine or otherwise. This exactly makes me not want to identify myself as one, simply because of the self-anointing thing; like let the person's actions speak, not the person themselves. If someone else calls you one, consider it an honor, but not when you introduce yourself as one; that just adds more suspicion if one really is a feminist or just seeking validation while being irrational towards the situation.
Other than that, thank you for the video essay. I do hope it reaches more to people to really understand how they think with situations involving genders is absolutely wrong, on both ends of the spectrum. And I also wish that feminism gets its original meaning back and not be associated with matriarchy to the uninitiated, instead of them blazing guns at each other for who they are."

"As per this logic every father should teach his boy that he is rapist and dnt be. Do good. 

Read below comment. Feminism is not about etc etc. And do like it. Reality is while educating the feminism, reality is many people normal people are tagged as criminals by court. Thats feminism. Now let's support feminism, make rules without thinking anything because males in india are rapist and only good gender is female. Male is wrong. So to sum up kudos. Lets educate feminism to community while accepting feminist penal codes. Males are so stupid and they are not going to wake up because few of them did rape. 😅 And if male suffer, we dnt come on the road to support him. We will blame him. On the other hand every woman will come to support a woman. Thats a difference. We as males assume male is shit ans rapist. Thats all.

And we as males believe dhruv. We accept that we as males only do bad things. Females are so inferior. Its so wrong man. There are ppl who are in jail for fake harrasment cases. Etc. What the hell is wrong with us."
I think everyone would understand if it is called equalism rather than feminism which creates confusion

"You’re trying to be a social constructionist, Dhruv. A lot of the men’s rights issues are innate and have biological and evolutionary underpinnings. Men get into more physical fights because we are biologically nore agressive, this is not a patriarchal  oppression, it’s biology.

Wanting a taller husband with more money? Well obviously , if you are going to be pregnant for 9 months and multiple  times, you would want some to be able to protect you, maybe not that much anymore, and provide for you in those years that you can’t. This is not a patriarchal insistence, it’s decided by the women because it's  what is best for them."

"I totally agree. One point however is related to equal pay for equal work. I agree 100% that people doing the same amount of work should be paid equally. Problem comes in defining what constitutes equal work. Take the example of tennis. Men's and Women's tennis are both equally popular. However, Men's tennis gets more revenue as they are longer. So what would equal pay for equal work mean for tennis. Or say something as simple as a software engineering. How is work defined? Is it hours put in? Lines of code? A lot of service sector jobs where output is not easily measured runs into this issue."

For a better & progressed society we need more feminist men to fight against patirachy and toxic masculinity
You didn't talk about 'toxic feminism' and how that has diverted from the real issues
🎉Congratulations dhruv rathi. 15 million family❤
"I think we need Faminists (advocates of family) and not feminists. 

The way feminism that Dhruv tries to present here, practically  is seldom seen in the society.
Feminists are practically seen as womens rights advocated only.

Now, do men enjoy any constitutional rights that women does not have? No.

Did any feminists support Neha Dhupia? No.
But the question is also did any feminist deplore Neha Dhupia? The answer to that is also a no to my knowledge. 

The same thing on the Lucknow case. No feminists came to support the boy.

The same feminists, cite the reason of family pressure and leave early from the work,  but also cringes when the hard working man is given a raise or promotion.

So, i would prefer to be a faminist..."
Wait for reply mufti yasir Naseem al wajdi😊😊😊😊
Absolutely right
You guys demand equality unless it’s mandatory military drafts
"Well book definition of feminism and actual feminism on ground are different. It’s naive to say feminism hasn’t changed from its original goals. Feminism is not driven by a small set of intellectuals today as it’s no more a new idea but by society. Currently it looks like a women’s advocacy movement. I am not saying feminism shouldn’t exist but it should be called out and shamed when deviating from its original goals which is “women and men should have equal opportunities in economic, political, and social life”


People now go for equality of outcome than equality of opportunity. When Alia Bhat in Gully Boy picks up a bottle and hits a women no one has a problem but when a guy slaps a girl in Kabir sing or thappad suddenly it’s so toxic. Movies are for entertainment and they aren’t fact books. Art is generally called liberal arts as it can be used to express whatever you want throwing political correctness out the window. It’s just surprising that liberals now argue for political correctness and censorship for movies and tv shows"

"Nature did not create men and women equally, so they never be equal rather nature give them unique features. therefore, in some cases women do better similarly in some cases men do better. So, he/she must be a fool who compares them because there is no comparison at all!
 But we, the humans, created a rule book to live in this world and in this rule book every person should have equal rights -- which we call feminism."
that's why need socialism for a better world

I understand that you made mention of those famous people's comments after giving you definition of feminism but most people would just gloss over it and thus i have to make view of some of my points.

The definition of feminism has changed over the years by the upcoming generations. The current definition of feminism is to have more rights then men, is if women don't succeed to make it the fault of men, is if men bring out their problems then to imply we don't understand women, is if a wrong deed is pointed out by a man to tag him  as a person who doesn't believe men and women are equal, and a lot more than cannot be listed here. While many of these people you mentioned do believe in feminism they believe in the women having rights to education, opportunities and so on. 

It is true that there was no right to education before to almost all women but that has changed now and women do have the right to education, they even have reservation but let us not talk about that for now. The women who don't have a right to education come from rural households. In most of these households the men are uneducated too. The problem there is the lack of awareness provided by the government among other institutions. But the CURRENT FEMINISTS would blame it on the patriarchy and what not instead of the main concern that is awareness

Almost women these days have opportunities these days equal to men or sometimes more than men. Again the women who do not have opportunities are from rural sectors of the country who are not aware of what opportunities are out there in the country. It is also of the strict traditions of these rural families that have yet to be broken due to the conservative nature of us Indians.

If we speak about crime equality then while there are so many rapes on females taking place around the country there are a negligible number on men as well. NOW by stating this i am not saying i don't understand what women go through or that i condone anything related to women being tormented but men not being tormented. ALL i am stating is that WE are aware of women getting raped but unaware of men getting raped. If a rape case is made/complained to the police station it is a law that the accused man is to be thrown in jail first before any investigation is conducted. And hence women make use of this to frame men for rape, assault and various other crimes. AGAIN, i am not stating that these crimes do not happen i am stating that the severity of these crimes are being taken advantage of by some women and being used against men.

ALL in all, my point being that the definition of feminism has changed over the years by the general public. The video was basically of the past of feminism but not of the current feminism. Kindly bring into the light all of the current feminism issues and problems.
Thank You!"

"Dhruv Bro, if feminism is really about equality, then can you give an example of a time when feminist groups have agitated against a woman who falsely implicated any man? Why do they do all those candle and flag marches for women's issues only when they are about gender equality? Now don't tell there are no false rape charges, false dowry cases. These false cases do happen and the heads of Woman's commission have admitted to these..

Please don't peddle the feminist agenda being a man. You are making a big fool of yourself."

For the first time i like ur video Dhruv as ur info make me really clear about what real feminism is and why it is important for both female and male . Thank u ❤
Ye such hai ke har insan ko sirf gender se nahi balke uski personality ke according treat karna chahiye log samajhte sab mard kamaane ke liay peda hote aur aurtein ghar mein rehne ke liay aur jab kuch log iss mein fit nahi ho paate to wo depressed ho jate hein aur kuch suicide tak kar lete hein.
Is there any way to block this channel from my YouTube... Seriously....
Listening to Swetabh and coming here through him I felt bhot hi ghatiya video h ye. Kya yrr Dhruv thoda sahi se research karke banao video. Tha kya ye?
Jis tarha mard equal nahi hote phir bhi equal rights demand kiay jaate jo ki ghalt hai for example an illiterate should not be considered an equal to a literate when voting same as a 9 year old should not be allowed to do certain things even if he is as tall as his father in that age. So how can men and women can be equal.

"You very smoothly moved around the actual question which was opion on ' Radical feminism ' and not just 'Feminism' as the idea of Feminism has been influenced by Radical feminism and also male loneliness is a resultant of Radical Feminism and not Patriarchy as radical feminists are the ones to promote casual sex and non commitment based relationships whereas conservatives do the exact opposite to that . Your video wasnt clear as u only highlighted the good part of Feminism and not the dark side of it which was the original question about , its dark side not the good part . Its just like the whole Alpha male bs where they just highlight good parts of being a fboy and not tell u the negatives . Your opinion isnt any better if u didn't talk about the negatives . At best ur opinion is incomplete or staright up stupidly simplified and off topic"

"फेमिनिज्म की आइडियोलॉजी मेल- फीमेल के बीच इक्वल राइट्स के लिए एक अच्छी सोच से समाज में लाया गया था लेकिन छपरी फेमिनिस्टो के हरकतों ने इसे इस तरह से पोट्रेट किया कि फेमिनिज्म मेल हैरेसमेंट और वूमेन को ओवर पावर करने वाली आइडियोलॉजी ज्यादा लगने लगी हैं। लोग फेमिनिज्म का समर्थन तब करेंगे जब ये फेमिनिस्ट जेंडर न्यूट्रल होंगे। फेमिनिज्म का वूमेंस के तरफ इंक्लिनेशन साफ दिखता हैं। ये फेमिनिस्ट तब कहां जाते है जब कोई वूमेन किसी मेल को हैरेस करती हैं कानून का गलत फ़ायदा उठाकर? तब ये कोई प्रोटेस्ट नही करते कोई आवाज़ नही उठाते लेकिन वहीं कोई मेल किसी वूमेन को हैरेस करता हैं तब तो बड़ा आवाज़ उठाते हैं। ज्यादातर फेमिनिस्ट जेंडर बायस्ड होते हैं।
ध्रुव सर आपने कहा ""क्या फेमिनिस्ट ने नेहा धूपिया को सही कहा- नहीं "" okay सही तो नही कहा लेकिन गलत भी कब कहा? कोई गलत होते देख कर चुप रह जाना आपकी तटस्थता नहीं दर्शाता हैं बल्कि उस गलत काम के प्रति आपकी मौन सहमति दर्शाता हैं और इसे समझने की जरूरत हैं।
आज फेमिनिस्ट इसे जैसा पोट्रेट कर रहे हैं उसे देख के समाज में बदलाव की मानसिकता कम और समाज से बदले की मानसिकता ज्यादा नजर आता हैं। बदला कभी भी बदलाव नही ला सकता। सिर्फ पोजीशन ही बदलेगी। आज का तानाशाह कल का शोषित और आज का शोषित कल का तानाशाह, बस इतना ही बदलाव लाता हैं बदले की भावना। इसलिए फेमिनिस्टो को बदले की नहीं बल्कि बदलाव की सोचना चाहिए। वूमेन वूमेन की रट लगाने के बजाय हर डिस्क्रिमिनेशन के खिलाफ आवाज उठाए चाहे वो आदमी के लिए हो या औरत के लिए, चाहे  आदमी के खिलाफ जाना पड़े या चाहे औरत के खिलाफ। तभी हम कहेंगे फेमिनिज्म महिला-पुरुष दोनों के समान अधिकार के लिए है अन्यथा ये महिलाओं को ओवर पावर कर आदमी के खिलाफ तानशाही की आइडियोलॉजी से ज्यादा कुछ नही।"

"In the definition of feminism( 2:00 ), as provided by Cambridge Dictionary, it is assumed that men are better placed than women in society.

Thank you so much Druv bhaiya
You maded a good video about gender equality. We all should support feminism. Gender equality is very important in this modern society which is not really modern but now everyone should have equal rights.
1st tym i find a really good video from this channel
bro thanks for this video people really need these kind of knowledge all over the world
Totally agree with him every word is correct😌
Tum kaun se doodh ke dhule ho 😎😎😎👍👍
"Not only pregnancy when we talk about strength than man again dominate.  However, the conversation While promoting equality in terms of rights and opportunities is crucial, fostering clashes between men and women isn't desirable. Some argue if we wanna test equality so  arrange matches or contests between men and women in sports like WWE etc , & it's rare to see a country with a 100% female army, many nations have predominantly male armies.

 We often compare men and women in education and other professions, but not in sports. It's important to recognize that true feminism lies in acknowledging the value of women and treating them with equal respect and rights not in terms of strength and not also toxic feminist both are condemnable.

My view is Promoting respect and providing space for both males and females is crucial. Unfortunately, in today's society, there is some hate spreading between both sides due to certain psychological factors affecting both men and women & causing damaging our social & cultural values . Encouraging understanding, empathy & cooperation can help mitigate these tensions & foster a more harmonious environment where both genders are valued and respected"

"People only see things in Black and white, they don't consider the shades of grey; for example- mens' genetic makeup makes them more taller, aggressive and less emotional than women, but there are shorter men who exist; there are men who are emotional... and the degrees vary from man to man, but they are excluded from the society due to this patriarchal mindset...."

"The world is divided into 2 kinds of men
Men who are achievers,have careers,jobs etc and obviously woman 
Others are having no career therefore no wife,no family.
In return they turned themselves as sigma male and started misogyny,insteat of seeing their own faylt,they blame women who are more achievers than them and also those men whom these women select."
"I appreciate your insights on feminism and equal rights in your video. While advocating for equal rights is crucial, it's equally important to address how feminism can be misused to pressure women into conforming to stereotypical male traits, which has created another type of social conformity problem.

Your video emphasizes the need for equal rights, and you have highlighted some examples of misconception about feminism but it overlooks the risk of misuse that can encourage women to emulate male characteristics, including those that are detrimental not only to women but those are detrimental even to men for men having them in the first place - such as irrational aggression and exerting irrational dominance – damaging the natural dynamics between genders. This is just one of the causes of the increased divorce rate; both genders are gradually becoming unwilling to marry, leading to an increase in loneliness. David Deida's 'The Way of the Superior Man' supports this perspective, emphasizing the unique energies of both genders and the disruption caused by losing core energy.

The video should also explore how feminism has become a tool to manipulate women, devaluing activities associated with femininity. This bias, perpetuated by societal pressure, not only affects women but also reinforces the notion that only certain paths, like pursuing a career, hold value. The examples of women being astronauts, scientists, etc., are more highlighted, traditionally male-dominated roles. However, a woman who may willingly want to stay at home or pursue feminine activities feels the pressure of this new social conformity to pursue such male-dominated career paths; only then would she be considered a part of this new phenomenon. This coerced conformity can result in dissatisfaction and a loss of authenticity as individuals pursue paths incongruent with their true desires.

In conclusion, while advocating for equal rights, I request that you make a video addressing the inadvertent consequences of misusing feminism. Promoting a nuanced understanding can create a society that embraces the diversity of choices available to both men and women"

"Druvrathee how would you make sense when you will justify the fack feminism by the theory of real feminism... 

Feminism of the theory doesn't exist on the ground if it does then that too just on a very small level...

And fack feminism is only what Mostly exist on the ground which must go in both your's and mine openion...

Then when we reject feminism then it's very obvious we are rejecting fack feminism because that only exist the most on the ground not the real one...

The theory of feminism may be correct on it's way but how  the propaganda running in the name of feminism is correct ..."
"Sorry but some people says right you are really a manipulative man.
1) You didn't mention fake rape, domestic violence and dowry case.
2) You didn't mention about any laws which are made for men because there are none.
3) Even an educated and well earning girl will not marry a man earning low than her(exception are exception).
4) There is a video where a person asked question from a group of girl ""will you date a unemployed man or not"" and only one girl said yes while other said no, and all of them were in modern outfit and well educated.
5) If both husband and wife are earning and wife lose her job or thought to do something else she will not face any problem, and when men will go through the same there is a good chance that his wife will leave him.
6) Men are always traditional whether they marry housewife or working women, but women are only traditional when she is housewife, those men will still protect feminist wife and do their traditional part, think yourselves will any woman marry a man who do not come to pick her up at 10-11 pm, will she marry a man who do not protect her??


The main problem is women are only following feminism in terms of education and earning, nothing else, no woman will marry a man who can not protect her and provide her, FULL STOP."

"Yeah Equal rights is a good thing. but when we see quotas for women and stuff like that. that is an issue.. that's not equal rights.... and it should not be a problem to speak the truth. Here are some  truths 
1. women are generally and largely physically weaker than men.
2. Women are not suitable for wars. Only men should be allowed to go to the frontline in a war.
3. Generally men choose stem fields more than women do.
4. Men and women sports should always be seperate. otherwise women teams won't be able to win. even in games like chess men and women should have seperate events.
5. I agree on equal rights thing. but saying that women can do whatever men are doing that is a lie. a big lie. 
6. Women are different. but equal. there is no denying that women and men are different. but we should give equal rights to all."

"Men do hard physical labour
Men have to earn as a responsibility
Men cannot be househusband by choice.
Men can physically fight
Men are emotionally stronger

Women produce generations
Women raise children.
Women built society
Women teach better
Women are more creative.
Women are emotionally weak.

Both genders not just physically differ but their brains differ as well. This in patriarchy but accepting the reality of nature. Otherwise abolish the rule of ""Women and Children First"". These sorts of opinions may appear cool but lack rational grounds. Though some of the areas can be worked upon for improvement, still equating both genders to absolute would be injustice with nature."

"Men and women are made differently by nature that is why they react to one situation differently, it is natural.
We can discuss as much we like but situation reaction can not be changed.
even two males and females react differently."
"The concept of balanced power among men and women suits well. 

But in my view the society is already towards females, or atleast working for females more than males. Atleast in education, ladakiya jyada padd pa rhi he, unke liye women's college he, transportation me, in Delhi DTC buses ka fare 0 he for females not for males, form filling fees bhi half or 0 he for females. 

There is a dark site also in marriages, marriage me divorce me wife ko husband ka kuch %age wealth milata he, society ka support jyada milata he, females ke liye laws jyada he (I don't understand men's law, gender laws kyun nahi banaye gye he in reality). Misuse and abuse of laws for monetary purpose or cheating by women, adultery inke cases ko prove krna mushkil he, ladaki Dahej ka yah koi allegation lagakr bach skti he. Ek case me internet pr suna tha ki ek husband jis bachhe ko paal rha, voh spouse ka DNA test krakr check nahi kr skta ki uski wife ne cheat kra, ki bacha uska hi he yah kisi aur ka. Khulla cheating ka scope and loopholes and misuse ke cases dikhatey by females on Internet. Just view the video ""Martyres of Marriage"" video. Iska jawab kon dega??"
"Hey Dhruv, you are defenitly driven by WEF ideology that you are unnoticed to get corrected. See! If you could see the current US is getting more into LGBTQ++ ideology! If you want to compare then choose feminism vs inequality or sensitivity vs masculinity or Patriarchy vs Matriarchy. You are comparing wrongly with feminism vs Patriarchy. Hereafter there is WEF elites are not want us to think of it as feminism vs something, brace for the real impact it should be ""Family vs LGBTQ+"" ideology. Forget about outdated topic, men already doomed with the shit ideology and became weak, who will speak against the weakening of family syystem? And one more thing you never explicitly spoke about how the movies from 1980's are turning to push the LUST and making the men weaker and deprived, I suggest don't listen from toxic feminists."
"If feminism is all about equality then why males have to do all the dirty and dangerious works. In the present Ukrain-Russia war, men are dying in thousands like KFC chickens while their wives and daughters are parting all night in clubs in Europe and Thailand with compensation money of dead husbands and sons.  Instead of the word feminism, we need to use the word equality. The so-called modern feminism is all about male bashing and discouraging women to remain single. These feminists are actually big time scammers of the 21st century."

Patriarchy is not wrong, wrong use of it is, just as religion is never the problem, it is those who use it to gain power.
Awareness on equity over equality, empowering those oppressed, Blessing & Curse factors need to taught & spread.
Men are men (Deceptive feminism & equality are destroying it),
Women are women (Exploitative tactics masquerading as freedom are ruining them), Third gender shall be third gender(Abuse, a detriment to society).
This is a world of compensation."

"It’s still a hypocritical… you would say that this modem feminism & wave of women acting like whores online is their choice & their freedom THAT we can choose not to watch it and it wouldn’t effect our culture & influence our society & women & brainwas them into being one of the TikTok half naked dancing slut … But But … how watching this Animal movie is a cancer & can effect whole humanity & Men … 😂😂 
The hypocrisy in this world…"
Bhai ne berojgar ko imagine karne ko bola aur maine khud ko imagine kar liya 😥💪🏼
Male and female have different positive things to each other but they are not same
"Rathe bruh … You need to expose the real truth of modern feminism & woke culture… 
It’s all about manipulation & control & power & hypocrisy … Today men suffer so much because of the modern feminism… it’s truth … I have so many examples… thousands of men are suffering in jail because of women women just “Cried” & lied even if they tell the truth they never get punished… 
They want equality but no responsibility… 
They want to manipulate women into thinking being naked is only way for freedom & power … Our culture is getting raped by the modem feminists & woke people.. I see 16 years old girls in social media dancing & showing ass & boobs … 
Telling our girls to wear decent clothes is not old school Or control or oppressive… it’s pure care & respect … women’s body is very different then men & more sexual…  it’s very true  … now some will hate because I said that but … also jump to kill a man if he touch a women without permission but if a women touches a man without permission it’s not even considered a issue… So it’s all hypocrisy you want women to think they they can & should walk naked if they want but we are forced to see that & accept that in our culture but if we want then to see naked then we are wrong … 
Think about it …
It’s very deep 
This modern feminism have ruined the real women & men … They will  destroy this world … There was a reason people back then didn’t let women do certain thing no. Women were not capable neither wanted to do dangerous & tough work … men & women both suffered & men sacrificed their whole life’s protecting women & children & building this world… well for thousands of years feminists were asleep & when the world was developed suddenly the feminists wanted equality from men & women … 
Powerful people always exploit weak … doesn’t matter it’s women or men …"
"i do believe in equality but that dosent mean im a feminist. if u apply that logic any person who believes in self improvement is a redpiller.

i do agree with what u talked about feminism but modern feminism has deviated from its original goal."
I understand some good women have Berne discriminated but today feminism is all about politics & control… it’s all about being men … literally getting all the benefits & manipulation of women & telling them being naked is freedom & men are useless while living in the world build & maintained by men … they teach women to hate men more & more … & biggest hypocrites is modern feminism
"Feminists & Woke & Pride Culture is destroying the whole Humanity… it’s deep … what I said think … it’s it about equality or freedom … All they want is Supremist Movement … 
You can not say a world or you’ll get fired or even arrested or cancelled… 
Thousands of men’s life gets destroyed everyday but the women behind them never get punished … 
The Matriarchy can also be considered that so called “Social conditioning” 
All the things about good women are wrong but also true at the same time … I believe in equal rights but they don’t want equal responsibility or equal lefts … 
Women are becoming whores online day by day I see teenagers dancing and showing their ass & boobs like every other girl on social media … yet you say it’s their freedom & right but then it’s also Against people culture so if they  are allowed to do that we should at least be allowed to practice our culture… 
This feminism & “freedom” is also not Indian then it cultural or religious… it’s literally doing the same thing forcing their objective on us … & saying we are wrong if we don’t want our daughters & sisters half naked & brainwashed init being only fans models & walking on streets literally in a bra & panty … 
It’s all hypocrisy & double standards… No accountability for women & deluded mindset is all what feminism offers you … 
There a lot but y’all not really to even discuss it …"

See the thing is that women is an enemy of women…..men are just busy in their 9 to 5 job but women fight with each other for example saas babu and then the villan will be the men
"The kind of influence of patriarchy is still a big topic coz every one of us is struggling against this. It's not against womens but also against mens as well.. but at the same time womens who are fighting against patriarchy are also not wanting feminism in true sense.. I mean how many womens who are self dependent are actually marrying a guy who have the paying job less that her??? Very less right.. but you will not see any women will raise voice against it.. means indirectly they wanted to use patriarchy as a means to get benefitted for their feminism character... Also when you see around nowadays womens are embracing those relationships which has toxicity factors  which is also accessory to patriarchal behaviour and the big thing is they actually wanted such relationships..
The main problem of having feminism for womens are they treat it like pseudo feminism.. it develops in them ""I don't need a man"" kind of attitude or need a man who will have high paying jobs... I mean how they are calling themselves as self dependent womens if they wholly or partly rely on finances of your partner???

In simple sense, patriarchy will never gets over bcz both of genders are using it for their benefits to support their choices."

Respect for dhruv rathee❤
"We should talk about Individual rights ONLY, rather than simplifying it to a gender, every gender has their problems"
"To be fair to history, the feminist movement seems to have misappropriated or have been forced to use the word ""FEMIN-ism"" as a name for the obvious natural right to equality of all genders and sexes. If it was called egalitarianism or simply ""equalism"" instead of femin-ism, it would not get so badly misunderstood, misused and decried by the patriarchy.
When feminism means equalism, why not use the correct word, i.e. equalism?
This pre-emptive move to cover everything under the name ""feminism"" probably has (I am guessing here) an interesting set of historical anecdotes or events, in order to protect or optimise the feldgling women's rights and women's liberation movements. But the lasting damage done by this misnomenclature is that feminism finds it hard to break into patriarchal mindsets merely due to the name. The name has become a burden, not an advantage.
As a software developer, I can say with a lot of experience, name your variables, functions and classes correctly, lest some other programmer make a mess of the system by using your code wrongly due to the wrong name.
Note that I am not commenting about anything else than the unfortunate or opportunistic mistake in nomenclature.
Everything else is fine. Baki sab theek hai, sahi hai.
Just to be clear, we must acknowledge the fact that female cats, dogs and rats don't have to listen to the orders of male cats, dogs and rats. Nature has a lot of equality of rights and also a lot of inherent freedoms, which human society denies to both men and women. Some for good reasons, but many for the wrong reasons (vested interests of a sub group)."

"Things are changing now, by women empowerment, feminism, equal rights and freedom. Many womens use these things as a weapon to suppress mens. I think after some decades there will be matriarchal society to some extent. Majority of peoples have sympathy with a female be it society, office or a courtroom. Day by day things are shifting to other end, extreme of everything is toxic to society. There should be balance in everything for males and females."

"It is not about patriarchal mindset vs feminist mindset, it is more about to let the person do whatever  he wants to (Freedom to live life in the way they want). If a women wants to work, achieve something great let her do that and treat her equal with the males doing the same work. On the other hand if a women wants to sit at home and don't want to work let her, it's not because of patriarchal thinking or lack of freedom.
Same should be allowed to males also. Just imagine if a man wants to sit at home and her wife works for their livelihood, seems impossible."

Fact is that we knew the wrong defination of feminism....
"In my opinion it is not the social condition because of which a female is having patriarchal mindset.
The truth is that everyone want to relax in life, don't want to work hard. And females have that choice, to just get married to a men who earns well and she can just sit at home and enjoy.
Only few womens want to achieve something in life, work hard. And others choose to relax, eventually develop patriarchal thinking."

Very aptly identified issue
"Feminism is about equality where it benefits women and special treatment where they like... free stuff, chivalry and what not is supported and equal pay even when they do not bring in equal money, that's what feminism is in 21st century. No need to justify it. It is male bashing and it is about creating an evil picture of everything male. 
Misandry is socially acceptable and male issues are invalidated and ignored, meanwhile news and media highlights women issues like nothing. Unfortunately saying good things about women even if by talking shit about men.... makes you look good in society.

Men do not have an important right, right to be a victim... and yes modern radical feminism being spread in every part of society is to be blamed if not completely, significantly"

"Feminism is no longer a equal opportunity to women movement. The definition you presented is very old. Feminism has been corrupted over the years and now feminism has converted to Women Supremacy movement. There is literally no such rights in today's society that men have, that women do not have. Feminism is no longer needed in today's world. If we still need a movement then it should be a gender equality movement rather that a movement just for women."

I just want to ask you if feminism is all ahoit equal rights then why there are no laws for protection of men? Why there is no punishment for women who misuse the laws made for protection? Sumpreme court declared 498a as legal terrorism but still no changes in the law. A man is punished if he has physical relationship with a female on false promise of marriage but a woman is not punished if she had also promised for marriage?

Gender alag hain = this is wrong statement
Actually it is true that we are different but biologically, means sex is different.

And gender is socially constructed term means gender is constructed by society as per cultural norm.

So instead of using the term  gender we should use the term Sex."
"Theoretically I have to agree with you but ultimately you have to live with the society where most of the brain are patriarchal ,  And it's not practically  possible for a guy or a girl to act upon your thoughts because the repercussions are there . In today's life  everything is  becoming so much  costly ( marriages, pregnancy, kids education, parents medicine)and people have to busy with their multiple sources of  earnings thus they are already exhausted with the personal problem and had no time to compete with these social stigma."

In rape case govt have given more rights to women by which some men are charged fake rape cases.
"Dhruv is talking about foreign thinkers like olympe de gouges how she is called first to call for equal rights for women in 1800's. He failed to mention First Sikh Guru.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji in 15th century said ''सो क्यों मंदा आखिए, जित जन्मे राजान..' meaningmen and women are equal and therefore women cannot be considered socially or spiritually inferior.Of woman are we born, of woman conceived. To woman engaged and married. Woman are befriended, by woman is the civilization continued. When woman dies, woman is sought for. It is by woman that the entire social order is maintained. Then why call her bad? From her Kings are born – SGGS , p.473.. 
Guru Nanak Ji said पवन गुरु पानी पिता माता धरत महत :meaning Air is Guru, Water is father, land is mother, respect them conserve them,without them nothing survives. He said this in 15th century when there was no pollution. He is the first person to promote equality to every human being rejecting Caste system, promoted HUMAN RIGHTS (when at that time there was no such word as human rights, other living beings' rights, believed in feeding the needy and rejected superstions. He started LANGER pratha which mandated that irrespective of the person's caste or rich poor or male female etc, everyone get free food at equal place without any kind of discrimination. whether he is king or beggar or from any of the so called caste.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji said ""Dharti pare hor pare hor"" meaning there are many countless earths, another earth on the far side of the other. He said this when there were no development in sciene, and the world believed there is only this earth where life exists and it is the centre of the whole universe.

Please make a video on Guru Nanak Dev Ji. His life, his thinking, his words. would love to view it."

If providing for and protecting your woman is patriarchal then let it be becoz humans evolved due to patriarchy. So this smash the patriarchy thing is as ridiculous as it is delusional."

Islam not only  gives rights to women but also honour. e.g. Islam says paradise is under the feet of your Mother. Most people who are unaware of Islam think that Islam suppress women but in reality Islam gives women a perfect way of honourable life. You know my Father kiss me on my head and always become happy to hear my voice..... Why? Because Islam teach us to love our daughter. But Islam also teach us to cover yourself because pearls are always covered❤❤

Lucknow wali news ko jab ladka innocent prove hua fr kisi b female reporter ne news cover nhi kia .. news hi halki pad gai...usse pehle....cheekh cheeck kr chilla rahi thi......aur anti romeo k naam pr bhi khoob harrasment hua hum ladko ka ... but dhruv bhai vo bhul gae... because he is now married man....i can understand..😢😢😢

B J P wants to establish Patriarchy and Casteism and by doing this he thinks that he is superior than others and will continue ruling forever... LoL...😂😂🤣🤣🤣 Those who go against Human Nature and Law of Nature( Discrimination and Uncha Neecha) they and those ideas will always fall...Both patriarchy and casteism( ideas of B J P) are against Law of Nature and Humans Prakriti....Lol B J P... 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Research work is required, in order to decrease the society problems. Work should be carried out by asking questions from both male and female then see the results where the path actually going either towards Good side or bad. You will know what is side effects of this path and that path then conclude the result simply... I will say men and women are not equal because they have different strength and weaknesses... A women can make many boyfriends whereas men can not. A women have difficulty to find someone real who provide real security whereas any type of men can provide real security to women... A women is beautiful when she have family, children. Otherwise single woman looks beautiful when she is under 30s. After then? A single women without family looks so bad... This is reality. In order to solve problem. Do research and generate your own laws or follow Islamic laws. Islam describe how to solve society problems without requiring research work. Because it is complete research where no one can find research gap."
"Man u r a big misandrist. Once again u have presented one side of the story as if women are the only gender who are suffering. When on earth will u present a balanced story. Women should have equal rights and in its theoretical definition feminism looks good too. But u need to look at the practical application of feminism. The way it has made life a living hell for a common male. No you will not talk about it. Just keep speaking as if we r living in a la la land where no woman is going to abuse the unequal powers given to women in the name of equality. This wrong application of ""feminism"" has completely rotten the west. The effects of which can be seen in their society now."
Galat topic ko choose kar liye Dhruv bhai ye aisi topic hai jiske dono sides galat nikal jayenge so I’m completely confused ki aap kis ko or sahi bologe
Toxic Feminism is killing good working Men and Society.

"Actually the problem is in the word itself, not the meaning and the movement. The word itself seems like one-sided when someone first hears about it. That's why some people can take advantage of it. I think the great movement should be renamed so the confusion will end. I believe men and women are not the enemy of each other. We both are companions to each other in every sense. The real enemy are the people who want to make us separate for their own personal agenda."
He is the person who can prove wrong as right or 2+2 =5. Man and woman can be equal in terms of right but both are different by body and thoughts. First thing is that a person should be filled with humanness and compassion irrespective of man or woman. A person should not torture to other human being irrespective of gender.
As a  Muslim I'll say Islam already give all necessary rights to women.
"I will tell you a situation which happened to me , I was drinking with my friends and some aged men so one of that aged man got angry and started to argue with me he started challenging me to drink more than him than I refused than he slapped me then I also got mad then he started saying it was only one slap are you a girl , you are not a man. It means that a guy can take more hits than a girl for nothing in a party or public 🤯😵‍💫"

"13:18 what you are saying is idealistic, in reality, after coming home the wife will only say and taunt him that you couldn't even stand up for yourself, how will you stand up for me"
"13:18 Dhruv what you are saying is very idealistic, in real life that will not happen at all, if some hater comes at your home and starts breaking things and shouting at you, you would not just be quiet and politely ask him to leave."
"Dhruv is a completely brain washed person... He will never talk about discrimination in legal system against men, and fake cases against men..."

"@dhruvRathee : Please don't use the casteist word "" Chhapris "".  @22.52 

Chhapris is a sub caste, just like Chamar, kanjar, bhangi, Mochi, Nayi ,chapri  etc.

"" Chhapris are a caste-oppressed community of people who made or mended chhappars, temporary roofs. This was the only job they were allowed to do because of their caste, which was assigned to them by the accident of birth. """
I support you. 🎉❤
If feminism is equality why do they get angry by the idea of replacing this word with “equalism”?
But feminist women wants their first baby as boy.👍🏻
"Bilkul sahi👍👍👍❤

what about burkha ?
Islam gives you that things
Bhai apko 2019 se follow ker raha hoon per apki iss video mai buhut loop holes hai yeh video apki most un researched video hai ya may be app positive dikhna chahte thai I don't know but  i am very upset to you
Respect
Can you please make a video on GenZ generation
Why don’t you post against sharia law where women are beheaded for not wearing burqa? And why do majority of “feminists” support burqa so much ?
"Feminism is female communism. Earlier it was good, now it has long gone from betterment of women. It has become a tool for women to cope with their flaws. For example, their was a harmless meme that Emma Watson is looking so pretty without makeup also. A feminist woman got angry and said this is patriarchal, we all are beautiful. And modern fake feminism is actually not benifitting women. They stir peer pressure of modernity in women which in turn benefits cigarette companies, perverted men etc…"
Bro what are the feminist fighting for tho aren't they perceived the same in this society pls explain sir
"Toxic alpha misogynists are just male counterparts of toxic feminists. Both feel their gender is superior, both want special respect for their gender (eg, feminists don’t wanna get accountable for their mistakes and some think of themselves as Goddesses and alphas want women to serve them). Both categories are full of ego , both categories are toxic. True equalists are different from both."

"Feminism in itself is an illogical and baseless ideology , demanding identicality when These two sexes are extremely different in majority of the ways is illogical. Dhruv at this point is just being a mouthpiece of liberalism."
very interesting video ❤ love from Pakistan
Wo chapri gang yese v loser hote h and according to their pov woman weak hoti h jinke samne wo khud ko strong feel kr skte aab wahi ladkiya khud well educated and financially independent ho jti then inka ego trigger hone lgta that's why  ye social media pr teenage boys/girls ko manipulate krte ki buri characterless ladkiya he hoti jo job ya self independent hoti Orr achii ladkiya patriarchy he follow krti unke validation me fit hone k liye kuch ladkiya  he ladkiyo k khilaf ho jti
U r just a propaganda person  forced family and culture are the biggest and the last weapons in the hands of corporate exploiters liberalism has to seep into the lower strata too
Toxic feminism is destroying men 😢
Nice video 👍
Great 👍
"Both of my sisters openly make fun of short men and tell me they're too ugly and keep praising my 6'2 height. They even make fun of tall women. What the hell? 💀💀

females these days think onlyf@ns and twerking on reels means empowerment 💀💀
Dont use half quote of Quran without reading  Quran
"Unpopular opinion:humans thrive on chaos,inequality and even violence there will be no equality in world because human nature seems to be against it,various attempts at establishing true equality have ended in tragedy,internal sabotage,war or other reasons human nature is the reason why capitalism still exists and divide between rich and poor exists a true feminist society can never prosper in capitalism because capitalism seeks profit over human well-being,money over political ideology everything and everyone is on sell in capitalism feminism,like communism and liberalism is incompatible with human nature even the most good and brave humans can be greedy and selfish call me a cynic or self-defeatist,but it's the truth humans want equal society,but won't accept to endure losses or lose access to their money or comfort"

Thank you Dhruv Rathee⭐
"Thanks bro. You have explained this topic so gracefully, hope people understand the real meaning of feminism."
Thank you clearing this out to your audience.....this was much needed... people doesn't know the basic difference...i hope after watching this some people changes their mentality.....thank you for making this video ❤
What are the rights that man have and woman don’t? Can anyone enlighten me
"सरकारी नौकरी में बराबर वेतन पाती है महिलाएं काम मर्दो के बराबर नही करती हैं।
1 पुलिस जब एनकाउंटर करने जाती है उसमें महिला नही होती
2 कैदियों को पेशी पे महिला नही ले जाती
3 मुजरिमो को गिरफ्तार नही करने जाती
4 नाईट ड्यूटी नही करती 
5 सियाचिन में पहरा नही देती
6 युद्ध मे हिस्सा नही लेती"
"I feel relieved to see this video . My english teacher once told me that feminism isn't about only women rather its about both men and women getting equal rights :) i hope people understand this term and being a girl i am totally against those women who bend this term according to their own interests and changing its true meaning . 
Both women and men deserve equal rights , thats what feminism stands for ! :)"
Toxic feminist ab ladko ko misguide kar rahi hai aur ladke bewakoof ki tarah toxic Femisto ki sun rahe hai.
Men commission hona bohot jaruri hai
Feminism se ladko ko nukasan ho raha hai ladko fasaya ja raha hai exploitation ho raha hai ab vakt aagaya hai ki ladko ko bhi apne liye hak mangne chahiye aur khud ke protection ke liye law banana chahiye? Kyu ki bohot sari toxic female ab aajad ghum rahi hai. aur unke pass ladko ko barbad karne ka pura adhikar sarkar ne diya hai.
Even if a girl is worried a guy demands beautiful girl who will take care of him and family. So with the added pressure women after marriage tends to give up on her career. For financial security if she expects man to earn more what wrong?

"You only showed a clip from a VHP, what’s said about a wife’s duty in Hindu scriptures but nothing about what’s said about them in other religions & how they’re treated by other groups. They’re actually the most regressive parts of present-day Indian society. Shame. 
Or do you not regard them as not part of the Indian society? 😉"
I love you ❤

Sir can you make more video about this topic.
Nice dhruv sir excellent 👌👍😊
Good Information
❤❤❤
Pakistan k current politics our elections par b video banawo na
Bro is there any law that men has rights on but woman does'nt ?  If there is'nt then what are the feminist fighting for ? I am just asking some questions i don't mean any harm to any gender.(Pardon my english).
Aur aapse main WhatsApp dwara baat karna chahta hun
Dhruv Bhai aap bahut acchi tarike se samjhate ho Aapka Channel aapka episode main Jarur dekhta hun aapka Jaisa Koi Nahin
Bina puri jankari ke kuch bhi kahna bekar hai
"Ek cheez aur ki agar ladke kuch karte hain aur jo shayad kuch cases mein utna bhi galat nahi hota aur ladki agar uske naam pe ek case thok dengi to uska career barbad ho jaega aur wohi isko ulta karke dekho agar ladki kuchi bhi karti hai to usko galat sabit karne ke liye kuch nahi hai aur yahan pe unko power diya ja raha hai aur mein yahan kuch ladikiyon ki baat kar raha hun aur ye facts hain,han ye bhi sach hai ki ladkiyon ke saath bhi bahut galat hota hai aur hum wo sab kuch dekhte reh jate hain ye doblapan nahi hai me samaj me sudhar ki baat kar raha hun 🙏 so its my humble request to all that help us to creat a new society,where all have their equal rights to live."
"You didn't show the full clip of Neena Gupta se spoke about real feminism, you just cut the clip and showed the Strong parts."
लज्जा भी एक अच्छी फिल्म है
Han aur ye bhi sahi hai ki kuch ladkiyan iss feminism wale topic ko galat hisab se le rahin hai.Ham sab kahi nahi galat hain ladkiyon ki soch ko lekar par ye bhi sahi hai ki isi feminism ke teht kuch log iss sabd ka galat istemal kar rahe hain aur bahut sari cases me aap dekh sakte hain ki hamara constitution mahilaon ko jyada support kar raha hai aur iska galat istemal bhi ho raha hai ae baat agar male female equality ki chal rahi hai to sabko saman khyamta milni chahiye aur koi baat bhi nahi karta iske bare me
"Sab ke pass ye khyamta hai ki wo apne aap ko strong dikhaen aur yahan baat insan ki ho rahi hai aur baat hai kya galat aur kya actual me sahi hai ,thappad marna galat hai chahe wo mard ho ya aurat we all should be feminist.Thik hai hamare pass hormones hai like testosterone aur ye ladkiyon ke pass bhi hai ye sach hai nature ne distinguish karne ke liye hume aisa banaya hai aur hum logon ne ise pura alag banadiya yes men can build more  muscles than female but ye toh nahi ki ladkiyon ko daba ke rakha jae"
This is the longest I saw any Dhruv Rathi video..... what an epic waste of my 7 and a half mins
"I commented under Neena Gupta's vid when she gave this comment publicily as I saw manyy boys calling her real women and I defined the real meaning of feminism and then a boy replied under my commment and started bashing me for supporting feminism and called me fake and reason of creating a division between men and women , i literally gave him explaination for two days that I am not suppoting Patriarchal people  but supporting equality for both men and women but the irony was he was well educated."
Topic of this video is great.. Thanks for posting.
i am so greatful  that you made this video. everyone is born a feminist. no baby is born thinking the other sex is superior or inferior to them. it's the patriarchal society that teaches us otherwise. people have such a wrong def of feminism in their mind. they think women falsely accusing men of crime or taking advantage of them is feminism. but who told them that's feminism. like who?!
My mind and soul gets peace after listing to you about listing the ideology which l also have ....all the chapri in Instagram made me feel like ..hell...they are so senseless that ..l get headache ...thanks to you to bring the real issues ...❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
"To all the men who have been brainwashed and didn't understand feminism meaning at first and have been hating women for evrything.... please you have been wrong. This video is the correct way of showcasing every gender protest that's been happening historically. ......and Dear men ,if you ever feel like showing your emotions feel free to do so... It may take time to get right partners and friends to listen to you but please don't hold back your thoughts and emotions. And always maintain a diary if you feel too much ...share your emotions on diary,write it down...as i girl i guarantee Diary is the best choice to talk to. ... I also feel little uncomfortable crying publicly or even with my girl friend in general.....and diary helps the best. And secrets are always saved. .... you're not alone we all have struggle as humans in different ways that's it.....and I hope your views on feminism have changed to positive because we atleast wanna be treated as human first.. before treating us as women physically or mentally."
Nice work
Society will never change whatever we say.
"I am a proud wife of a feminist husband…trying to raise my son as one too…we are equalists in true sense…When we got married my income was double than his but we both were not perturbed though many relatives were…on the other hand one of my husbands friend married his gf after 10 years of dating after getting a salary more than his girlfriend’s…what kind of weird logic is that…Being a bengali I have come across most Bengali men as feminists and equalists and trust me I have interacted with Indian men in office across sections, states, caste, religion etc…we have a long way to go still…"
I m sorry. Salman Rushdie not a legendary person. He is 🐷 pig
Here is a huge diffrence between feminism & women empowerment.Thankyou Dhruv sir for making a video on this topic :)❤
Bahut khoob
Modi = ADANI+ Corruption + Unemployment + Inflation + arajakata
One of the best video on youtube ❤
"You speaks very nicely... But please speak about other religions too... Why you can't quote quran even for once... Why you  can't utter a single word about muslim scholars who openly defame females... But you can quote garudpuran and a spokesperson of VHP. 

Think about it dhruv..."
"Feminism is right and we support that but towadays many women's are using it in a wrong way

Due to which women's who really need laws for their protection also get untrusted"
"This video by Dhruv Rathee challenges the idea that feminism is about men vs. women, instead arguing it's about smashing harmful gender roles that limit everyone. It explores how both men and women suffer under patriarchal expectations, and showcases real feminist heroes who fought for equality for all. Join the call to create a world where everyone can be their true selves, free from outdated norms and expectations."
"Allah (god,ishwar, bhagwan) jisne sochkar bolne wala dimag Diya insan ko.
Wo apni kitab me kehta hai.

I hate femminist.
Good.
Tu cutiya ho maan lo ladko k uper blame lage or wo mulzim ho jata h is  baat koi sense h😂😂😂
This video is totally waste of time🤮
🎉
Dhruv Rathee you are stupid. Women are equal as women and men are equal to men only. Not men as equal as women.
I feel sleep while watching your video
I  agree with you
Thankyou
23:37 completely agree with this point 💯 I observed this too
"Let me kill his claims by facts 

1.Right to vote was given to men because every single men in a country is obligated to fight in a war if a country needs them most of the women protest against right to vote for women  

2 women already have more rights then men . Women can now accuse you of rape without any proof or any physical contact 

3. Scandinavian countries like finland , norway and sweden where feminism rules instead of 
Equalising  it leads to more division- jordron peterson 

3 indian marriages divorce rate - 2-3 %
Western society-almost 70 % 

Marriage is a duty / sacrifice and your moral obligation 

As feminists grew happiness with index for women went down every year 
 
4 its not social conditioning it’s biological it’s how we evolved its in out DNA   Women like tall men because back in evolution women need a men to protect and provide other wise other men will kill her child and rape her that’s why women will always live tall  strong men 

Men we  hate unfaithful women because back in evolution men can’t ever know is the child his or someone else so men have evolved this way"
"Dude, Be a man. Protect your women, but you are....!"

"Zyaada mard dhruv rathee jaise chakke hai aur ikkate nahi hai, isiliye women equality aur feminism jaise bhimaari humari samaj mein phele hue hai"
And should also tell that out of 2.5 % more that 2 percent ks because of feminist FALSE allegations of rape and domestic violence
But now modern feminism is not about equal rights its about only women privilege
"Problem starts when people(irrespective of gender) demand pseudo-feminism instead of feminism or people start identifying feminism as pseudo feminism or as you said toxic feminism. Feminism has lost it's meaning over the years and that's where the problem lies. This has been mentioned by you in the last part of the video thank you for making this.

Equality has been guaranteed by the constitution and our law but our society, sadly, is not yet mature enough to accept it whole heartedly.
This will not change since it will require more intervention by the government and if they do that they will lose votes."

They bring about violations, nudity, and inappropriate clothing, harming our Sanskriti while using the term 'feminist.' We respect feminism but won't support those who bring chaos to society. Similar to Salman Rushdie, I don't understand why . Rathee sir  look him in this discussion."
Bhai Neena Gupta ne kya galat bola usne yahi to bola na ki physically dono me defference hai aur ek aur baat.. Viv Richards ka kuchh nhi hua pr neena ji ko bahut kuchh sehna pda tha.. ye hai antar baki rights dono ke equal hone chahiye ye to main bhi manta hu
Distroy my life 😢
Good video man 👍
"Amazing ❤❤❤
Thank you for giving us such a information 
Love it ❤"
An intelligent take
He really thinks we are dumb and blind and do not see the Twitter and incidents that happen now a days
I think feminism is becoming men hating. The false rap cases are also increasing...
"Let me be clear with my statement, I don't know a great number of self-proclaimed so called alpha male and masculinists disguised as chauvinists will get offended. But the fact is if you look at present day Indian Society, girls are more focused than overall boys in making their career and totally minding their own business, while most of the boys are busy in social media and getting distracted easily by toxic influences and thus being led by insecurity, they judge women and try to find negative potential from them and generalize the whole community. 
So, my message for those frustrated incels : Please, get a life!! And stop bashing and blaming FEMINISM as an act of retaliation for the welfare of yourselves and the whole. Thank you🙏🏼"
Just spitting the dark truth of society that still alive in society !!
How hypocrite it sounds when you quoted Vishnu puran that it promotes patriarchy but you don't have the courage to quote Quran verses which clearly say how women should dress and many such things.But that doesn't seem plundering feminism in your vision...
"Just say ...tu phisaddi hai ..and move on,"

"Patriarchy log womens ko equal rights dene me darte h , kahi equal rights milne ke baad women unka harassment na karne lag jaaye. Baat h apne hisaab se kaam karwane ki. Men sochta h mere hisab se ho aur aurat sochti h mere hisab se ho. Agar equal rights de diye gaye to daar h women ke hisaab se chalna padega . Example h country me fake dowry cases , fake domestic violence cases. Law hi equal nahi h india me to. Mens are facing harassment."
"How is a black person and white person different? This is wrong at so many levels. Zero research, plain opinion based narrative building."
Is video ko dekh ke lagta h ki ye sab baate kabhi kahi sikhai hi nahi gayi. Na school me aur na ghar me. Shikhayi bhi kaise jaayegi jab log jaante hi nahi. This is real education.

Bro forget about any of your hater I salute you from the bottom of my heart today I got so emotional watching your video that I was literally about to cry but didn't because boys don't cry . Just kidding this is the biggest bullshit I have ever heard I cry I cry a lot that doesn't mean I am not a boy if crying a little can save my or anyone else's life crying is good Once again I love your videos very much and I appreciate it the most touching part was about having mother and sister I feel one should consider about them before saying something like that and sorry I want to talk a lot but it will be too long of a comment so bye ❤❤❤❤❤
Proud to be  a feminist

"first video of Druv Rathi in 6 years i watched right now just based on pure hypocrisy. effect of marriage!! thoughts of Druv Rathi might have changed!! you should check out the reality.  the men are being tortured by discriminative law made the the country with the push of feminism by feminist. social imbalance being increasing day by days. values are almost dead...  
.
you should rethink and make video again... good luck and get well soon."
"Women and man can never be equal it's just not how nature made us if we go back to cave times, men used to hunt and feed the family which made them masculine where women had role to follow the motherhood and raise the child and that made them feminine. If women start to earn just as a man she have to force alot of masculine energy and she won't be recessive anymore in relationship and it's probably the worst thing. I think we both gender should follow their own roles and not go against the nature."

"Dhruv, I've been following you for the past 3-4 yrs, BUT, here, I disagree with you on some points related to patriarchy. 
You say men too should express their emotions (especially, crying) openly. But, no. If there's no shame for a man to cry openly, then do you think that will lead to strong men that the society needs? If a man who has got a whole family looking upon him cries, then how would the family stay emotionally strong? Just imagine, if a kid is seeing his father crying every other day, what strength will he impart in himself? In fact, I'd say women too should not become so emotionally expressive. ... 

Do you think a man (no doubt, physically tougher than a woman) is naturally destined to stay at home and lay on her wife's money? Does this fit the definition of a 'man'? 

I'm not completely in favour of patriarchy. There are bad things in it too. But, what i'm seeing is that in search of a balance, all these 'feminists' are in turn making men weak and too lenient which should not be the case. There should always be a bit of toughness in being a man and that's what leads to strong men and strong societies. All through the history."
men's aggressive because testosterone / why male animals aggression ?👎👎

Sir your video example of  familism to equal value of boy and girl😁
"My personal take would be, true equality does not exist, or atleast in todays mindset. Upon generalising, Fenimist wants to 'surpass' men. Goes both ways.

Ps, this may also come in bad light but some (most) women do like to be quite submissive as well"
You are less informed in this matter

THANK YOU DHRUV RATHEE 🙏🏻
"The video was commendable in its balanced portrayal of various issues and the clear distinction it drew between feminism and pseudo-feminism. Highlighting B.R. Ambedkar's contributions would have further enriched the discussion on women's empowerment in India, as his efforts significantly contributed to improving the lives of women in the country."

"I would like to have equality in court too, where a guy can lose his whole career over a rape accusation, and the girl who put it goes off like nothing happened or the 50% divorce pay, always from a guy, alimony it's always the guy who has to give, abd huge amounts at that, child support is needed but why these super high prices, why can't the guy have the kid if the female can't pay it or more like wants wayyy more  money than needed for child support, how fathers can't see their kids cause the mother doesn't let them so he has to put years in court and get nothing while the mother spread false stuff like your dad doesn't pay us enough. Courts always have females on top, free lawyers, more ways to get money from guys, marriage to me is a scam now, you entire house you alone bought can be gone in just a minute."

You have just explained what Feminism is but the real problem is with the current scenario that majority gen-z females are also cursing their father and brother how that problem should be addressed.
In my childhood I do the same thing what he say koi gali de to sehen krlo koi chidaye to seh lo and this was the biggest nightmare for me i am facing alot of issue in my current life that time i was in depression but still now i do the same but give the right answer to that one who bullying me not at all time but i still thinking if i stop that people right time my childhood never be ruined by them 😭 still i am worried that i was suffered from a worst childhood experience so traumatic 😭😭🤌
13:02 best thought 😊

"This happens in our well educated family and society. Somertimes we as a women has to step back because of male ego . one such incident happened on new year night . in the parking lot one car was continously honking , i rold them not to do it and have some patience , it hurt the male ego of the driver and  and the boy and women sitting inside. Without understanding the situation they started yelling , cursing and pushing us. Funny fact was women with them also started shouting that i am a women and i should know my limits. Well analysing the severity of the situation i said sorry to them. But they kept on shouting. This is what   our socity is😢. Here the patriarchy was that how can I say being a women."
Dhruv sir please make a video on mental health ❤
Abb pura Control women ko de do bey
Bhai feminism ka Matlab hi ni pata 90 percent Janta ko 😂
"It all boils down to mentality. Granting women every right they deserve is crucial. It should be entirely up to women to decide what they want for themselves. I have many female friends who express a desire for a simpler life. They're not interested in pursuing careers or higher education; instead, they aspire to find happiness in marriage and family life. And that's completely valid. On the other hand, I also have friends who are passionate about achieving equality with men. They want to explore life, have fun, and pursue their dreams without limitations. Both choices are admirable and should be respected equally. It's about empowering women to make decisions that align with their desires and aspirations, whatever they may be."
Feminism is fail mission which is impossible on this earth
Awesome video. You have brought the hypocrisy level of both sides. Bravo!!!
Beautiful video boss...
Now people like dhruv will tell us about women rights 😂

"i see man and women have same rights. btw me and my group of school,colloge and office male friend see a beautiful girl as a food. when we talk to them we behave good but inside of our mind want to eat them even they have husband or children. so i am not secured my wife work in the office and communicate deal with the people like us. 

if i want my beautiful wife work in office me and my friend type of male will eat her. i don't belive in love i belive in situation and reality. 

one of the female youtuber nikita thakur says, in india 60% of that women sleep with others.lot's of beautiful girl who had had children,husband even had love merrage, eaten by my friend. if i love my wife and don't want to lost her, i must protect her. i am bad, but i am not going to let her go and eaten by fox. 

for this reason, now a days most of the family is broken."

"The term ""aadmi"" has its etymological roots in Persian. It is derived from the Persian word ""adam"" (آدم), which means ""man"" or ""human."" Over time, this term has been adopted and integrated into various languages, including Urdu and Hindi.

In Urdu and Hindi, ""aadmi"" is commonly used to refer to a human being, a person, or a man in the generic sense. It's a gender-neutral term, encompassing both men and women."
True 💯
I'm sorry Dhruv but I disagree. If you want to stand for equality for all women and men of India. Please talk about the laws in India and then talk about how they are applied to citizens of either sex.

Women facilitates patriarchy. The women who couldn’t live the dream supports such system
Wow....what a pure form of knowledge with examples just amazing no one can explain better than You....👀✨
What I don't understand is what rights women of this era are talking about. What kind of rights women don't have that men have. If you guys expect that if a guy is getting X amount of salary then girl should also be earning same X amount which is the most illogical demand I've ever heard. Those jobs are NOT BASED ON GENDERS. Woman will get as much salary as man if she does the job as good as man. Companies even prefer women if there are two shortlisted candidates (male and female) with same skillset.
still some men are saying what patriarchy says but blaming it to feminism
That people should see this video which this was made for
society will be lot better when people understand the difference between feminism and toxic feminism
Totally agree........🎉

"You guys are very much influenced by this guy, and you believe that this guy is 100 percent right about the thing.

"Patriarchy🗿, it is not a rule book created by your forefathers, it is an accepted way of living by masculine men and feminine women, but in today's world, men are becoming feminine and women are trying to be masculine that's why they hate patriarchy. Be a man and increase your testosterone so that you don't have a perspective like druv rathee 😂"

A Clever person never be against Feminism He/She is against the wrong mindset.
there shouldnt be different sports competetions for women and men they should be played against each other .
"Thuck this is non sensible because we all know how's our mindset about girls .
Girls will be have different schools and all different things.
Because of them we are distract
They don't dress well etc. that' it sorry if my English is bad but there will be separate rules for girls . In the world there is no equally important just like in India Mumbai local train also has a private girl section but in men there are not any section as girls . There is no permission to the men to get in girl section But girls can easily go everywhere. That's also not fair . Hence I am with feminism but not equality."
"I m following druv sir from 3 years and he really changed my thinking about society, economic, international politics etc"
I don't think we need equality....women are better in some things men are better are others....treat them differently.same like similar but different contribution efforts of climate change

"Some matriarchies societies exist  in some places in the world today and the men are healthy and super happy. But they need better moral female characters in film. It seems these feminists film is lesser of two evils. Because male films are more vile in violence in rape scenes, crime glory, gun fights, and zombie films over flow. Men can beat the mess out these feminists in these films of so called notorious women. It's really movies about whores as villians not real super hero or the good feminist types. I suppose Bollywood is trying to say if a woman wants power she has to be a whore. That is messed up. Men really do disrespect women because we feel they are second class to men and need to stay there. But what if they don't stay submitted is not a guarantee. It looks like change is happening honestly."

"""Feminism is the idea that we can make both sexes equal by focusing solely on the issues of one of them."" - The Amazing Atheist AKA TJ Kirk"
"Respect all human beings regardless of gender. That's it ! Every human being needs care because we are transient beings. Disease and calamity creates tragic one day. So, we should focus on mutual respect without looking at gender. I want everyone start thinking good about others and be calm. Life would become simple and less toxic. In all possibility, you cannot change attitudes of everyone in the world. Thinking better and looking at intellect than other's body or attire would lead to a more tolerant and respectful society.

I don't know much about this topic but I have my opinion regarding this I'm a regular football watcher so I'll give my opinion regarding this felild. See in football male footballs revenue is 10 times or even 20 times greater than female football so how do we expect to give equal salary I do agree on rest of occupations where the work and revenue generated by both genders is equal so equal money should be distributed!
Thankyou sir for the right knowledge

Its a real need of the society to change its perspective from 'Science Supremacy' to social understanding as well And respecting humanities subjects that everyone are taught..."
Well Done Dhruv Rathee!!!
"What you explained is natural behavior of human beings nothing to do with feminism & patriarchy.  Men are trained to be tough & Women to be nurturing.  We currently live in peaceful times and not many wars so making fun of men being tough is encouraged by bunch of soyboys & simps.  During WAR these kind of weak societies will be wiped out by another strong nation and tough times will reset everything back to natural order.
Nature gave men physical strength, speed, agility, mindset is the reason they command more power,   just like nature gave lion, tiger strength & speed and they command in the jungle not dear, buffalo or giraffe.  This is what GOD/Nature wanted and made it this way."

"On paper the term feminism looks very good and must have thing, but in reality the conditions are never ideal, this kind of feminism leads to short term realtionship, ultimately leading to the fall of family culture and promoting hookup culture, so does this kind of feminism will be sustainable for long term consiquences?"

This is the best video so far as a Muslim feminist

"hello dhruv,i dont like the way u only highlited the first few lines of the article,in the same image it clearly says that a wife should also help husband guide through what is right and what is wrong,even though u mentioned the entire article people are not going to read the remaining part and only will only listen or read the part u highlighted and think that sanatan promotes patriarchy,sanatan doesnt promote patriarchy,i mean shiva is called arthanareshwar.and one more thing whenever u mention anything about sanatan please mention the shloka in which its mentioned(from the books which are authentic and not some mistranslation by foreign authors).bcoz people always add their own things in the name of sanatan and try to defame it"
Agar feminism ko me Maan v lu but ghr or society me koi value nhi karega mujhe even me akele ya chote grp of ladki kuch v nhi kar sakti... Ye saare rights chahiye but still it's difficult and might be impossible hai normal hona ye sab🥺🥺

Dhruv my boy when i started watching the video i thought this video will gonna be a big disappointed on your channel but the way you end it solute to you bro
"aap se mai sahamat hu, lekin public transport system me ""Ladies"" ke liye alaga coach or seat reserve hai, kya ye equality/similarity darsata hai?"
"Feminism is abt making both the genders equal like no gender shld be above another both women and men go through shit from society so we shld make them equal. We shldnt make women superior or men superior. Feminism is abt equality. It is abt social, economic etc equality."
"Men Were given Rights to Vote Before women ,because whenever there's a war They will be drafted for military, the voting came at price of life , that they have to die for there country, and what's the point in talking about history now both men and women have voting rights, And Your stating that its patriarchy And you talk about logic, you brought up the past to sound more logical its stupid to talk now about voting rights, And Pay Gap that's a mith(Now there's no wage OR PAY GAP , if there was , ,all business company will Employ women , because its profitable for business company) , On Ground Reality Feminist are Practicing different, and What feminist really is , Now Every women has equal rights, then What are they fighting for? , they got even more advantage  now in  society, Feminist say men should express there emotions (Like crying) And at the same point They want men who's strong, because its biological grinded in women that if they see a men cry they loose attraction towards men, [patriarchy, don't allow men to cry , bullshit, That has nothing to do  with patriarchy] And Women these days got more Powers then men , [you already Know what powers i am talking about given by the stupid law , a law which was created on the basis of history not what's going now ] .... 


Women's Tend to take decisions on How They Feel Rather than what's truth (because biology again) , that's why they terrible decision makers in politics,  
And Don't Compare anything to those shitty Bollywood Movies , Bollywood is fu**inkg Your mind . Women's Already Have Every right That Men Has , then What do They Want ."
"Good
Men patriarchy ke baat karke bhoojh kaam kar diya bhiya aapne"
Ye sirf Hindu grantho ko hi quote kar Raha hai. Bloody liberal
Feminism doesn't mean you will follow the bad traits of men in the name of Equality
Thank you so much druvh sir  😊😊😊😊😊
Dhruv rocked
"Society doesn't need a patriarchal, matriarchal, or even feminist culture, the domain of any of the stated above here will eventually suppress the other. But this is an ideal state, which is close to impossible, as the people want dominance of their race. People have to think about this seriously and what they want to provide for the upcoming generations. What legacy they are going to gift to their children? Greed and the concurrent world scenario play a vital role in what culture the world would adopt and what legacy the people are going to carry forward."
Sandeshkhali par ek video
So sorry Dhruv. This time Not agree
what rights do men have and women dont?
"Islam is an equal religion girl, a boy is equal our prophet married the widow Islam is an equal religion"

"to my fellow brothers main intention of this video is to make you a feminist dont fall for it . doesnt matter what the definition says what feminism implies in todays world are two different things . never call yourself a feminist if you see a women really being oppressed only then help these social things like man have be the main earner is not going to change in your lifespan ,you will be taken advantage of because when you admit you are a feminist girls will only take things that benefit them from the feminist rulebook and use them for their own benefit"

"22:19 kisi thappad marna galat men or women koi bhi hoo, lekin aaj kal zyada divorce women file kar rahi aur man ke wealth se share bhi puchti hai, expenses ke liye paise bhi puchte hai? Kya ye justice hai?"
I appeal every individual should watch this❤
I give millions likes to this video!! More power to you.
21:29 animal aur Kabir singh movies ka affect society ko danger hai lekin four more shots please aur the Home coming movie ka affect society par nahi hoga kya? Ye konsa justice hai?
Men are becoming weaking year after year... Why don't you make video on this topic
"The Dhruv's version of Definition of faminism just missed a simple point ""Equal rights between male and female doesnt mean identicality of roles. I would say a sane person whether a male or a female whether he/she is a feminist or not won't draw an analogy between faminism and patriarchy. This is stupidity. And 3rd wave of faminism is even more nonsensical than this video."
"13:17 agar apki car ko koi damage kartha hai, toh aap sensible man ki tarah silent rahte toh, iska matlab saree police wale, aur army wale, judge, lawyer, sabko apki tarah sensible man banke chup rahna chahiye?  Arey galat ko galat nahi bologe? Agar nahi bolte toh atleast apne dil me toh galat ko galat manoo... Apki baat sune toh sahi aur galat me faraq hi nahi rahega..

toxic feminism se bhi zyada aap jaise logo ki soch se society ko damage hoga.

"The most irritating things we see nowadays are, labeling the woman of our mother's generation as the last generation of innocent women. They're innocent because they're the victims of patriarchy. Stop glorifying them."

Looks like lot of feminists men are there who are ready to go to jail when women will put false rape cases.. In that case i will support women because men don't support men... 😂😂😂
Then answer my question dhruv i know your wife will kick you out if you answer this.... Why women are not punished when they put false rape molestation harrasment dowry allegations and later blackmailing for money... How many women have been hanged in India till now???
Dhruv bhai modi ji India k best feminist ko kyu bhul gaye video me jinhone muslim women ko triple talak se aazadi 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I Am Feminists Bhai ☺️🤗🤗 Me Bhi Humanists Hu Or. Me Nahi Manta Male Female Gender Se Discrimination Hona Chahiye Ham Sab Ek Saman Hai Gender Se Hame Nahi Dekhna Chahiye Bhai
Looks like when women will put false rape molestation harrasment dowry allegations and later blackmailing for money then talk about feminism...
This is how an educated person talks
Time to stand with innocent man ♂️ 🗿
"Hi @dhruvrathee, I have a question. Why do women receive alimony in divorce cases? What needs to be done about this situation?
My friend is going through a divorce, and the woman has abused various laws. She has filed multiple cases, including an FIR against his family, accusing his elderly father of raping her with the help of his mother and the man himself. Why is no one investigating or questioning the woman? The case is now in the Supreme Court for Quashing of FIR (the boy's parents are mentally traumatized by the allegations). Everyone knows the case is false, and she filed it to pressure the boy and his family. Judges are urging them to settle the matter privately.
How can such women dare to file false cases and manipulate the legal system? Why aren't judges questioning the parents about the alleged rape or asking the woman if she's telling the truth? Instead, they're asking the boy to provide alimony and settle the matter. Is this the equality we strive for in society?"
You are great 😊❤
Women don't need equal rights they need proper rights.

"tbh, no one realised how as time went by, women are actually having so much power rn. if 2 people, a male and female, who dont even know each other, pass by each other on a road while walking, and the man does nothing but the woman shouts something, the public will be ready to beat the man without even assessing the situation. On the other hand, even if a woman does something, and the man shouts, the public will ask the woman, confront her, and if she lies that she did not do anything, will again gang up to beat the man without assessing the situation"
"Oops. What a video. Thanks, Dhruv such a great video."
11:05 the real
Dhruv Rathee ko PM banao
"You are a good person by heart.
Ma sha Allah"
"If women working and having a career is feminism, then women choosing to stay at home and looking after their families is also feminism.
There's nothing wrong with women choosing not to work. 

Being a woman myself, I can say that unfortunately its women themselves who have ruined the feminist movement.

Men are suffering everyday because of unfair laws that 'empower' women in terms of divorce, alimony, maintenance, child custody, cruelty.

Where is the equality in that? Why the bias towards women?

I've seen and known women who fight men for their rights but they spend their entire life demeaning and defaming other women. How is that feminism.

Equality is an illusion. What we truly need is mutual respect for all. Irrespective of gender, caste, religion, color and everything else."
"Dhruv Rathee is afraid of Muslims. Hence no word on burqa, halala, child marriages  and triple talaqs. Dhruv Rathee has a jihadi mindset."
"We can make videos but we can never change this mentality. Being a men even after watching these videos, I can never share my feelings and emotions with any other men or even with my family. There's always a feeling of looking weak."
"where does it says patriarchy is defined ""control over women"". you are saying the interpretation to support your narrative. 

I do watch most of your videos and I gain knowledge but I disagree with the interpretation - please give credible evidence of your argument"
"Except Muslims, Dhruv Rathee speaks about all religions and cultures. See how much afraid he is of Muslims. That's why Muslims are backward because they have been kept backward."
आचार्य प्रशांत और आपके विचारों में बहुत समानता है।
"""We know feminism is good, but what about pseudo-feminism and toxic feminists? And why are you always being selective? You could have talked about anti-men laws in India, etc. A wife can cheat on her husband with no consequences, whereas adultery committed by men is a serious offense. There are many instances where abuse by women leads to men's suicides in the majority of cases, but see again, you hypocrite."" Lastly if Wasseypur is a masterpiece then why animal is cancer. I love that movie."
"Thanks, Dhruv sir for making such detailed content about feminism. Wishing you all the happiness you deserve. 😇😇"
Thank you for the English subtitles

"Are sir poori vedio me knowledge about feminine to sirf 2% hi hai, baaki to patriarchal society hai😂😂...bhai kahena kya chahate ho,....dhruv I always teach my students that truth lies in two extreams, so extream feminism is as suicidal to the society as the patriarchy....AND MOST OF ALL, WHEN YOU SAY RIGHTS OF MEN PLEASE TALK ABOUT THEM AND ALSO THE SOCIETY REQUIRES ""EQUITY"" cuz equality is a myth and actually not practical."
Jai hind Jai Bharat ❤️🇮🇳
सच कहूं आप अब हमारा टाइम बर्बाद कर रहे हो
"Excellent video
I'm happy to see that whatever Dhruv shared I think exactly the same about these issues.
I never heard from others but may be because of critical thinking I developed this kind of mindset by myself what all these people like Obama ,Salman , Amir Khan And others have.
But there are a lot of issues because of wrong understanding of feminism
People think that of you are a feminist you are some kind of fool or you are not a man 
😂😂 So usually the people who think like feminists but don't consider themselves a feminist because of this kind of separation from everyone"

"In Islam, both men and women are considered equal in their spiritual worth and accountability before God. They are both regarded as equal partners in worship, responsibility, and reward. However, while Islam promotes equality, it also acknowledges the biological and social differences between men and women, assigning them different roles and responsibilities based on their strengths and abilities. For example:

1. **Spiritual Equality**: Both men and women are equally responsible for fulfilling their religious obligations, such as prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage.

2. **Social Roles**: While men and women have different roles in society, such as caretaking and providing, these roles are complementary rather than superior or inferior. Each gender has its unique strengths and responsibilities.

3. **Modesty and Behavior**: Islam promotes modesty and respectful interaction between men and women. Both are encouraged to lower their gazes and behave with decorum in their interactions with the opposite gender.

4. **Education and Knowledge**: Islam emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge for both men and women. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, ""Seeking knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim,"" thereby emphasizing the importance of education regardless of gender.

5. **Legal Rights**: Islam grants women various legal rights, including the right to inherit, own property, engage in business, and seek divorce under certain circumstances. 

6. **Protection and Respect**: Islam emphasizes the protection and respect of women's rights, including protection from abuse, exploitation, and discrimination. The Quran explicitly condemns any form of violence or injustice against women.

Overall, Islam teaches that men and women are partners in their journey of faith and life, each contributing to the betterment of society and the fulfillment of God's will in their unique capacities."

"Thank you so much for creating this content. As a feminist I cannot explain how deeply saddening it is when even the so called ""educated"" men see feminism as a threat. They do not realize that feminism is not about ""Women should not cook and clean"", rather ""men should also cook and clean"". Its not pitting men against women, but rather pitting gender roles against gender roles and allowing men and women achieve a balanced society where everyone gets to experience humanity- whether it be physical freedom for women or emotional freedom for men."

"A patriarchal society functions much better than a female run society - there are numerous researches on it published in reputed journals. But, that does not change the fact that women deserve equal rights - which includes the right to be not a bread-earner of the family. At the same time an ethical man should never be offended if their spouse contributes financially and earns more than him. Being respectful of each other is important for both the parties."

It is really confusing if I consider both patriarchy and feminist in a bowl and solve them. But really a nice given context about this topic.

Modern feminists only exist on social media to gain popularity.
"Difference between Feminism and knife is, knife has point, but feminism hasn’t."
"Almost Half the world is muslim .
They are patriarchal.
They are proud.
They are unapologetic. 
They are happy."
"Marriage is also a tradeoff .
Man provides security. Woman provides comfort. Children make family.  Support is guaranteed.
But.
Individuality is lost. 

In todays world,  one cult is winnng everywhere because its not giving up on primacy of family and patriarchy. 

No one openly talks about it because all are scared.

Everyone attacks a soft target. 

Hindus are soft target."
But kattar be like no LGBTQ++++++++
Thnku sir for giving informative vdo
"That is not the only problem though. And its pretty basic what you are saying, but you aren't addressing it in detail.  The feminist movement has forgotten feminism and is trying to move towards matriachy and misandry. 

This is not the case in India. But it is in the west. Barbie movie itself is one example where the doll was invented by a woman but they show men as the people who are the problem. And that grosses a billion dollars. 

Just because there is no violence doesn't mean there is no misandry. Animal and Barbie are the same just on 2 different ends. 

Also why call it patriarchy if we are talking about the victims and if you clearly mention that men are also the victims of current system. Why is it that men are blamed for it? Why would men want a system that's harmful to them? Why would they setup a system where they let women go out the titanic first? 

Then now lets be honest, women have had benefits and men have had benefits. Men maybe more and women less. 

the problem is the wording and how this is turning into misandry movement. I don't mind feminism. I support it. BUT the hypocrisy is seen in many elements. and this is such a surface level video."
"Offcourse , I am a female, I do not hate men , I hate indecent men. Either of the extremes,say it  feminism or patriarchy/misogyny are unjust & danger to society . How difficult is it to see other homo sapiens, (your own species)  with the perspective of humanity , human beings with humane perspective . 
Seeing such extreme trends I really wonder , how difficult is it to practice, rationalism & responsibility❓❓."
you skipped the part where women rights laws are misused very badly !
research shi hai brother...good..u did hardwork
Rights are equal but dont judge from body.
"Nice video. But feminism doesn't have an ""impact"" (crash force) on society; it has an _effect_ (you're probably trying to translate असर or प्रभाव). Also, you seem to be pronouncing फ (pha) as ""fa"" (फ़), which is wrong. It's फुले (Phule) and फैलाना (phailana), not ""फ़ुले"" (""fule"") and फ़ैलाना (""failana""). Finally, the word is नहीं (nahin), not ""नही"" (""nahi""). I'm not sure why so many people make these basic mistakes."
"Just imagine ok? Soldier = Enemy  gave me a Bullet i didn’t take it, so the bullet remained with him…Be a gentleman ok? Be a feminist…"

"@DhruvRatheePage
Irrespective of the crime committed by a woman or a man, the punishment should be equal. Just as violence against women is a heinous crime, so violence against men is an equally heinous crime. But if justice is done to women, if the man does not get any justice or if the responsibility is unilaterally imposed on the man, then That too is an injustice. Crimes committed by men are just as unjust, crimes committed by women are equally unjust.

Regardless of gender, see crime as crime.

Have you thought that if a woman falsely accuses you in the court, you will be punished just because you are a man, but if a woman wrongs you, she will not be punished?

But in the eyes of the law the criminal is punishable according to his crime irrespective of gender.

I hate both sexual racisms equally.

So I believe in the rights both women and men as they deserve."

Feminism don't exist  because we can't go against the nature . Man and woman is not equal which people support feminine they or transgender or else fake girls supporter if this guy really love and support then he earning so much money what is doing our county
"But believe it or not, in today's time there are many women who take the benefits of feminism from the wrong perspective. 👋"
The sigh of relief i had after watching this video .....and still that frustration that ...will people ever gonna change?🙂
Excellent Job Dhruv.. Respect From Pakistan. Neda Baog Here
I think so bacche toh aurat hi paida aur ghara sambhlaana dono ki jimmdari but pur aghar aurat pe depand rehta backi sab roght hai
Dude feminism is actially becoming a problem day by day becoz they not only want equal right they actually hate mens
"Just imagine guys how easy the family finance will get if our mom and sisters would have also been in some earning process some might have solved it for small and  some might even have solved it for the whole family but what actually happens there hard work that only limits till looking for household works there smartness only limits till her kitchen she is not taught of any passion or hobbies bcos the society teach and fill in there mind that only looking after the house is your only hobby u can have 
this can't be changed suddenly but we now are enough educated to know the reality and the real ideal human we can be so this idea  might be not applicable to our moms its already too late but it can be for our daughters or our wife so atleast a future will be a better place to live 
Thank you 🤗🤗"
Nicely Plotted Facts with Relevant example... Good Job Bro...
Facts
Love u dhruv I like u first Time actually win my mind because of girls boys have been became berojgar Few decades back one person earned and family not but nowdays girls earned and expected boys should earned 5 times more than them. If girl earns 1 crore she expect maximum 5 crore minimum 2 crore sorry maximum no limits if girl have 2 cars boy should have 4 cars minimum maximum no limits and ultimately girls  got sympathy girls want more and expect gender equality

"People say that “A single mom or dad can also make a child grow as a good person”
That's false 
No I'm not a gender inequality supporter 
I think there's a reason why god made the pair of humans to live together as male and female 
A mother can make her son grow as a good boy but he will always be a good mama's boy 
It requires a dad to teach him at a certain age what he should do at times and makes him efficient to be able to manage his own family and therefore that's how he also becomes a dad
Anda mother also has a important role which I guess we all know 
Thank you"

"I believe it's crucial to acknowledge and appreciate the inherent differences between men and women. While it's true that both genders possess unique strengths, it's essential to recognize that these strengths often manifest differently. Men tend to excel in areas requiring physical strength and endurance, which historically led to their dominance in tasks like construction and agriculture, and every other field that requires more physical presence, just look around and think about it when you're walking on the roads made my men and looking at the buildings and eating the food that you're about to put in your mouth

Women possess innate qualities that make them exceptional caregivers and nurturers. Their emotional intelligence and empathy equip them well for roles such as motherhood and caretaking. These differences aren't indicative of superiority or inferiority but rather complementarity.

The notion of patriarchy, often misunderstood, reflects not a system of oppression but rather an acknowledgment of historical roles and contributions. Regarding decision-making and emotional management, there is indeed differences in approach between men and women. Men often prioritize logic and rationality in decision-making, while women considers emotional factors more prominently. Men and women have traditionally played distinct but equally valuable roles in society, contributing to its functioning in different ways

In modern society, there's a growing trend towards open-mindedness and inclusivity, which is commendable. However, this openness should not come at the expense of disregarding biological and psychological realities. Embracing diversity of thought and perspective while respecting biological differences is key to fostering a balanced and harmonious society.

I hope you guys understand what I'm trying to say here, I'm not deragarding femism, I'm just acknowledging apparent facts and logic here"
It's not about feminism... It's about humanity ❤

"The freedom and power should be given to deserving ones, who are mature enough to take responsibilities, contribute to home and society.      The ultimate agenda should be to make family and society stronger.  If we allow one section of our society (who is critical influencer at home and with children) to be weak, the society or family will be weaker by 50%.    Rather than following any ideology we should be practical and rational.   At least poor class, lower middle class and middle class cannot afford uneducated - non working wives.  People are loosing jobs due to ever changing technology world.  In that case if a woman is educated, she can support her family.   If a man cannot earn for family, he should take over domestic responsibilities and vice versa.    Few women use their husband's money to spend on luxuries, that is not real feminism.   Be strong and contribute - that is way of life!"

What about equality of punishment ?
"after hearing about the true definition of feminisim I can proudly say Islam gave all the rights to women more than 1400 years ago where girls used to be burried alive , men used to use them for thier lust , they were never given the right in property , they we never given the right in marriage.  but Islam gave all these rights to women with dignity.  
But Sadlt, In Pakistan , in the name of feminism there is ony promotion of hatred towards Men , Hatred aginst your own brother , father & Husband . promotion of nudity irrespective of what kinda a religion or culture that specific society follows , they only have one motto of Mera Jism meri Marzi with the concept of whatever I want to do I will do . irrespective of its consequences   it being right or wrong ."
💚🇧🇩
first time i felt this guy is a simp
Very nice video
Today I understood the real meaning of feminism and patriarchal expectations.
"You have touched so many points on a touch and go . And given ur narrative . However kindly explain this confusion. 

I presume laws and rights are equal for man and women . There is no law that a man has that a women dosent in general . ( Mind u I am stating facts mainly of usa as all this is passed down from there ) 

Inspite of that the sentences given to women are lesser than man for same crime. Divorce and family courts over whelmingly favour women against men. 

Women don't have the burden of proof and are taken at face value where as the burden of proving innocence falls on a man no matter what the case .  Exceptions are always there not interested in that. I am talking on majority. 

Where is the equality in that. 

These movies of feminist that u mentioned which u brushed off. The sad reality is that this is the wave of feminism that is present now . 1st wave and 2 nd wave feminism is all gone. 

A very important point u refused to elaborate on . When women are brought up educated and pushed in society to be strong empowered and independent . Ask the question who are they independent from.  They are brainwashed to think and act that way . U think they will change after enjoying all the benefits of no accountability. 

Men on the other hand have to work hard so that people can be dependent on him. And end of the day if he fxks up nobody is coming to save him or marry him .
You put down these playboys. Agreed . But u forget what they are able to do or people like them are very few percentage wise . However u forget no matter what u say women are attracted to them and not the nice guys.  Women are  attracted to these traits yet complain when the man exhibits exactly what she was attracted to.  

Now to ur female fans . No matter what rules the feminst brings in the dating market. It's the same percentage of successful men that are gonna enjoy even more  women than they presently are .  However the nice guys simple guys etc etc etc  will keep loosing out. It is exactly like the rich will get richer and poor just gets poorer. 

Also no known so called western ""feminists"" are fighting for men rights etc. they don't care about men . Infact the trend now is I don't need a man . I will freeze my eggs.  This is not an equality movement my friend. Wait and watch how this keeps getting worse in India . It's only a start. 

Usa figures are out 45 ,% Of women age of 40 will be single and childless by 2030-2035 .  That's superb news thanks to the feminist movement and society pushing strong and independent women. 

Society pushes women to be strong and men to be dial down ie be weak.  What else do expect  apart from suicides and loneliness . 😎

It is a sad reality and we all will face the brunt of it ."
Feminism has ruined society and that's the truth accept it or reject it

"I am a big fan of yours dhruv.
But what is the point in making vedio on these kind of useless topics. There are plenty of other important issues related to our country.
My only request to you is please avoid these kind of useless topics.
A big chunk of your subscribers are students and they want to see topics related to current affairs and education value topic.😊"
"We should also differentiate between ideals and practice.Ideal feminism is good but look at the practice. There are a lot of rabid feminists who have grabbed the light away from sensible one and their views are what are amplified in the mainstream. That is why feminism has a negative connotation attached with it. 
So I'm not  a ""feminist"". I consider every human being has an equal worth and take my decisions based on that. Also feminism still has a lot of contradictions. A simple idea of equality is enough for me functioning in the world"
🎉❤😊
I agree with dhruva Rathee
Feminism is cancer for society as much as films like Animal.
Please make a video related to dressing style like urfi Javed... that's also fake feminism 😅
"Do any one know about any animal specie in which males and females have same jobs? If anyone know please tell me so that i can learn something new. Its not about rights, I agree that every gender should have equal right but it is not necessary that you push male and female to do same jobs if a girl wants to be a housewife, let her be a housewife don't force her to be feminist and same for the one who wants to be a politician or a sportswoman or whatever she wants let her be.
I still appreciate you for this video despite some disagreements."

The term feminism doesn't sound like anything equal, instead it sounds something to be a female oriented movement. That's why misunderstanding is seen everywhere. I think the problem is with how the word 'Feminism' sounds. 
It should be changed into 'Gender equality', then most of the population will be able to understand the term and will definitely feel connected."

"I agree about a lot of things said in this. But as a college student this feministic approach where girls have seats secured in colleges, where boys have to wait a long time to secure an intern or a job at the same time the process for girl's is easier. I have seen girls justify this with reasons such as girls suffer menstruation and stuff. basically women are getting a considerable competitive edge over men and how can this be equal then? I am not here to argue or judge any opinions just in case anyone feels anything wrong about this but like I am open to good valid points to tackle this."
Bang on Target.
"Hello dhruv sir. I leave in bengal, well the issue i’m gonna put here is the national issue i guess. In every part of india when we travel into the bus rather private buses, they oftenly use a particular sitting arrangement named ladies seats. Where only and only the ladies should be allowed to have a seat & the rest of the seats are general seats. Where not only men but also women are allowed to be seated. This isn’t an example of patriarchy??? This one should be according to my gatherings from this video"
Bloody I don't like this video 😡😡😡
Being girl I don't support such feminists. ❤️ Agree with dhruv

Taking examples from 1950 and 60s to advocate or sugarcoat the wrongs happening today is dangerous. What exact rights do men have that women don't? Society's conditioning cannot happen through law. A smart man and a dumb man are different and get paid differently. Your DEI agenda and clubbing all feminist as just peace loving and not dominating is just misleading. But hey that is what you always do.

You said about gurud puran why not bible and quran?
"Feminism thrives to give equal rights but we never see feminist women working labour jobs, midnight taxis, border security, front army. Why?

Patriarchy is based on human nature that we have lived for thousands of years. If you change that into modern feminism, alot of things will change overtime and gender roles wouldn’t exist. Similar to what’s happening in the US. Compare white men to Middle Eastern men. White men are becoming weaker and are losing their masculine role in the society, this is only going to make another power to control the society easier. Like the government. Strong men are the authority."

@dhruvrathee women who do wrong thinks aren't backed by feminists but we also expect feminist to stand by man's side when he is right and women is wrong. There are many cases where if a girl suffers even masculinists support a girl but feminists never speak for men. What about that?

"This video never mentioned that when govt tried to make rape gender neutral, feminist groups stopped it. It never mentioned rape under false pretense of marriage or plight of men. Feminism means equality of rights for women, it would be called egalitarian if it was about equal rights for everyone. This was just complete virtue signaling. Movies like animal are toxic, so is burying you head in sand about toxic feminism like a generic leftist."

"I just want to live life the way my parents or grandparents lived. In their time, men were taking responsibility of external affairs and women took responsibility of home and kid's affairs. Both men and women had their sufferings. Neither man nor the woman had very comfortable life then. However, their mind and bodies are conditioned through ages of evolution as well as coaching by elders. Except for some injustices towards women, and sometimes men, it was bit easier for both of them as responsibilities were clearly outlined. Most jobs were only to be taken by men, and these men could marry women to take care of them and share the prosperity from the earnings.

But feminism produces a confusion as to who is responsible for the external affairs of earning and internal affairs of managing home and raising kids. Jobs are already reducing due to automation and machines, besides closure of many govt posts. And with girls taking the few jobs, it becomes difficult for men to get jobs. Now with women settling for less pay, or securing a job by unleashing her sensuality on a male hiring manager, it becomes easier for women to procure a job. Men are forced to join a less paying job or become a shopkeeper. Do you really assume that girl who gets a high paying job settles for any guy of a lower salary or work? How many woman want to continue their job until retirement of age 60? Some may normalize it but reality is way different.

How many times do you notice a woman proposing a man? It's always a man's risk to be mocked for his inadequacies. The fact is even the feminist woman actually believes in patriarchy only.

I support the abolition of sati, right for women's education and suffrage, women's right to choose her partner, etc.. but beyond these I don't see much of a purpose in reservation for women in jobs, legislative seats, and engineering college seats, etc.. If you got talent grab these on merit only. 

There are countless videos on social media where western women are sharing their pain on how they are frustrated carrying the feminist flag and fighting men. I certainly do not want that to happen with my people."
I'm Shocked How Can This Man Explain This Type Of Topic In So Confideint & Easy Way I Mean Everything He Said & Tried To Make Us Understand Is Just Fablous

"Finally someone who actually understands feminism. People believe everything they see on social media and always insult feminists even women. When I said I didn't like Animal, they said ""feminist ho kya"" and it was a girl, when I said cheating is wrong, they said ""boys will be boys"" and we have to accept that we can't stop them from having such ""thoughts"" for other girls and when I tried to argue they said ""feminist hai kya"" . When I said that my mother taught both me and my brother all the house chores and my brother probably cooks better than me and that's how it should be everywhere they were like yeh ladkiyo ka kaam hai ""feminist hai kya"". Ha hun feminist koi problem."

"This is over simplified. I agree that feminism by definition promotes equality and true feminists just want the end of patriarchy but the ground reality is very different and the support many women get from feminism just becomes the abuse of power. 

For example, it is very likely for an employed man to marry an unemployed woman than vice versa. Statistically, 75% of women won't marry an unemployed man and an unemployed man is 33% more likely to get divorced.

What many women do here is that they use the movement of feminism to fight for example ""Equal employment opportunity"" and after they get a job, they return to their patriarchal mindset and suddenly wouldn't like to marry a jobless man. 
Events like these are the reason why feminism in the current world has become a useful tool for vicious women who instead of promoting equality use it for their personal gains."

"I ABSOLUTELY DENY THE FACT THAT MEN AND WOMEN ARE SAME.

Please don't misunderstand it.
Yes I am a biologist and, I want you to understand carefully. In this scenario we are talking social values, not natural values. We are  taking about Social Hierarchy and diversity Not Taxonomic Hierarchy and Biodiversity.
WOMEN AND MEN ARE NOT SAME THAT IS WHY THEY NEED EACH OTHER.
If we were biologically same then we wouldn't do Sexual reproduction, we would have done conjugation instead (like bacterias do).
Socially Speaking, What we need is not equality but Equal opportunity.
Even if we have most of the same organs that doesn't mean we have the same capability. Some people are good at something some are not, regardless of their gender.
That is why what we need is ""Equal Opportunity"" not forced equality.
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND."
Chapri gang should be banned because it is spread or wrong information among viewers
"Islam is the most feminist religion.

Obviously im joking, 
The fact that dhruv rathee failed to mention the literacy rate and employment rate of muslim women in India and the rest of the world is quite strange.

Women being supressed and indoctrinated into a mere cloth because a certain sky donkey named allah would burn them in hell for eternity must the most feminist thing ever."
Today all women are sell their body on onlyfans all women are naked in social media

"I find south indian men more comfortable with their emotions and feelings. It is not common in tamil, telugu or malayalam to shame men if they express weak emotions like in Hindi. Females have had almost equal say in the households. I find south indian men leaning more towards natural feminism than north indian men. It could be because women's education was given importance and they raised more secure men."

"Tbh 
The definition of feminism nowadays is actually differs from one what it actually have.
Or it's not wrong to say that the so called feminists of nowadays are nothing but the one who are having mindsets of Matriarchial society.
As they want everything which is not wrong but at the same time in need of everything or in name of everything the fake allegations are very common on men nowadays this is the harsh truth and yes it is.
They  don't wanna show that what they are or of what they actually capable of but if found guilty in something four tears out allegations blames imposed and hence this is what the actual definition of feminism is nowadays."
You literally roasted capris in an educational way😂
The main issue is with modern women feminism which want men to be erased or set unreal standards for men to be with them lol

"I am sorry to say, This video could not bring out the true meaning of Feminism as perceived in Bharat. To point out the exact failures in the content of the video, 1. Highlighting Western concepts of psychology - They do not exactly coi-relate to Bhartiya People. 2. No historical background of Bharat towards these issues except a few greats who removed the evils from society, 3. Bharat has evolved completely differently then rest of the world, here patriarchal notions do not  coin-side with western world, In Bharat Women hold a sacred place in society although they did face a lot of music, the general evolution of women were Dharmic altogether. Hence, i would suggest dig deep before coming uout with sensetive topics and stop following western trends. Over all i have been a dedicated subscriber of this channel and i do want to see this channel be a mirror to profit making journalism. ... UD...."

"There are so many loopholes in what Dhurv is presenting, that it's so tedious to even list them out. He is simply pandering to the feminist groups. He did not even once mentioned how weaponised feminism of today is. Labeling everyone opposing the feminazis as chapri instragram ke ladke shows his maturity. There is a lot of guys who do not appreciate cheating, whether done by boy or girl. Guys don't fall this this propaganda. Stand up for yourself always when you are right."

There is lot of toxic femism going on.. 
The orginal intent of equal rights is lost long back.
You have not reserched properly about the toxic part of feminism going on, it's no more about equality, they r just using it to oppress men and they  validate there wrong doing in the name of feminism."

I want to ask that if feminism is about giving equal rights to both men and women. Than there is a temple in India where the deity menstruates every month and men are not allowed to visit at that time period. Will be count this as rights that should be given to men under feminism?
why didnt u talked about alimony and child support and how a women can just accuse someone for r4pe and the entire man life also the court is so unfair to men also how there is 40 percent quota for women in higher post also talk about how men became weaker s3x in scandanavia because how feminist it is
I don't think men understand that feminism has given so much more to Men than eveb women

"Dhruv Rathee hypocrisy:- he can quote garur puran to describe how women should be but cannot quote Quran or sharia law. This shows that who you are, what your hidden intention is. If you show something then you shouldn't cover up things."

man and woman can't be equal 
offcourse they are similar  yes they deserve full rights but it doesn't mean that woman should rule over man 
Allah created man stronger and guard of his woman .
but if giving rights to woman is feminism that i am a feminist but not giving rule over man"
you miss the business behind it its all about mens business women are just their toys
😂😂😂
Nice video 👍👍❤️
Feminism is cancer
"You should also talk what Sharia says about women. How women are not allowed to worship in Mosques? How they are asked to wear hijabs? How they treated? Why polygamy is only allowed for males and Halala is there for women? But of course you will talk only about Hindu women not treated fairly. 
Patriarchy exists in both Hinduism and Islam and it would ve been great if you talked about both. I am against Patriarchy beliefs existing in both. But your videos are always against Hindus."
"Uff... At the age of 50, today I understood

These movies gives wrong directions and influenced  both genders some in negative sense and some positive sense . No one know about real feminism .
Great explanation. Well researched and explained both sides of the issue.
"There's a differnce  of physical power when one raises hand on the other gender. It is not about raising hand, it is about respect of every person who is different than the other. It is rightly said that the main commonality between every race (men, women, caste language, ehtnicity) is that all are different and diverse. Respect everyone for their identity. The opposite of patriarchy, matriarchy or feminism is EQUALITY. 
WHICH ACCEPTS THE DIFFERENCE OF EVERYBODY ACKNOWLEDGING THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH OF A MAN AND THE DELICATE WOMAN. 

When any one uses harsh tone of voice or raises hand on the other gender, it should never be called matriarchy, patriarchy or feminism, it should simply be called WRONG."

Feminism was very much influenced by the CIA via Gloria Steinem and the like.

The agenda was to use 'female empowerment' as a facade to disenfrachise the 'father' figure and make everyone beholden to the whims of a few billionaires.

The result can be seen in the unnaturally high levels of suicide and loneliness in young men."

"As a girl, I feel glad that people are opening up more about men's right and heavier expectations that are placed on men by the patriarchal society. I also have a Brother and a Father and I can totally relate to the stuff you said about Men's loneliness and inability to express emotions due to conditioning of society. I think the term ""Feminism"" should be replaced with something sounding more gender-neutral,  otherwise pseudo-feminists who are often averagely educated will keep whining about it in female perspective only and this will only broaden the gap between males and females, rather than bringing us together."

"The most shameful practise in modern patriarchal society is women should work for financial support and husband's claims to have all rights on wife's money but not vice versa. And with women working, mem are becoming more irresponsible towards home matters. I salute those men who are feminist."
Dhruv's video should be added in school's curriculum.
This video was much needed. ❤
Men are from mars and women are from venus. Is book me diya hai ki jab women independent ho jati hai to uska ego badh jata hai or divorce bad jate hai. Aaj kal yehi ho raha hai.

4: ranvijay is shown touching Gitanjalis feet's and staying there multiple time
5: ranvijay fights with his jija for mistreating his sister and not letting her work 
Now how is he a woman hater? Like every thing he does is opposite of what you say"
Very informative.... well explained
So feminism is a misnomer
Why you don't talk about Muslim girls. They are surpresses. Muslim women live in hell. But dhruv rathee never talks of Muslim culture.

Easy going you took the topic and made 90 percent video supporting stupidity. You have seen why families were more happy in the past. Because the roles and responsibilities were divided. The competition is built by Rich people pehle Ek job k liye Pehle sirf men compite karte thein and Pay were good. While now man and Woman both are competing for the same job and now the company will make less pay because competition has got increased. The system is controlling you.

Men are the in charge of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women and tasked with supporting them financially.

"committed fallacies like steel manning, straw manning, this is the problem with youtube videos on topics like these, both right wing and left wing creators commit bunch of fallacies. He didn't say anything about 300000  years of evolutionary history, hypergamy, divorce laws in India, everything wrong everywhere is still because of Patriarchy. Doesn't matter if it's patriarchy or feminism every ideology created by humans has it's pros and cons, maybe one has more pros than the other. He didn't talk about overton window and fourth wave feminism, He didn't give a single example that is bad about feminism. I am not a patriarchal nor a feminist, because as Bertrand Russell said ""I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong""."

Your problem is that all negative example you give from BJP and associated org and all positive from party or people against BJP. While content is good but intent doesn’t look good.
Well done bro

"patriarchy is built in nature 
no one can fight with nature

there will be no family system"
Thank you.
"Hi Dhruv..love your videos man.., was hoping if you could talk about the LGBTQI+ community as it really confuses me a lot. My mindset related to feminism got clear after watching this video and I am hoping the same for the LGBTQI+ topic. It would be of great help. Thanks a lot for keeping up with good work:)"
❤❤
thank you so much for making a video on this topic for I had been sick of retarded losers portraying feminism as something it isnt just to depopularize it
"I disagree with you with some points.
I support that woman should be free and should have equal rights in the society. But Man is made stronger. He can face many situations  better then women and similarly women is better in some situations. They should play their role. Man should earn his and his family living. If Woman want to contribute she can also do a job or something to help. Similarly sometimes In household work men should help women. I think Patriarchy is not bad because it is a system of society or government in which the father or eldest male is head of the family but in this system women should be free and men should not constrain women for something she wanna do.
This was my opinion If anyone want to reply I'll appreciate it"
Ladhki ki video jada viral hoti hai but ladhko ka nhi ladhke talent pr jate hai aur ldhkiya body dhikha kr famous ho jati hai ladhke mehnt pr mehnt krte hai mgr koi NHI like krta

Keep going. Very good video. Rightly said feminism is mocked off by using wrong movies and incidents.
Thanks Dhruv for making this❤ Glad to see people who have great power and influence fearlessly  use it for the right reasons.
Im a MAN.. I ain't weapon..
amazingly describe the right and correct description of such a sensitive issues in our society. good work
I am feminist!
Thanks for this video sir😊😍💙💚💛💜💕💗💖
"feminism ideology is seemed one sided in practical life but looks good in books and these reasearches . in real life true feminism as stated as equal rights cant be there as follwing board points
1} feminsm talks about equalitiy but as all we know govement supports only women as reservation is given to men
a)recently womens one third reservation in lok sabha bill was passed where as becoming a memmber of lok sabha is a pure intrest of anyone i understarnd that women should be given chances but resrvation is not the absolute way
2} as we know many many and many laws of harassesment divorces etc are made for women no such made is for men 
and many more are there but im m tired of typing byee"
"Btw just adding one more point 
talking about mhatma gandhi he was a preson who usually had a patracial mindset in all his movements women . such as in civil disobedience women were significant part of movement and helped to burn foreign clothes and pickted liquor shops. but altough their participation when it came to giving political rights gandiji objectified their work as of to do house hold chores and nourish their children  .....         
not against him but stated facts thnks"

I have listen those words in reality uske tu kam hai kya and many more words from society comment on other person.
"Your statement seeks 
In essence, we recognize and honor living beings not by their physical appearance, but by the essence of their souls. As Lord Krishna elucidates in the Bhagavad Gita (5.18), a humble sage, endowed with true knowledge, perceives with equal vision the intrinsic value in all beings, whether it be a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog, or even a dog-eater. This perspective encourages us to see beyond the superficial differences and acknowledge the universal spirit that animates every form of life."

"I aggre with you but 
Sarkar ne ab equlity nahi rakhi 
Mens and womens me kyuki 
Bus me discount for women 50% .
For mens 0% 
Education me bhi girls ko  discount hai boys ko nahi 

Sarkar ki vajh se job to kam ho gayi hai aur uper se mahgai alag hai 

Last baat suno
 jab bhi election ane vale hote hai tab sab log womens ke liye koi na koi skim leke ate hai  
Kabhi ladko ke liye koi yojna leke kyu nahi ate ?"
Thank you dhruv sir 🙏🙏🙏
👍👍
"It's absolutely unjust if u subject a strong man and an amputee to do the same task. Though they are similar or nearly equal. I believe in EQUITY rather than EQUALITY. And remember, scientifically nature does have a HIERARCHY! That's how it operates."
Exactly 💯💯

Asa a Pakistani Muslim i can tell that he is real feminist although there are some things that i don't like about him but yeah he is a good feminist
Apki baatein sun k lg rha h jaise apke through main bol rhi hu ....main bhi aisa hi sochti hu ..😊
He is too far away from ground reality
Relax guys he is pressurized by his wife nothing serious just family things😷
Make a video on bjp plan and Farmer's protest @dhruv rathee
"There's a Marathi movie named ""Anandi Gopal"", It beautifully portrays what real feminism means."

Ye aaj ka kissa hai.... Aur bhi hai purane .."
What is chhapri dhruv bhai?
Thankyou . That's all I'll say and it pretty much sums up what I'm feeling right now.
"I also support women's equal rights. But there are some points when we see a numbers of fake rape cases, domestic violence against men, and lost  road rages due to some womens like the one mentioned in the video. Some fake police complaints. The womens who called themselves feminist are actually being matriarcha. And govt and society also given so much power to them that men these days are becoming unsafe. 
Please also make videos on this topic if possible. Love from Assam ❤"
My heart is thanking you for this video❤️🙏🏻
Bhai mere bhai ne dahej 0% liya tha 3 Saal pahle aavi divorce huaa bo bhai ki property  50% le gai
Opposite gender of man is women what is the opposite of feminist
"Sir please also talk about pseudo feminism. Some laws have been made to protect women, while there are some women who always take advantage of these laws. Because of them, genuine cases against women are not addressed properly. People believe that all women are like that!"
Sir !! I just want to know ... About any 3 laws which are for men and not available for women in Indian constitution. If anyone knows plz tell me and if not then .....................I am speechless
100% right 👍🙏

Hope u also inspired by lt. Kamla basin.
I hate feminism
"14:55 here I say that not just boys by humans shouldn't cry. If you see there are barely any benefits of crying I just think you may feel sad but you must work out a solution, that's the reason why humans are advanced in comparison to other species we always try to find solutions it is our nature we must embrace and the very reason we are on top of the food chain"
Chlo sab man liya lekin jis din women berozgar male se shaadi krna shuru on mass rate jaisa male krte hai mai feminism accept kr lunga

Sir apko political join kro 👍👍👍
Totally agree that Patriarchy is affecting men but feminism doesn’t do anything to tackle any men’s issues. Give me one instance where Feminists are working on men’s issue? For your information Cassie Jaye was a Feminist and not is a Feminist.
🙏👏👍👌💕🇮🇳🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Aur rhi baat Neha dupiya wali video pr to larkiyon agar unko sahi nhi bola to usko galat bhi to nhi bola sb saant pta h unko galat keh rhi h aur ladke ko sahi kyu nhi bola phir chup kyu kya ek human ka farz hota h sahi ka sath de nhi jab apne feminism pe baat aati h to women rights are jb karka sahi to uska bhi support kro aakhir Kar ho to insaan hi phir kahenge women and men equality are jb tum sirf larkiyon ka support kro aur karko ke case mein wo sahi h to saant raho to kahe ki equality
"cannot agree more , every statement he says it is absolutly correct"

11:24 is the truth
Everything has its positive and negative side. . While feminism is giving opportunities to women yet most of the women are taking adv.of being a woman in todays world. . .no matter evn if its against the morals n ethics of the society. . .many woman are corrupt in their doings in the name of feminism. . They're literary accusing their husband n his family for properties n wealth. .its good that a woman should be heard but evn a man should be heard.. . If a man has to go for a date in the court evn that woman should be present but the court doesnt give a damn if the accuser is present or not.   Evn if she doesnt come for an entire year no warning is given to her while the man is to be present on every date OTHERWISE he'll be arrested. . What kind of justice n equality is this kind of feminism

"Hi  Dhruv Bhaiya please make a detailed video on percentile system used in NTA JEE mains

There is about 85 Mark's difference for 99%ile in jee mains 2024 January attempt
Where one who scores 230 in one shift does not get 99%ile,but another getting 99%ile at just 150...
To be noted, It's not dependent on level of hardness as exam conducted on Feb 1 evening was also on easier side than 30 jan ..
There is something worry and concerning
I request you to make a detailed video on it .
Like it so that it'll be noticed by dhruv bhaiya  and if you see my message plz comment dhruv Bhaiya"
Brother your videos are too good and very informative…
Aek aisa law bataao jo bss maleness ko badhawa deta ho...or female ko supress krta ho...🧐🧐
"explained well but at first there should be no feminism required. As the leaders of feminism or lost the real feminism cause. fact is men and women cant survive without each other, God made both to do different work in their life.  we all are in between Good and Evil choosing right path is the only way."

I also support your motive of video but over feminism and wrong feminism is not for good for our society.
Are you a Feminism (comment)
"This patriarchy and feminist debate is a total mess. I am Muslim women and I believe both men and women are equal but not similar and both should have equal opportunities but not same responsibilities. Here I would say respect should be given to every work I.e., primary responsibility of a man is to earn and primary responsibility of a women is to do good upbringing of a child ( I don’t mean household work or any type of work, I mean to be available to a child for the child’s emotional needs. To teach the child moral things good and bad thing) but not everyone has the same situation so both husband and wife can cooperate with each other as per their situation. If a man is not able to work due to health issues or if he is not able to find work or if he is less educated than wife or due to any circumstances the wife can work and vice Versa. Bringing up a future generation is the biggest responsibility so don’t belittle it by comparing it with washing dishes or mobbing g the floor."

"I was always confused with these terms. Thank you bro. I love your perspective and mindset. You're very independent minded. Not to mention that each of your words are so strongly shown by relevant and specific statistics, I love it. I'd love to know about how you go about researching on these topics. How do you manage to gather so much information about it? What's your content creation process like?"

"I agree!! patriarchy has affected all of us. But toxic feminism is also true. People doing immoral and unethical stuff in the name of feminism should be addressed. If a man is accused of absuing a woman(if he did not), the feminist character assassinate the individual and when proven not guilty hold no accountability of the damage caused to him. it cannot be simply rubbed it off by saying it is not related to feminism. the title should be Decoding Patriarchy"
Asks for a video about Toxic Feminism....... proceeds to makes a video about patriarchy.

Very good explaning and describing
इस देश का नहीं पूरी दुनिया का बेड़ा गर्ग फेमिनिज्म कर देगा जब कुदरत ने फर्क किया है तो आदमी उसको एक जैसा क्यों कर रहा है यह बहन चोद वह कर रहे हैं जो साले सेक्स नहीं करते यहां कम करते हैं उसकी बीवी जधर मर्जी जाए एक तो वह है साले दूसरा वह लेडिस है जो फेमिनिज्म  फेमिनिज्म करती है जो अंदर से पूरी तरह औरत होती ही नहीं है  सभी ने अपने हस्बैंड को छोड़ रखा है बड़ी बड़ी पॉलिटिशियन देख लो वह चाहती है आदमी कुत्ता बन के रहे उनके साथ सेक्स भी अपनी मर्जी से करती है जब दिल करता है सबसे बड़ी सेक्स की बात यह है कि आदमी को पहले कुछ नशा वगैरा करना पड़ता है या कोई आयुर्वेदिक या कोई और जो सेक्स पावर उनकी बढ़ा सके आदमी का लंड  उसको उठाना पड़ता है डंडे जैसा होना चाहिए दूसरी बात आउट नहीं होना चाहिए लंबी पारी या नॉट आउट होना चाहिए लेकिन दूसरी तरफ औरत को ऐसा कुछ नहीं करना पड़ता उससे पहले कोई खास तैयारी नहीं करनी। सेक्स बहुत ज्यादा भी अच्छा नहीं है और ना करना भी अच्छा नहीं है।  फेमिनिज्म से अच्छी औरतों का नुकसान होता है जो बुरी औरतें इसका फायदा उठाती है और अच्छी औरतें फेमिनिज्म चाहती भी नहीं।  तुम जो छपरी छपरी कर रहे हो। फेमिनिज्म को वही मर्द सपोर्ट करता है जो हिजड़ा होता है नपुंसक होता है कमजोर होता है सेक्स में औरत भी वही फेमिनिज्म चाहती है जिसकी अच्छी तरह ठुकाई नहीं हुई या फिर उसको सबर नहीं एक से आजकल जो परिवार टूट रहे हैं वहा फेमिनिज्म बहुत बड़ा करण है जो अच्छी औरत होती है वह अपने घर को स्वर्ग बना देती है ।  हिंदुस्तान में तो औरत को पूजा भी जाता है आजकल किसी औरत के पास थोड़ी सी पावर आ जाए तो वह अपने आप को क्या समझती है लेकिन दूसरी तरफ देखो माता पार्वती लक्ष्मी माता सरस्वती माता जिनके पास अनलिमिटेड  पावर है लेकिन वह फिर भी वह अपने पतियों के साथ है हिंदुस्तानी संस्कार अपने देवी देवताओं से लेना चाहिए
"Finally I understand the true meaning of pentarchy and feminism
Thank you sir❤️🙏
But in case of the harsh jobs that men do, female don't talk about the equality , Why??
🤔"
"I am for equal rights for every human. That being said, i dont think it aint wrong to want to be ideal.
Heck! I, a 32 year old, aspire to be an ideal man every single day."
I don't agree with you....
guru amardas ji was also a feminist he stopped sati pratha
Agar feminism equality hai toh equality hai...Mera lora. Aur upar se Alpha Male ka against mai bol raha hai abe akal se andha Alpha Male toh Siddharth Shukla bhi tha magar vo phir bhi equality mai belive karta tha. Mai apna ek honest point of view bolta hu Jis bhi desh mai women ko rights dia gai wha ki adha se zadi ladkiya r@ndi baan gyi Ex: America iss chiz se tum deni nahi kar sakta. Mai chata hu ki ladkiya ko bhi equal rights mile magar wahi ladkiya phir rights ka misuse karte hai aur ek sl*t jase kapde phente hai etc. Iss se accha toh patriarchy he hai. Mai women ka against nahi agar unko bana he hai toh Rani lakshmi bai jaise mahan aurata bane na ki sunny leone jaise Randiya.
Hope every Man's thinking in the world be like Dhruv then all women will get equal rights
"Superb .... Dhruv sir ,,❤❤❤ur thinking point is so high. ..."
"Then why called feminist
I support equality"
I will not support LGBTQ+ when  even dhruv rathee tells  me to 😅😅

"Dhruve is right at his side, but the thing is in this new youth generation, females have equal rights equal opportunity and even more than boys in many categories(exams, etc) . But some(not all) girls are the same, and the same for boys. It's just about mindset. All boy are different and all girls are different. We should not create girls and boys category😅"

Amazing video sir🤗🤗
Dhurav rathi ko Mufti Yasir Nadeem ki debate sunna chahiye
I agree with Dhruv here! All that he said . But a point to consider- isn’t is written by nature that human being are patriarchal? Agreed it’s men and women who propagate all that - but maybe all that is pre-decided by nature? Something to think  about

"I've Been Watching Your Videos Science 2023 but This Video Isn't As usual. I think You just Go with the flow That the Present Modern society are going throw. 

So For example I'm giving you a situation suppose In A protest Men And Women Take part and Police charge on the protest. They Beat Both Genders Then why Give more sympathy To women. Isn't Men are Deprived off? 

I think In the name of feminism They Are Trying To convert the Society Female Based. 
I Am Aware Of These Women Rights  But Now Days Divorce Rate is Increasing Alarmingly And on of the biggest Reason Is Husband and wife are not giving Much time to them. I Don't say Women Should not go to office,the fact is men and women's Don't think in the same way. They Do Job Till 7 Pm Came back From Office They don't interact And There comes The possibility of being Possessive And You Know Women are more possessive Than man, you agree or not.
I know Without Educating women a nation can shine. But in The Name of Feminism What they are doing is totally Fault. Women and men can't be equal women can't do Those work that Man can. So Equality Is Not suitable here. What we can do that if men became possessive Then Women have the right to take against Him."

Hope this video reaches every audience so that they can look at the right path..

You are doing an amazing job"

"This video needs to be watched by each and every youth.. 
This is the best explanation of those controversial words (patriarchy and feminism).
You are opening the eyes of every people.. Love u for that♥"
"Hi Druv, by any chance can I get this in English or in Deutsch?"
Bro come and live in India and get to know about the current emotional stress in the society and its complexity at the root level...... Things are not so easy to be implied.Reality is different... We also see girls using boys to pass thier time and use them for their economic benefit... When they are done they change the person like nothing happened or blame the boy for the emotional stress... We need to understand the moral values and mutual respect rather than pointing only one gender... Building trust and compassion can lead us to a better society since both men and women have both good and bad in them........ THANK YOU FOR READING 🙏

"Thanks , Dhruv for making balanced video. 
In Maharashtra there have been large number of social activists who awakened the people before the word Feminism came in the use. Mahatma Phule, Savitribai Phule, Agarkar, Maharshi Karve and so on. 
But from 70s Dr. Vidya Bal has published her views about feminism in her magazine Miloon saryajani. She has emphasized that we are not against men but we want men and women to work together for enrichment of their life. Thankfully that time Maharashtra government was of progressive  thoughts and arranged for subsidies for this magazine. They have helped large number of women from different strata of the society."
"in reality the feminism you are describing has been dissolved by those who are using this as a shield to justify their bad actions, there are very few people who we can really say that they really are a feminist most of the people just use it as their convenience."
Bhai accha scam kar lete ho profile million views likhkar 😂😂
I’ll never consider both gender equal untill the laws favouring woman gets off!
Fact
What a educational video and it even exposes the problems and the causes for it in our society
Is BJP feminist? 😂😂🤣🤣
"4:29 Dear Dhruv love your content in general but you example where the lady says is it necessary for women to get out of home felt a little off. Offering a choice vs forcing people are two entirely different things. I think forcing women or even men to be a particular way be it in the name of feminism or patriarchy is bad. Earlier it used to happen as patriarchy now even the extremely vocal feminists have started to push/force women in the name of their cause to conform to a particular role. I wish we had a neutral term which we could be associated with, one where every human were free to be the way they wanted."
Make a video on feminism in islam
Salman rashdi malaon Allah pak usko jahnam me azab de.
"Yes all the points mentioned in the video are correct, but you have failed to acknowledge one major issue which has become mainstream in all forms of media, which is pandering to toxic feminism, be it movies, tv shows, even stand up events, women are just being portrayed as superior to men, then there constant humiliation of men showing them as stupid, voilent or just incompetent creeps, feminism is about gender equality but in todays world it's just becoming an excuse for female entitlement."
"Dhruv rathee major videos mei sirf Hindu ko hi target krte hai, jese ki femenist ke iss video pe hinduism ke kch words ko nikala gaya hai... Dhruv rathee majorly hinduism ke beliefs ko hi challenege krte hai..aur kyu na kre unke so called ""liberals"" aur ""mullas"" naraj ho jayenge na"

Thank you sir
Thanks 🎉
thank u druv.....u prove that the power of youth voice is inescapable
13:20 😂
Love you
"Hmm, I agree with you. But you forgot to make something clear there are two types of feminists: feminist and toxic feminist.
Although bad people exist everywhere in every community, race and gender.

The only thing is that our younger generations are thinking that these fake feminist movies represent true feminism and this problem also exist with younger males, they tend to get the wrong idea about masculinity because they follow some trash influencer (I am sure, I don't need to specify who).

And this problem is very serious in western countries, so it should be no surprise that one day our country's population will try to copy the western culture just like we always have."
"The main problem of patriarchy is it  attracts women 
Women force men to do so"
Bro got brainwashed by his wife Ig 😂
"it is for both men and women to choose to be whatever they want, it's just thinking of the person that makes them good or bad in public eyes, ""kuch to log kahenge logo ka kaam hai kehna"" (they too have their own mind to think however they want)."
"Humanism ✅️ 
No feminism"
It would had been better if u had shown how that movie (thumbnail) misleads the youth like u did it in animal movie . Well good strategy to win feminine votes
Can’t express my gratitude w words Dhruv sir. I feel blessed to have the exact same mindset as yours.
Baccha tu apna Gyan apna pasa rakh.... Mai tujhe sa jadda janta hu
Calling feminism is all about equality is like calling RSS  a secular organisation 😅

"We understand that feminism is good.  Feminism is about equality.  I have some questions
  1. Feminism: If there are men right involve, why does it start with Fem and not Men?  It's just brainwashing that feminism is always about women, not men!
  2. If so-called alpha males show people the false presence of feminism, what about alpha women who have tried to show more superiority than men?.
  3. So can you give us a term that has been proven to be Alpha Feminism and has an advantage like Neha Dhupia “it is her choice” if it is not feminism then what do we call it?  extremist feminism 🤣
  4. You talked about women's faminism.  Why don't you tell us something about men and show the world that there are women right involve too?

"a lot of creators bash feminism for clickbait and views, but i appreciate you doing an actual critical analysis of the topic, and clearing up false information about feminism."
"I have a Question pls reply everybody,,Is Dowry Wrong or right according to new Generation????And if it is wrong then explain why???"
"In the Quran, I’ve not found places where Allah specifically commands the domination of men over women. On the contrary, the Quran revealed over 1400 years ago, confirms the spiritual equality of women and men, gives women the right to inherit, to own property (and not to be considered property), to seek a livelihood, to marry only by their consent, to divorce and keep their children, and to be educated—rights that were won by Western women only in the last century. Verses in the Quran that suggest patriarchal arrangements are in response to specific historical circumstances only.
Allah has resolved this debate if Islam is followed in true letter and spirit.
The equality of men and women is wrong to debate the right debate is true justice among both.

"awesome video but do not only take example of vishv hindu parishad and taking example against feminism from sanatan culturre . Explore other religion also , wearing hijab and women not allowed in majids must be added in your videos"
Why there is even a debate on men and women....God made both for a purpose and we should try to obey that .....i am not against women or anything i am just saying this is pathetic to compare both of the two .....
"""chhapri gang"" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
ye banda kitna positive h❤❤❤❤
You explained the Problem but did not gave a roadplan or a solution that we can adopt in our everyday life
"Its a great video but still incomplete, you didn't talk properly about pseudo feminism and how it is much much more harmful than patriarchy. You will find that the cases like Neha Dupia, that girl slapping the boy and movies like four more shots are increasing the society in the name of pseudo feminism, if at other end there are chapri males then there are chapri females as well, who really think that smoking, drinking and having casual sex is women empowerment. Check US what the situation is there, divorce rates are at all time high. Also yes the females can never be equal to males, because the physical strength and mental strength is different. They are ""feminine"" and men are ""masculine"". In army as well, women are not allowed to participate in actual combats, and the other side is males are weak in terms of emotional strength, a mother can still give complete parenting to a child but a father alone can't.

That's why I feel the fight should be not about changing the roles but it should be about equal opportunities"

"10:10  When you talked about a man in a wheelchair, society gives them (person on wheelchair)  priority not equality. Same goes for women, we need to give them priority not equality. there will be no valid argument about this but the truth is our sister, mother, wife are our treasure we need to give them priority over everything... Equality Doesn't fit with their physical attribute they can't bear the same job as men. Irony is, this capitalist society Doesn't allow this doctrine,  they use our women as product."
Listening your words are like listening my own self. Your words means a lot in my life.
"Someway or the other , Mr Rathi is always able to show half truth and make it sound like the  whole truth.
Everyone knows his ideology is leftist, If anyone is watching his videos to educate himself/herself/themselves++, he/she/they++ should watch videos on other side of the spectrum too to get a full picture and then decide , coz Mr Rathi always show half baked half truth.

See both sides of the spectrum and then decide what suits your idea ."
Left Wing Propaganda..............FreshandFit Podcast is the Antidote to this half truth/information.........
These men who hates feminism even after knowing its for the good of everyone they just want to stay previlaged as they were before and dont want to come down to a status of equality. They will never leave the advantages that they get from the system. A good man will never want these type of advantages. We all want to live in a world that is safe for everyone.

"Perfect timing! Now I can relate this video to ""Trees"" poem for the board exam"
"Why our teacher discriminate against boys why our parents protect their girl child more than their sun ?
Why most of the hardest jobs are done by mens like cleaning, sweepers, ???
When mens work they feed their family
But women invest in themselves this is difference!!!
And you said that feminism is for equality between mens and womens
So why feminist always demand for womens wright???"
"Men and women are equal . We find good and bad in both , high IQ and low IQ s in both.
 only because women gave birth it cannot bring such a huge difference between men and women."
"I agree with the mindset showcased in video. But I have a problem with the word feminism. If feminism is equality, then we should run a campaign for meninism. If you want equality and equal rights, we should focus on the word equality. What I am saying is that we should not create more sub divisions and words that create more identity politics. Focus can be on equality. It doesnt require an outside agency to attain equality and equal rights. Feminism in some quarters ofcourse will and has become an ideology which it is, and it diminishes it credibility. But equal rights in itself is absolute"
Brilliant Dhruv!! Society needs people like you to teach the mass. You are simply amazing.
"This is all nonsense. Men should always maintain control over their emotions; no man genuinely desires to cry, and if they do, they should strive to control themselves. Men who display such high levels of emotion, including crying, are often associated with school shootings and domestic violence. Throughout his video, he repeatedly emphasizes that society tells girls that they are being judged. However, it's not solely society; girls desire certain attributes in men across the world, regardless of whether they identify as liberal or conservative. Men and women are inherently different, living by distinct rules shaped by patriarchy, which has taken us from the jungle to the moon. I suppose it's not all bad. These ideas might seem plausible on paper, but in the harsh reality of the world, which these liberal morons have no understanding of, they simply do not work. As a man, if you embrace feminism or weakness, as he suggests in the video, the majority of liberal feminist women would never consider you a potential partner."
"Tum jis vampanth aur western society me rhte ho Dhruv, usme Aisa hi hota h sahi kaha tumne, aur usi me feminism ka jarurat bhi h. Tumhare wo bhai jiske baap 'West' h aur Jo tumhari trh leftists mansikta se grasit h unhe for sure feminism ki gutti jarurui h. Bimari jis vichardhara se aayi ho, ilaz bhi usi vichardhara ka jaruri hai. 

Hm ""yashya nariyestu pujyante ramante tantra devta"" jaisi sanskriti se, Sanatan Dharma se aate h."
"I'd say I didn't like this one, I'm actually a feminist but the fact you spoke 95 to 98% good facts with a mixture of 2-5% propaganda makes it a bad video. (PS: I'm a subscriber and also, I'm not an Andh-bhakt😅) I know just like Andh-bhakts there is a catagory which will defend this video."

"He adds too many opinions with facts. Then he has the right too. We live in a world where a lot is going wrong. Then as a Man you need to be strong. If you dont want to, its upto you. Men and women are unique and equally important in their own rights. But no man would step back or send her woman ahead when trouble comes."
Equal hone ka ye matlab thodi na hai ki body match kare ye to adhikaro ke bare me hai jab father gujar jate hai aur mother akeli ho jati hai to kya wah mother bas jhadu pochha karengi ki apni degree ya apni ability ke adhar par kam karengi
Neha Dhoopia is a joke
Outstanding Knowledge Dear Dhruv.. Thnq So Much for Sharing with us always
Forget about hard words just one thing to ask is there any special code in our constitution for men?? But I know there are several women. Please clarify this if you have time.. BTW thank you for this informative video.

Goodbye from now because you are a foolish person giving meaningless examples and evidences fak off"
Chapri gang 😂
Yes you are right bro Animal movie is a cancer 😅
"Educational video, but please don't use word chapri that often. It's reducing the severity of the issue."
interesting how some so called woke women are the ones jumping between patriarchy and feminism whenever they feel whats good for **them** at that situation.
"As a human men are still struggling to get basic human rights and protection from constitution
Such as 
1. Sexual harrasment laws should be gender neutral
2. If a boy watches or capture half naked or naked images of girl will get 7 years jail but if girl does same with boy then no punishment
3. If a boy disrobe any girl he will get at least 7 year jail but if girl does same thing to boy then no punishment
4.If a girl make promise to marry and had relation with boy & at the time of marriage deny to marry him no punishment for her but if boy did same he will face rape charges, 10 years of jail and only on girls statement immediately arrest
5. If a wife had sexual relation with man other than her husband then no punishment for her instead if on this ground if husband ask divorce he has to pay alimony (only if she is in live in relationship with her boyfriends during marriage then alimony can avoided)if man does the same he can land in jail in 498a due to mental cruelty cause by his affairs to his wife and need to pay alimony to her.
5.if you live with your wife but didn't had sex. And wife gets pregnant by other man still its your responsibility to pay for child.
6.If wife does physical or mental cruelty to husband he can only divorce but still has yo pay alimony to her. If husband does same wife can complaint 498a on entire family can arrest. And gets the alimony.
7. If any girl accused you for rape only on her statement you can arrested and if case turn out to false no punishment for her (in some cases court applies nominal fine)
8. Stalking is offence only punishment for boys 
9. Verbal abuse , physical abuse , emotional abuse, econmical abuse , mental abuse all this can only happens to women only and only boys can punished as per constitution

So if you consider yourself a Faminist, equal Rights supporter then why you vant support equal rights for men also"

Sorry to say but this video is poorly researched!
"Okay please tell me WHEN TF WILL WOMEN BE EQUAL TO MEN???
HOW TF DID YOU MAKE A FALSE STATEMENT ABOUT WOMEN STILL NOT BEING ON EQUAL GROUND AS MEN??
Men and women are equal, I would go as far to women have much power over men due to indian laws,
You White knighted all Men's right issues, didn't expect this from you, 
I thought you were not a coward, but you are just another bigger sheep in the herd"

"Thank you very much for making video in this topic. It will really help many girls and boys who are suffering from this patriarchy society. Keep raising your voice  @dhruv_rathi  against on such issues which is really a basic root of problem in our India.
I'm really really happy that you made video on this topic. I'll share it as much as I can❤"

"Thank you sooo much dhruv Rathee..you changed my perception towards feminism..I appreciate your efforts, Cause of your informative video I'm gonna study on this subjects deeply and I'm sure that it'll give me another clear vision to see the world as it is,not how they show in movies or social media apps.

"I was attracted to your video because of key word ""Indian"" in your video title. @dhruvrathee very interesting take on men's rights. May I request you to highlight what rights does men have that women in India do not have?  could not think of any.  If your team does a thorough job they would find that the list of rights of women in India would be longer and if that should be the case then feminisms should not exist if it was just about equal rights - read second wave feminist Betty Friedan opinion on chauvinism. Also 22:00 ""thappad"" kindly give more mature example - and kindly Cite one divorce judgement granted to husband mere based on a ""thappad"". . . your research seems influenced by ideology of west. . . in ancient India women had right to vote , right to choose partner . . .centuries before so called first wave in west. . . - You got 14m subscribers and this video had about 4m views by the time I wrote the comment. . .  request you be more responsible on your narrative and research  . .  as you like reading read mix authors of different regions . . . you have power to influence the ""malleable"" youth. GOOD LUCK"
Men and Women are not equal 🫸🏽
"I think 'Animal' movie mein sirf ek nhi, bohot sari psychological disorders show kiya gya hai, jisme admi ek parent ko super maan lete hai jinse wo bachpan mein ignored huya karte the. Narcissistic mentality bhi show kiya gya. Alpha male is a rule of jungle, not that of the human being. That's why the movie shows a negative name - Animal. Ek admi father se itna pyar karte huye bhi ""Animal"" kaha jata hai, because of his acts on women and his revengeful attitude. I found the film highly psychological, meaningful and educational as well."
भाई कभी कुछ इस्लाम के बारे में भी बाते बता।  इस्लाम में औरत को किस तरह का दर्जा दिया जाता है। में तो नास्तिक हूं। मगर मेरे घर के आसपास हिंदू मुस्लिम दोनो रहते हैं। मेने नोटिस किया है हिंदू घर में। औरत को देवी वाला दर्जा मिला होता है। और मुस्लिम परिवार में एक बहु हे जिसको घर के सारे मर्द नोच रहे हैं। 😢😢😢 कभी उनके लिए भी बोल भाई।

"We need to understand that drinking, smoking aren't about women or ken empowerment... But about equality... about equali right to choose or making informed choice by a full grown adult...and aby gender making that choice should be respected and perceived in same way... Not men as just humsms drinking and smoking or having sex .but women doing these are labelled... or looked upon as easy..

Even being easy is one's own autonomy and choice...that should be respected... We don't call men easy but men are much easily available than women in reality... We don't label them... When those labels actually eull suit men wayyy more... 

Amd YES SEXUAL FREEDOM IS FENIMISM.... EQUAL SEXUAL AUTONOMY AND RIGHTS FOR ALL GENDERS WITHOUT SOCIAL STIGMA, JUDGMENT AND DOUBLE STANDARDS AGAINST WOMEN THAT WOMEN ALWAYS FACE .. THAT IS VERY MUCH FEMINISM.. PINK MOVIE IS ALL ABOUT CONSENT, SEXUAL FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF WOMEN AS MUCH AS MEN...ITS ABOUT SHATTERING THE SEXUAL DOUBLE STANDARDS AGAINST WOMEN. SEXUAL DOUBLE STANDARDS AGAINST WOMEN IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST PILLERS OF PATRIARCHAL POWER DYNAMICS... LIKE COMMUNITY D**KS CLAIMING ""NO SEAL NO DEAL""... THEY NEED SERIOUS SEX EDUCATION THAT THERE IS NO SEAL TO EVEN BEGIN WITH..."
"salman rushdi and ""legendary author"" lmao 😂😂😂
dhruv please pull your ostrich head outside of ground there is whole another world beyond your thinking"
men and women are never gonna be equal on all grounds. and men will be always higher on the external matter and in family matter women hold much strong position.
u need to know that there is a difference between femanism and toxic femenism
"Mens rights activism, manosphere, incel, redpill groups are the biggest resoan behind destruction of the society, increasing violence against women, toxic masculinity, mens loneliness... And femimism is fighting back all these demons .. thats why femimism is under so much attack .. yes... many men purpisely don't want equality of any kind..."
"13:09 what the HELLLL broo, i ALWAISS saii thiss , Class 1 mein we read it ""Maine SwikaR nahi kiya"" when Lord saiis it to UngliMaaLL 😭😭"
"Objectification is always wrong... So is cheating... But males are hardly objectified as much by women as much as the the vice versa... Men even don't feel ashamed to objectify lesbian women who don't give a damn about men ... 

And definitely smoking and drinking are informed choices of adult people... So is sexual freedom... Agar mard smoke or drink kar sakte hain koi nehi bolta ki yeh fake mens rights activism hain? Thrn why when women drink and smoke, these same men call it fake feminism? Whats the motive behind calling women's equal right to choose as ""fake feminism""??? Do they eben understand femimism? Ir trying to define it as per theor hypocritical biases??? Men kyo. Ja kar Sharab peete hain aur smoke karte hain? If those are normal tor them them thide are equally normal are respectable for women too... And yes... This is feminism... Those who deny this vasic equality of choice are the biggest fake men's rights activists and fake feminists... Feminism and equal rights can't be ""adhi adhuri""... Thats pseudo feminism... Which most men practice. 
Men should be allies to feminism... What what these men do instead is to try to mansplan what femimism should be according to men's convenience..."

We’re lucky to have guys like Dhruv to enlighten all of us
agree with vid but why you dont criticize the equality in our judiciary for men like fake cases alimony maintenance charge should be paid by men even if women is employed and men is unemployed what about the cases when men caught women cheating and in opposite women do case to men  and men goes jail please also address the blind feminism following that 'women is innocent until proven wrong  and men is wrong until proven innocent'
The idea of feminism is cool until it converts into toxic feminism.
I learn lot of things from this content. Thank Mr. Dhruv Rathee for this content. ❤❤❤
"DEAR ALL FEMINIST JUST TELL ME ONE RIGHT THAT INDIAN MEN HAVE AND WOMEN DON'T HAVE, ( THERE ARE DOZENS THAT MEN DON'T HAVE BTW )"
Lol. Men and woman have different roles therefore they can never truly be equal. faminism is a cancer
Men and women are both equal. They both are made of sperm. So no physical discrimination. But islam made men more dominant. In daily life. Allah made  men stronger. He is in charge of house. If a woman do not obey his husband than she is doing sin... Muslims didn't know islanic teachings. Thats why they get astry and trapped by secularism
He's himself confused
No muslim should support feminism. Islam. Clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of ideal woman. Dhruv didn't knew about our religion. So do not blindly accept his secular views. Read sura nisa .All your doubts will be cleared. Yes their is code of conduct for Muslim men too. But feminism is more toxic then patriarchy.
Me nahi hu feminism k haq me
"My question is, why equal right to  drinking, smoking and sexual freedom can't be feminist issues??? Of you consider these as men's domain then you are not a feminist first of all .. if you think ok... At least a few things like drinking, smoking one night stands should be men's domain .. women should not do these ""in the name of feminism "" you deny women right to full sexual freedom then you are a fake feminist yourself...why women can't have equal rights and equal respect in exercising these right as much as men??? Yes these are feminist issues... Women choosing to drink or smoke or having multiple sexual partners as  full grown adults is feminism... 

Why a man is a drunk person but a woman drinking is a loose character?  Why a man is a stud but women is a s**t??? Is that feminism for you? 

My question is simple... when men drink, smoke, have one night stands...hire sex workers ..these men don't call out it as *fake men's rights activism* then if a woman do all of these, why they call it ""fake feminism*??? What's the logic? Actually these people are themselves fake men's rights activists... And biggest hypocrites..."
ek aisa samaj jisme sofia ansari anjali arora jaisi females h ...jinhe social media star bna diya jata hai jo feminism k nam pr kuch bhi kr rhi hai plz ek video un pr bhi bnaye jisje atleast hmare young gen ko smjh me aaye kin logo ko apna ideal bnana chahiye aur kinse aspire hona chahiye
I don't have problem with feminism. But the major problem arises when a female supports both Feminism and Patriarchy depending upon her benefits😞
"there should be equality of opportunity in any rational and just society, but equality of outcome is not possible.
there will always be a disparity, like you can see even in developed countries. it is my opinion that forcing absolute
equality is foolish."
"Bhai feminism word ka asli Matlab hi nahi pata apne logo ko, isliye ye word ki orr itni negativity hai."
Indian society me female ke liye equal rights 25% Indian constitution me female ke liye rights 100% men have 0%

"Good Education is the most important thing to clear this toxic mindset 

The first feminist i ever knew was my father

When my sister wnted to prep for neet and study in kota i saw this what will she do by studying thing in own my family 
You see these things on tv and just think its drama but no at some level it is reality
My Grandfather and grandmother were strictly against it 
After she failed her first attempt every one like we told you waste of money
Even my mom was against it for sending her 2nd time
I remember it as clear first time 
My dad and sister were talking and i was on my phone next to them
He was like if you wanna go and prep another year we'll go next week 

But i guess my sister got under pressure from like every body in family and eventually didn't go 

But she did cleared NET last year and is completing phd from DU 
My Dad now sometimes teases her you wanted to  be a doctor so bad then huhh😅

But when i was 11th grade my grandfather was like you should go to kota"

"अगर आदमी ऑर औरत same है, तो Divorce के बाद legally पत्नी पती से पैसे क्यो लेती है 

अगर कोई Female रेप कर दे कोई male का, तो उसे legally सजा क्यो नही होती.

अगर कोई male ऑर female का झगडा हो जाये, ऑर female रो पडी, तो सारे लोग male को ही क्यू blame करते है.

क्या मर्दो के साथ भी बोहोत सारी चीजे गलत नही होती."

"2;00-3;00, feminism has become a cancer because what it practically does and pushes and believes is mutating as time goes on. This is much beyond the original definition. This video is blaming everything on 'patriarchy' without understanding the profound impact of biology and hormones on men. Dhruv this is one of your dumbest videos. I am so sorry."
Perfectly summarised 🎉

"People will only listen to the part of story that they want to listen and what is convenient to them. When I wanted to study, a lot of my relatives started giving examples of how educated girls can't find a suitable groom, they can't be a good wife, she will start smoking and drinking and make boyfriends. She won't be in control. But no such thing happened. 
Some people don't want women to get educated so they will give all the illogical reason to portray an educated woman as evil. Same happens with feminism as well. Some people don't want to give woman equal rights so they will start giving reasons on how feminism is bad. Whenever a woman does something wrong, feminism is blamed even when the woman is not even a feminist. Whenever something bad happens with a man feminism is blamed. Feminism is about giving equal rights to woman. It does not say that men are evil and woman are perfect but even if a woman is not perfect and makes mistakes, she still deserves equal rights and opportunities like how men get. 
All these reels that protray men's problem don't actually want to help men, they just want to justify men's shitty behaviour. Consider jyoti mourya case also, the man was victim there but there were very few posts that sympathise with him. Most posts were like ladki ko padhaoge to yahi hoga, ladki par bharosa karoge to yahi hoga. They just wanted to justify why men are right when they don't let women in their family study. The same men will support patriarchy and then cry about men's problem."

It's same for Pakistan also! Not for only India
"1st I agree in 85-90% of things dhruv rathe sir said but i have question what are the rules which support men(not minor) in India rather than this Article 14-18 of the Constitution
This article ensures that men cannot be discriminated against based on caste, status, wealth, religion, and race. Sir i want know what are other benefits for men in society 🤔 
Now reverse the benefits for women in society ? There is new laws daily been made in favor of women, why? 
Now coming back to ur video now what do u tell for men?? 
Not to protect women?
They are equal and they have strength to protect themselves??
In that case why Kings safe guarded their places and wife by conquering??
This is my opinion still more to learn✌️"

It means people was confused between feminism and matriarchy
Then feminists should also fight and compete males in any competition if not we are not getting equal rights then or they have more benefits over males 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Batter luck next time bro you totally support

"I don't think it's right to blame people for telling you why you don't review movies which spread toxic feminism, this ask isn't patriarchy. I understand those movies don't define feminism but they spread the wrong message.
Instead of calling out people who asked you to review those movies if you had reviewed those movies and told everyone ""this is wrong"", I feel, it would have been better.

You, very conveniently, said that feminists don't support those movies or the hypocrisy of Neha dhupia and hence people showing that as fake feminism is wrong, but the truth is some fake feminists do use them and they equally bad as those chapris you called out. It would have been really good to see you call out those fake feminists too."
Great video ❤
This is 100 percent true that dhruv rathee said I am a boy and have faced many lonely and stress problems because my family supports patriarchy an after this video my father also started supporting feminism.tx dhruv sir for this.
Totally in love with your videos❤

"But everywhere I see I see only the toxic feminism, I never saw feminism that Dhruv explained. Every girl I met wants men supirior to them in every way. If she is a PhD holder she wants a man more than that. she doesn't care about other less educated people even if they are graduated. They don't want men who gets less paid than them. They don't want men who are shorter than them. Why? I feel this will never change. The real feminism is never gonna happen. Untill it's nomenclature is changed from feminism to other word. Because everyone are thinking that feminism is something accociated with females due to its wording. Everyone is believing that if females don't accept the following things that I above mentioned( about marriage preferences) then when will men support women? I strongly believe in Feminism that Dhruv explained even before I know that it was feminism. But after I heard the word Feminism my mind totally changed that what I believe was different from feminism that everyone are portraying. Some people are even following different feminism which gonna impact on the society in the future. As far as this goes I am gonna stick to my beliefs and values and not gonna name that as feminism or any other thing. Because I wanna normalise it (feminism) without the word feminism. I really feel the word is distracting the actual goal of this"

"You didn't even called out what bullshit feminists throw at men when men express their problems. Patriarchy theory only looks at sexism from a female standpoint and I find that most feminists are 90% unaware of the different kinds of sexism against men or even claim that there is no such thing as sexism against men because men are privileged (talk about circular reasoning).
There is also the notion that sexism against men is only a side effect of patriarchy against women. This again conveys the female-centric view of feminism, because you could just as well say that sexism against women is just a side effect from sexism against men and that would be just as valid.
What we have is a society full of sexism that strikes both ways. Most sexist norms affect both men and women but in completely different ways. Why would we call such a society a ""patriarchy"" ?
 Biological differences led to different expectations for men and women, and these expectations have over time not only been cemented but also fleshed out into more and more norms, based on the consequences of the first norms. Many thousands of years later it has become quite the monster with a life of its own, dictating what is expected of men and women today. Again, why would you call this patriarchy or matriarchy instead of just plain ""sexism""?
If you concede that men having positions of power is not the source of sexism, then why name your sexism-related worldview after that fact? It is then just another aspect of sexism like any other, or even a natural result of the fact that men are biologically geared for more risky behavior. For example,  the vast majority of homeless people are men. Why is this not a problem to anyone (answer: male disposability)? Why is feminism only focusing on one half of the equation and conveniently forgetting the other half. Men exist in abundance in the top and the bottom of society. Why? 
So to sum it up. Patriarchy is a terrible name for sexism since sexism affects both genders and is not born of male power. Male power is a tiny part of the entirety of sexism and hardly worth naming it after.

That's patriarchy. I am also kind of baffled that you think the solution to mens problems is feminism. Because feminism has such a good track record for solving mens issues right? The fact is that feminism is a major force fighting against mens rights. Both politically, in terms of promotion of new laws and such (promise of marriage is rape, marital rape which is again not gender neutral etc.), this proves that they just want to extort men and treat them as ATM's, and socially, in the way feminists spew hatred upon the mens rights movement and take any chance to disrupt it. As well as the fact that a vast majority of the feminists I've met (and I've met many, both irl and online) have a firm belief that there is no such thing as sexism against men!
You seriously want us to go to these people for help with our issues?"

So if feminism means equal opportunities between males and females... then why is it not called equalism and not feminism????

Thats a very good video but one thing that many girls i have seen who says that we dont need men and many girls also supports all this shit so we dont criticise the real feminist but those who say all this shit i mean atleast i dont do so
"I watched the complete video, and I strongly understand and appreciate all the points that Dhruv bhaiya kept. But I really have a genuine question, I often have heard form my mother, birth of a girl is not good because after their marriage, she'll move to her husband's house or like that. For which the parents of the daughter will have to live alone during their old ages. So, is it a patriarchal thinking? Additionally, when i said to my mom, that if father and mother of both sides will live together with their son and daughter, then it would be good, but she said that would be a shame in the society if the man will not allow them to stay or like that. I really think about this 🤔"
"कुछ दिन में ध्रुव भाई बोलेंगे की "" लड़कियों और लडको को अपना parivet part ढकना ही नहीं चाहिए। क्युकी भगवान का बनाया हुआ तो पूरा शरीर है फिर चेहरे को नही ढकते हो और प्राइवेट पार्ट को क्यों ढक रहे हो। ये तो नाइंसाफी है।😂"

While feminism is fine and all the real issue here is that  men are being left out kinda coz we also suffer from stereotypes.... there is also the fact that there is no national men commission ....
Thank You For Giving me Clarity 😊
First time i saw dhruv was thinking emotionally 😊
"10:57 i have to disagree with that point. These feminists have made the laws such that they can Target and destroy a innocent man's. Ex- fake rape,dowry. No men's rights,no men's protection laws. You can't sue a women for stalking you or slapping you but she can. This is feminism."
Nice
Good topic 👍
"So why won't this name feminism be changed,so that many people would relate to get equal rights. Because till now the definition of feminism was totally different for us . This name ""feminism"" and it's definition do not match clearly. So people get confused. And don't women accept a house husband?And why should men do all physical work like workers."

"Gender equality is incomplete without legal reform. A man is legally bound to maintain his wife even if he is unemployed while its not the case for wife even if she is working. 
As usual a gender bias is there in your words. You wouldn't use the words like chhapri for women."
"This was the trashiest oversimplification  from druv rathe to spread delusion😃..... Your features define your position in natural heirarchy which shapes the society. And those define your right. Imagine giving argument like; there is only difference of two to three organs between man and women. 🤣🤣... Dude needs understand that whole stories rely on these few organs and features.. Pregnency is not just some random feature that you can include in the list and get over. It brings a whole different story and compulsions in life of women😃..its sets their life on a whole different path with different restrictions... The difference of penus and vagina isnt  just about their shapes.. There is a whole psychological difference between man and women.. 😂😂.. Like man have more sexual drive that can often be lust. While women cannot operate on lust. Thats why you dont see a prostitution place in the world where man are available in stocks and women pay to have sex with them. This symetry ultimately shapes our dating marketplace, which results in man and women looking for different things in each other. I can go on for days adding to this list, explainig the points of distinction between man and women and how they ultimately create a chaotic difference at societal scale. There is a whole world behind each and every organ and features where man women are different. Each of these decides an enritely different path for our life.. 
  But my bro just acted blind😃 and oversimplified everything to sell his trash... But what we expect? Fallacies and oversimplification is what feminism is all about 😁😁"

"If no feminist come in the support of a women doing wrong to men but they even did not talk against them, being sclient is being in support, no feminist talked against the women who did all the wrong to our Cricketer Mohammad Shami, this videos is a shame for pleasing women, if you are real feminist then talk about both the sides, talk about how many false cases women file against men to extort money, but they will not talk about it because thats how they will not be able to please women audiance"

"When we talk about equal right  do we also talk about equal responsibility? No, responsibility is for men but rights are for women, equality in real life can only be achieved when rights and responsibilities both are equally divided, there is a term called not working women but there is no term called not working men, is this the feminism"
"I'm stopping the video at 9:40 because I'm not interested in watching the rest. Personally, I support the idea of proper rights rather than absolute equality. It's amusing to me that both men and women advocate for equal rights. From my perspective, women hold a superior position to men, so naturally, I prefer they don't enter fields like politics or other jobs where they may face unwanted attention from men. My priority is ensuring the safety of my mother, sister, wife, and daughter, protecting them from any harm. However, the push for equal rights has, in my opinion, led to negative consequences.

The feminism prevalent in our society today is concerning because some men exploit it to fulfill their perverse desires. Unfortunately, many women fail to recognize this due to the modern feminist movement advocating for equal rights. In the guise of equality, women often find themselves disrespected and marginalized in various aspects of society. On the other hand, some men take advantage of my viewpoint, denying women the respect and care they deserve. This highlights the dark side of patriarchy, where women are subjected to unnecessary violence instead of being treated with love and affection.

In summary, I believe women should be highly respected individuals in society, but I also wish to shield them from the darker aspects of society."
"Sorry it's so wrong, what about women taking advantage of faminism, this is all one sided story, I agree for women empowerment but not for taking advantage of being female, in this world where dowry is illigle but alimony is legal"
It's better to be patriarchal rather than a feminist.

Feminism is a act which fight against violence done on females and also help females to go up in society. see feminism is made for females to get equal rights because in past females where not allowed to earn study and even say anything they treated worse than slaves basically a female was only kept alive because of her beauty and ability to give birth many girls were killed before or after there birth because they are considered an taboo is the society after this some females decided to fight against this and started some movements for ex feminism etc and even after this some people are misusing feminism and eventually crushing females I am not saying men are bad i am saying this thinking is bad this society was made only in favour of men and there problems that is why there is no act like feminism for men. My opinion
You are right man❤❤. Thanks for the video 📸. Best go ahead 🎉.

My friends those are chain smoker they often told me why being a man u don't smoke? they make fun of this issues. they thought smoking cigarettes is the only way to show masculinity and manliness. i never cared about this.

"Are we really talking about equal rights? So you are just saying that , by sitting in an AC room making statements about the patriachy system , have you ever wondered on what term feminists ask for rights? Do they want to protect our nation from neighbouring countries by holding a gun ? Or ever they protested about clashing in upcoming battles with opposition countries? No they just want equal opportunities in big companies where they can enjoy the luxury like men so? We gave them, they are enjoying it! ,In almost every sector they got reservation, dont you see? Have you ever heard the news that a women officer or soldier died during the duty? All the works which are risky will be done by men , and the so called feminists will not ask for the equal , work ,they ask for perks ,powers, nobody wants to get dirty and stinky in their own sweat , i never saw womens are deputed to hold the riots back and sacrificing their lives , all those pity goes to your patriachal men , but i have seen many women getting Commissioned to ips or ias, 😂😂😂 Why they just dont protest for the responsibilities already. 😊😊 Protest for the responsibilty not just perks"

"Equal rights should be given based on both genders physical strength/ability, mental strength/ability. suppose, normally a common woman can not fight with a common  man unless she is professional fighter. we have accept that fact that we are different, even prime minister rishi sunak also said it courageously in front of many british people."

I am from pakistan I came to your channel for the first time. I agree with your thoughts Feminism should not be completely stopped but  because women do have rights ans that should be given to them even each religion has specified there rights whther it education respect or something else and brother when you study Islam you would find that it has given more protection and rights to women than men but the problem is that all those people who participate in women march or when most of the people talk about feminism they would try to separate the women from the men and that is i think the blunder God has created them for eàch other and both are depndent on each other but movies and media always try to make the point that girls can leave for ever and they dont need a man bcz all that a girls needs is money if she is making money she is indepndent that ideology is devastating and that is not feminsm

i realy admire dhru rati but i dont agree with him saying that as a man you can be weak and can cry''  no mother wants a weak child no women wants a weak husband no sister wants a weak brother ''as a man you have to be strong to be benficial  to your society and to your family masculinity in mens does not mean you have to be against females it means you have  to be strong and in total controol of yourself

Remember the dialogue of ranvijay when he talk about Alfa male & poetry ...... It's feel like wo ache ladko ko chu7ya bol raha hai ...
In a Dirty place like Social Media. People like you are blessing Dhruv. Keep going bro.
ab LGBTQ+ pe video bana
"Dhruv sir there are many matters which requires the  involvement patriarchal society and on the other hand feminism has its own importance 
But the society cant move on with a one declaration of patriarchy or feminism different matters requires different ways to be sought out 
Like the one you talked that mens cant cry, this too affects as an important role in the protection of family as man is the protector of family and seeing the protector cry would definitely led to a negative impact on the self confidence  of a family

"I hope whoever liked this video has voting for equality for both  and same thought process to be kept for both genders....and have new improved thoughts over this feminism. Only our thought process can change our surroundings,our living, and the world...then crime won't happen..I hope the world soon change their Own thought"
I had loved your videos but now It seems like your words aren't yours anymore
Men and women are not literally equal tho! People need to understand that! They're naturally different in their own ways! Women often think they can do anything a man can!
schools and college should show dhruv ratheee informative vedios .... I wish i wish... His informative vedios spread through whole world... But i don't think it would ever happen bcz of illiteracy 😢😢
I hope that this video reaches more and more youth who are suffering from toxic masculinity and patriarchy.
Gaurav Thakur ki video ka jabab de skate ho dhruv bhai.. Farmers protest par Jo banao hai unhone
He is very much right in his video. And I believe that it is the fault of media and so called superstars that feminism movement is misunderstood by everyone.
His subscribers are highly educated ❤
Need a video on farmer protest
Asslamu Alaikum vai🥰 ❤👍🏿👍🏿🤲🏿🤲🏿🤲🏿
So called modern backchod dhruv
Amazing explanation Brother!!!!❤
Kya ye buri buri baate only Hindu religion and scriptures me hi likhi h??? Why you never said a word about Muslim or triple talaq?????
Nice
Sir please Simson cartoon ki reality explain karin please
Please video in framer protest 2 .0
"In earlier times, feminism seemed like the right term, but in 2024, perhaps ""equalism"" sounds more appropriate. Kyunki sirf kuch charpri ladke hi nahi, kuch chapri ladkiyan bhi feminism ko matriarchy se confuse karti hain, and almost every average person associates feminism with female supremacy over men. Both genders are equal, so let's refer to it as 'equalism.'"
Aur Randwe Kya Hal Hai
Sab English mai bol rahe par mujhe sirf hindi aati isliye mai hindi may comment karungi

"Video se kafi clear hua ki, Hindu Women have more rights than other visesh samuday women but still you wont talk single word about it... Seems this video is created just to show how patriarchal and bad Hindus are... baki sab acche hai bas hum hi galat hai..."

"Patriarchy and masculine rocks

Masculine- equal rights for men in the world"
This video needs to be shared on a massive level. This is the difference between an educated conscentious influencer and a fake toxic influencers.

Bro is talking about garud puran but not a word about burka so secular
Boys don't cry !!
Too good..
Dhruv your videos are becoming less engaging these days. Introspection needed.
Bangaal par video banaao doglaaaa..
"Feminism = equality?🚫
Feminism = vulgarity ,lesbians ✅"
"Bhut hi accha video, Bhut acche se explain Kiya h"
Dhruv got personal problem with Chapri Gang😭😭🤣🤣
"Really clarified my thought on feminism. Thank you for making this video, a concept that really needed proper clarification!"
Hats off to your Dhruv for making this video! I am going to show this to my whole family and friends!
"Main app ki videos dekta tha but ye dekh kar afsoos hova .... men and women  ki nature belkul alag hai , they can'nt be equal"
Feminism ek emotional situation haye..Dhruv ke is video me aapko dikh jayega. Mard aur Aurat do alag species hi hain. Mard ko aurat r aurat ko mardon nahi bola jaskta.

"Love his research, his videos, so educational, meaningful, inspiring. One YouTuber who's not following the herd & is walking his own path doing beyond excellence! ❤❤❤"
👏👏👏
Patriarchy ✊✊✊
"Well explained video. Very informative. I want to understand if the following falls under patriarchy.

1. News: XX women and XX children are fear trapped. None cares about male deaths
2. Any tragedy: First rescue females and children
3. War: Men should definitely participate in war
4. A random girl can hug and kiss a guy and call it a prank but if it happens the other way around then one can expect consequences

Are these examples of patriarchy which is similar to what he explained that almost everyone imagines a 'guy' when it comes to unemployment? Or is there some other theory or nomenclature behind these?

PS: I'm completely against the patriarchal society with a narrow mind that women belong to household chores etc etc however, I want to understand the above"
"I think we presently have equal rights for everybody, regardless of whether they are male or female 
 Jordan Peterson makes a really great point that there are a few things that men can't do, and there are some things that women can't do. In my opinion forcing yourself to do things you are not supposed to do  is toxicity, no matter who's doing it.
Within the title Feminism, they made ""Four More Shots,"" which glorifies the toxicity which was already done mostly by men.
 Instead of raising awareness and point out its harmfulness, they decided to normalise it.
Believe me as Dhruv as time and again explained these movies/ series does have influence on the viewers. After watching content like this some will be inspired and will start embracing it with a justification in their mind that since they can do it, so why can't we 
Toxicity has always existed and will exist, it cannot be completely eliminated 
I wish our people (men and women) to be more focused and inspired from great things done men and women for humanity instead of toxicity.

 At the end of the day, it comes down to the individual and their choice 
 So choose wise and choose who you want to be"
Women men equal h. Metro m BHI ek coach men k liy BHI reserve ho jese women k liye.

Yeah feminism did start on grounds of equal rights and opportunities but it is not the same today in anyway.
Men will be men 😂
Its not about the gender its all about an individual who wants to work for their goals their dreams out from the boundary of society ❤
Men n women are created to complete eachother rather than competing eachother.

Feminism means equal right for women not hate mens. You are right dhruv sir.
U have involved good quality of human physiology concept in this video... literally this give me sense of social knowledge ❤
Before breakup I was a faminist 🙂
Great video sir
13:09 I find this example quite funny.According to feminism thought the female should come out of the car:3
Bhai PORNOGRAPHY EDICTION AND EFFECT IN LIFE ke upar video banado
Puri video dekh li par kuch samajh nahi aaya
Everything is usual but that your background very often looks inner uterus.
yep i understand the real meaning of feminism and for sure every human deserve equal rights .... but for that law which are being implimented currently in our county whether it's about relationship status and some crime cases that FIR by women will be considered without any reasons and males will be punished. it's true that many females are forced to lower their voice against these cases and for this they can't complain openly .... law is quite good but some of men which are not guilty also faces the problems.. like many laws are being passed and some females are using them for their own ....
Dhruv sir hasdev forest protest ke upper video please sir
So what is a sigma can you explain?
"i think he should live in this society in india, after he will realise what is reality"
Feminism k naam pr sirf or sirf vulgarity hai or kch nhi
Sabhi ko freedam honi chahiye❤❤
Plzzz make vids on lgbt
housewife is a job also
"One of the best videos, so far."
Nice video. Without interpreting correctly you make a habit of blaming the scripture which will spread a wrong message to the society.
Someone has to talk about this ... thankyou sir
"The video is ironic in the sense that, lots of whatabouteries. I was a feminist. But these days i dont want to use that word to represent equal rights. You know why?! Because its associated with more... Is there a word for it?!. So yeah i am no longer a feminist rather agree on equal rights."
Wah rathi ji wah... Vhp ki female speaker ki baat toh bata di... Hindu society me patriarchy chal rhi h wo bhi bta di.. Bahut accha kiya... Lekin islam me jo kattar patriarchy chal rahi h uska ek baar bhi naam nahi liya? Shah bano case ka el baar bhi zikar nahi.... Aur choti choti bacchiyon ko burqa pehnaya ja rha h uske baare me bhi baat nahi ki... Yhi doglapan h aapka

Please make a video on Thomas Sankara from Bukino Faso"
"Dhruv, thank you so much."
Mr. Rathi ये feminism feminism    का झुनझुना अपने जहाँ डालना है वहाँ डालो और society को patriarchal vs feminism  के रूप में दो भागों में तोड़ने का काम मत करो। इन शब्दों की जगह इंसानियत की बात करो। आप एक बात को detail से बताने की जगह घूम कर दूसरे point पर आ जाते हो। बस matter deliver अच्छा करते हो quality provide नही करते।

1st time I agree with you ❤.
This time I have to disagree with dhruv
To bring gender equality  Modi Govt must announce India China war fought only by females to take china occupied Ladakh back. because all past wars fought by men only

"Animal is just a fictional movie just like tiger , pathan ye sare movies pe aaj tak ek bhi sawal nahi uthe kyuki sab muslim hai isliye aur nahi bologe kyuki jina haina muslims ko kuch bhi nahi bologe par agar koi hindu ya sanatani kuch aisa kare toh bahut ghatiya aise soch ko salam ya sidhe bol sakta hun that's how islam brain wash 😂"
Second half of video is amazing 👍🫡salute to this man people need to understand this concept n views
"Feminism began, in order to uplift women towards equal rights & opportunities. Modern feminism is Matriarchy in disguise. If you say that modern feminism should be accepted by all, then that's Normative conformity"
Very well analysis and explanation ❤
I am a proud feminist.
Dear Dhruv it would be better if you just make videos on historical events like u used to do...people follow you because of that.. Nowadays you'r just forcing your own personal views on people.. What you think is not always right...So please always speak with facts and data..no one is here to listen your personal thoughts..
Aapne garud puran ko kote kiye toh kya aap islam ko nahi kar sakte the kya kya sare flaus sanatan me he hai kya agar aap apne aapko feminist bolte ho toh sare dharmo ko equally bolo sirf sanatan me he aisa nahi bola gaya hai islam me bhi bola gaya hai usse kote karo toh manu 😢 sare log sirf sanatan ko hi kyu target karte hai aur agar koi uska virodh kare toh woh ache log nahi agar aisa hai toh mai bhi hun plz its a request agar dusre dharam ko kuch nahi bol sakte toh sanatan ko bhi target karne ka hakk nahi hai aapka
"ध्रुव राठी तुम पक्षपात से भरे हुए हो, मैं तुम्हारे वीडियो regularly देखता हूं और मैंने ये पाया की तुम जितने भी सामाजिक मुद्दे उठाते हो उसके केंद्र बिंदु  में ज्यादातर hinduism और कुछ christianity ही रहते है।  कभी भी तुम्हारे चिंतन,  मनन, उदाहरण में मुस्लिम धर्म नही आता।  जितने भी सामाजिक उदाहरण देते हो उसमे सब में हिंदू महिलाए उनकी फोटो , हिंदू धर्म, और न्यूट्रल दिखने के लिए वेस्टर्न सोसायटी।   मैं ये नही कह रहा की जो तुम बोल रहे हो वो गलत है। लेकिन सबसे ज्यादा जहां महिलाओं को दबाया जाता है उनके बारे में बोलने में तुम्हारी फटती है।  
You are ultra hypocrite."
"I saw the video, as usual it was good...but the main question remains about TOXIC feminism. If women are getting the work done same as men then yeah pay them equally, if not then why pay them equally. If they're not doing anything equal to men then why equal things for them. There are a lot of jobs where women don't want to get into. 
I'm not against equal things for them, I just demand the equal output from them to get what they want"
make video on Pakistan elections and democracy
Druv bhai big fan
Plz make video on farmer's
So all Homo sapiens are similar but not not equal example two women working in office one is CEO and other is cleaner so both are similar female but not equal
No farm no food

Well! you compared chapri with alpha male! You are wrong! An alpha man is always a fiminist. Dont criticize an alpha male ever. Or may be you dont know the definition of being alpha.
9:26 the best part of the entire video
"Giving equal rights to females can ruin the country cause as womens start to work as men do there will be a decline in population of country for example take the case of japan
Giving rights is okay buy dont get flown away and make women work for long hours even for men cause it will only result in imbalance in society"
Long live Toxic Masculinity
Don’t go and learn from chapries or dhruv rathee just jordan Peterson
THIS VIDEO SHOULD BE TELEVISED
if women needs similar rights then first make of all of The Reserve seats for women in bus train and other vehicles
How much did you get from Feminists for this video?
Thank u very much dhruv sir ❤❤
Pani or aag alag hai lekin both requirements in the world is same
Moral of the video - don't be a chapri and stay away from them
Sahi ❤
Dear dhruv sir pls make video on bride market in india. Like haryana and rajashthan ... Maharashtra
Salute to you 🫡❤️
"That ""Chappri"" was personal.😂😂😂😂"

"Do not waste your time in a complete 10 minutes he does not address any issues. Both the title and title picture are misleading. 

He is only bashing guys for 10 mins."
Such a informative video
👑you dropped this.
"What r the rights that women don't have in camparison to men!. 
Men and women r in complementary roles to each other.todays feminism promotes half half share concept in every aspect of life ,which is not realistic and leads to breaking of family system."
We have islamic rule.... ALHUMDULILLAH
One of the most hypocritical thing happened in this video is that Dhruv Stereotypically added Pink Background to his Video and he addressed his stereotype that Womaen like Pink as always..
Great video
West Bengal ki news cover Karo Dhruv Bro🎉
Dhruv rather is like this type of videos which is generated by you but whenever you make video on the political contex I don't like that.
🤣🤣🤣🤣Bhai teri wife khud tujhse choti hai..
See how he doesn’t even talk about those movies waaah
"24:03 normally i dont prefer watching your videos, but i watched this one, and your ans to this questionn that you gave i think its very wrong , as acc to me the right ans would be ""that no strong  feminists openly says againsts these things as they also want to keep themseleves away, yes maybe they do some small tweets or videos, but all those are never getting that attention which can make us feel that even feminists are againts these worng shits, simply we dont get that msg on a big scale"""
"I like your content and mostly it’s always very unbiased however, this video of yours does not touch point the equality properly. There is a difference between complete equality and equality for convenience. Feminist now a days are demanding equality for convenience. I’ve never seen a woman strike for, driving taxis, doing the labor work, or even having dream to fight at the borders in army and many more. Also our bodies operate very differently both physically and emotionally  which leads to different outcomes. There can’t be equality however, we should focus on women rights and men rights separately. Men suffers more than women check the stats"
Hy please make a video on kisaan andolan2.0
Subarna isaac  ke  bare  topic  bono
I was shocked how he can explain such a thing in a very short words and describe it.
Are you a feminist?
In feminism the meaning of the word doesn't represent it purpose and is just to give privilege to woman which is not wrong but this power is being misused by some women which is very dangerous for normal innocent men thats all. But feminist doesn't care about that.
"Bro living in 1900s.

Stupid thoughts. And stupid opinions
If we look at the western country now we all know it's not a good thing to follow their foot path.
"Since years men have been cheating their wives while going to wars special brothels made for them. Same is happening now, in metro cities clubs or pubs you find married and committed boyfriends hunting for women. While they still manage to fool their women, most still get married because some naive human utterly dependent on them and also fear of losing his materialistic approach not leave him. This behaviour was never called out. Still women find such men attractive and still such men have a happy married life but what about women? 
Women are emotional beings and when they realise that his love is different from theirs, some find their whole world crashing down. I haven't seen men suffering from feminism till now but have seen women suffering, and many ignore for their peace because money or not, you can buy a public hoe or even a private hoe exclusive for you. Then men, cry out for not getting unconditional love when the whole concept of love they have changed for us. All jotts down to the testosterone getting okay with many normal looking women than one beautiful one. Variety they want, selfish they become and purity they desire."
🗿🗿
Thank you Dhruv bhaiya just bcz of you now I understand the difference between right and wrong ❤
The fact that dhruv always spread such good values among the people which makes him the Real influencer

"Here are the differences between men and women. Fun facts
•	Men's skin is about 25% thicker than women's due to higher collagen density.

❤❤
I accept your concern mr dhruv rathee but why you always target Hinduism and beleives for explaining these concepts what about islamic do they encourage feminism? You talk about christian society but i never saw you talk about anything regarding islamic not only no one in YouTube will never talk is this what you call equality? if we are discussing about then we should definitely discuss about every aspect of it but hiding the truth will not make it vanish one or the other day it comes out so whenever you make any video try not to target someone especially i hope you understood what i meant
Sharing Done ✅
Apki is video se soch ko Naya ayam mila hai
Anyone here to talk me ❤
👍👍👍
Very few people undrstand feminism If feminism gives equal rights to women in society means they are also equal responsible for society.but most of them misinterpreted feminism and spread nudity/ vulgarity/ alcoholism. and degraded moral responsibility towards society. And  this gives opportunity to patiariarchy mindset people to raise voice against feminism. A lack of complete awareness can be seen among majority of women but not in all women. Hope this video should help
Tu khud Cancer hai
"Bro actually apko thoda ye sochna chahiye ki jab God ne hi male or Female ko bilkul different bnaya h.. Make and female ki strength bhi different hai then aap God ko challange kar rhe ho ki apne hume different bnake accha nhi kra... Wo bat alag h ki kahi sare topics ese h jisme hume female ku sunni chahiye, or kai Sare ese mamle hai jisme male ki sunni chahiye... We have different rights... M not saying men are better then female... Both are important but in different scenerios"
"I'm not agreeing with your this thought.... For an example after divorce why only girls get alimony, why not boys... If you talk about equality then, it should apply on all the matter ....."

"Dhruv, you are quite smart, I must say. You know how to evade the topic which was to be discussed and mould the entire discussion into a particular corner. The discussion was about movies showcasing toxic & pseudo-feminism but you centered the whole video around ""alpha male chapri boys"" and their views on feminism. Also, you still didn't answer the main question : ""How can you justify Gangs of Wasseypur and Breaking Bad as cult classics and accuse Animal, having the same cinematic treatment ?"" You made a ""fiery"" review of Animal and put out statements about its consumers pretty wildly, what some people were asking you to was make a review on films such a ""Thank you for coming"" and ""Four More Shots"", but you took the other route. Clearly you always have a biasness & propaganda to serve a particular audience :) The real smart ones will understand this."
"Feminism means different things to different people. Whereas it is desirable for women to achieve economic success, it does not look like a good idea to sleep with random men. That's true for men as well. You would not consider a man in high regard if he sleeps around with too many women.  

I think it is intellectual dishonesty to first say ""well you believe in equality between men and women; hence you are a feminist"" and then automatically assume my opinion on sleeping around or making money by showing your butthole to the internet."
very informative video! thank you dhruv

"Intitally your logic makes sense but further in the video it begins to go out of any logic, if women are given maternity leave for 6 months why not men to help their wives this issue is very personal to me bcz when I was born my father was given only 15 days of leave to help my mother all the other 6 weeks of postpartum were delt by her all alone bcz his posting was distant af call that equality and then we'll see"

"I do not completely agree with Dhruv's opinion here but I believe men and women are complementary to each other and they should not be presented as competitors. There are specialities of women which men don't possess and vice versa. It is not just about some organs or physical strength differences between men and women but also psychological differences that make them best suited for different roles.
The protest should be against abuse of women and considering them inferior in every aspect. That should be changed."
Who can support me being umatti of Muhammad S.A.W❤
"To all the brainwashed dhruv rathee fan

"Yes . Mere friend bhi ye bolte h terko kya tension shadi hoajyegi.

"The crux of the matter lies in the harsh realities we face today. While legal frameworks advocate for gender equality, the prevailing issue is the societal acceptance of this principle. Take, for instance, the disparity seen in dating app culture, where a significant portion of women match with a select few men, perpetuating skewed dynamics. Documentaries like ""Indian Sons in Jail"" shed light on the misuse of laws that seemingly favor women, leading to a troubling notion of ""women always being right.""

This imbalance extends to legal matters, where many men find themselves disadvantaged, especially in cases of infidelity where alimony demands can still be made. The current legal landscape seems to place an undue burden of trust solely upon men, leaving them vulnerable in a society increasingly driven by self-interest.

While some women may adhere to fairness, the systemic bias remains a stark reality for many men, leaving them with little recourse. The shift from a perspective of all men being right to one where all women are perceived as such isn't progress—it's a distortion of justice.

Moreover, these laws often fail where they're needed most, as many cases go unreported, exacerbating mental health issues and even costing lives. The elites, untouched by such laws, further complicate the lives of the middle class, while influencers like Dhruv Rathee seemingly overlook these critical issues.

India's constitutional ethos of ensuring innocence prevails, even if guilty escape, falters in addressing the gender imbalance plaguing society. The erosion of family values and mental well-being underscores the urgent need for legal reforms that truly address societal needs.

The issues extend beyond gender dynamics, impacting population decline, job scarcity, and relationship dynamics. It's imperative to reassess the efficacy of current feminist ideologies and prioritize solutions that benefit all, not just a select few.

In a country like India, grappling with multifaceted challenges, it's essential to address these issues comprehensively and embark on meaningful dialogue and action for a more equitable future.


Im looking here for the views of not only law that gets formed but also the general impact of removing the narcissistic idiology of one gender while including the very same of the other. Majority or minority it does impact and place one gender at the heed of the other and the third wave feminism, also killing a large part of idologies necessary for the society, that include a concept of family, monogamy, diffrences between biological concepts of men and female harmones and the incredibly difficult dialogue, of the whole ideology, and its impact in reality,and it's ineffectiveness, and this video had it been made in 2000's , would be sufficient, but the fact of the matter is it's 2023. And i will not accept , the sheer dismissal of a major problem of 2024, based on the statistics of 50 years old ones and it makes no sense rather than just to appeal to the 100s of videos as such. Now lastly me taking the time to write a long comment and then edit it continuously to be able to to convey my point is not to just diss a respectable creator such as Dhruv rathee, but instead my respect for him, and how i think this video could've been more informative and not lack a complete dismissal of the other point of view to just meaningless jargon, in the last few minutes of the video. I as a 2024 male , refuse to apologise for the mistakes of something i wasn't the party to. While dissmising my generations reality, as a penance or just a represcussion of the past. Cuz i see no value in it, and hope to open a dialogue of discussion with dhruv himself. Which i hope he takes the time to read and reach out as well. Thats my 2 cents."

"Okay if women want equal rights then we should have equality everywhere. For example 

1) women should compete in sports with men
2) Women should work labor jobs and work as hard as any men in that field
3) Why most women dont study science  and engineering.
4) Most importantly women should support families financially just on der own. 
5) women should go 50/50 in every thing 
6) If men beat up  women then it should not be considered domestic  abuse. Instead just condemn as small minor crime
7) also we should hire equal.number of women soldiers as men soldiers 
8) Also women should not leave the country during wars."

"If they we all are supporting feminism means equality... Then I hope to see everywhere females also doing daily wage labouring everywhere like mens like drainage cleaning, Railway track repairing etc. and also hope to see mens doing all the home services in upcoming days without any social interference.

"In the ""free world,"" all genders should have the freedom to pursue their desires in areas such as education, politics, and work. However, in the name of feminism, women today often feel pressured to excel academically and professionally, which can be disheartening. Feminism should offer girls choices and freedom rather than imposing obligations on them. It's essential to recognize that societal changes take time; the progress achieved in education and career opportunities over the past 50-100 years cannot instantly override thousands of years of societal evolution."

काम क्रोध लोभादि मद प्रबल मोह कै धारि।
Lust, anger, greed, pride etc., constitute the most powerful army of Ignorance.
काम, क्रोध, लोभ और मद आदि मोह (अज्ञान) की प्रबल सेना है।

तिन्ह महँ अति दारुन दुखद मायारूपी नारि॥43॥
But among them all the fiercest and the most troublesome is that incarnation of Måyå (the Lordís deluding potency) called woman.
इनमें मायारूपिणी (माया की साक्षात् मूर्ति) स्त्री तो अत्यंत दारुण दुःख देने वाली है॥43॥

CHAUPAI
सुनु मुनि कह पुरान श्रुति संता। मोह बिपिन कहुँ नारि बसंता॥
Listen, O sage: the Puråƒas, the Vedas and the saints declare that woman is like the vernal season to the forest of ignorance.
हे मुनि! सुनो, पुराण, वेद और संत कहते हैं कि मोह रूपी वन (को विकसित करने) के लिए स्त्री वसंत ऋतु के समान है।

जप तप नेम जलाश्रय झारी। होइ ग्रीषम सोषइ सब नारी॥
Like the hot season she dries up all the ponds and lakes of Japa (the muttering of prayers), austerity and religious observances.
जप, तप, नियम रूपी संपूर्ण जल के स्थानों को स्त्री ग्रीष्म रूप होकर सर्वथा सोख लेती है॥1॥

काम क्रोध मद मत्सर भेका। इन्हहि हरषप्रद बरषा एका॥
Again, lust, anger, pride and jealousy are so many frogs as it were; like the rainy season woman is the only agency that gladdens them all.
काम, क्रोध, मद और मत्सर (डाह) आदि मेंढक हैं। इनको वर्षा ऋतु होकर हर्ष प्रदान करने वाली एकमात्र यही (स्त्री) है।

दुर्बासना कुमुद समुदाई। तिन्ह कहँ सरद सदा सुखदाई॥2॥
Even so latent desires of a vicious type are like a bed of lilies, to which, like the autumn, she is ever agreeable.
बुरी वासनाएँ कुमुदों के समूह हैं। उनको सदैव सुख देने वाली यह शरद् ऋतु है॥2॥

धर्म सकल सरसीरुह बृंदा। होइ हिम तिन्हहि दहइ सुख मंदा॥
All the different virtues are like a bed of lotuses; like the middle of winter, woman, who is a source of base (sensuous) pleasure, blights them all.
समस्त धर्म कमलों के झुंड हैं। यह नीच (विषयजन्य) सुख देने वाली स्त्री हिमऋतु होकर उन्हें जला डालती है।

पुनि ममता जवास बहुताई। पलुहइ नारि सिसिर रितु पाई॥3॥
Again, the overgrowth of the Yavasa plant in the shape of mineness flourishes when the close of winter in the shape of woman appears.
फिर ममतारूपी जवास का समूह (वन) स्त्री रूपी शिशिर ऋतु को पाकर हरा-भरा हो जाता है॥3॥

पाप उलूक निकर सुखकारी। नारि निबिड़ रजनी अँधियारी॥
For owls in the shape of sins woman is a delightful night thick with darkness.
पाप रूपी उल्लुओं के समूह के लिए यह स्त्री सुख देने वाली घोर अंधकारमयी रात्रि है।

बुधि बल सील सत्य सब मीना। बनसी सम त्रिय कहहिं प्रबीना॥4॥
Even so reason, strength, virtue and truth are all so many fishes as it were; and woman, so declare the wise, is like a hook to catch them.î
बुद्धि, बल, शील और सत्य- ये सब मछलियाँ हैं और उन (को फँसाकर नष्ट करने) के लिए स्त्री बंसी के समान है, चतुर पुरुष ऐसा कहते हैं॥4॥

DOHRA

अवगुन मूल सूलप्रद प्रमदा सब दुख खानि।
ताते कीन्ह निवारन मुनि मैं यह जियँ जानि॥44॥
A young woman is the root of all evil, a source of torment and a mine of all woes. Therefore, bearing this in mind, O sage, I prevented your marriage.
युवती स्त्री अवगुणों की मूल, पीड़ा देने वाली और सब दुःखों की खान है, इसलिए हे मुनि! मैंने जी में ऐसा जानकर तुमको विवाह करने से रोका था॥44॥"

"While I completely understand and believe Women should get equal rights.... Every community has its own restrictions and law for women and modern day world would deny the fact that these restrictions and laws were created or introduced to maintain a balance between Humans in many areas in aspect of life. 

Yes, women can work, they can learn, they can educate themselves, they are free to go anywhere but the catch is if both Men and Women work who would look after their family? Who would take of their children? Who would look after their parents? 

Women are way stronger than man in many ways but men would still be superior. I not against the equality we are talking here about. I am only trying make my a point that Men and Women co-exist its cycle of life, Nature and system created by Earth or its people to maintain a certain balance, peace, harmony and love to this planet that we men are destroying. 

Women is stronger as they have a ability to empower herself and her family. Women can give anyone hope, Women can rectify or undo mistakes (I don't mean women pay for men's mistakes) men would do. Without women population wouldn't grow and it isn't in men's nature to give a birth to a child. It is a women and nature has created her for certain purposes that we should understand. 

I rest my case here concluding it by saying, Women is free to do anything but equality is something they should never look for and its against nature's law of mankind.

I am assuming few people wouldn't like this comment. I apologize if I hurt anyone's sentiment by this."
Sir you feel animal is Cancer and you said Gangs of wasapur is cult movie any explanation on that ?
"Though I promote equal rights, but...
An interesting point here:
A man with a small brain(abnormal) and one with a proper brain will have different rights. Similarly, men and women have some major differences apart from organs like strength and love for children(scientifically and universally proven), why is it not ok for some rights to be there for the good of both women or men?"
Social life in India is very different from social life in western countries. Things that are considered normal in India are shocking for west and same is vice versa
"Dhruve Bhai hamare islaam mein dono ke rights equal hai,  but kuch chizon mein aadmi superior hai aur kuch chizon mein aurat superior hai  .. example,  Ghar mein chor agaya to pehle aadmi jakar us chor se nipata hai woh yeh nahi kahta ke hum equal tum chor se jakar lado.. to yahan par upar Wale ne aadmi ko physically takhat dekar superior banaya hai..aur bohat se cheezon mein aurat superior hai ..jaise ke maa ke khadmon ki niche jannat hai..."
"yaar feminism means that ladko aur ladkio ko equal rights mille right… to 23:42 people aap keh rahe ho ki ladki ne uss ladke ko thapad maare and it was not rightto kissi bhi feminist le ladki ko aupport nhi kia… ok agreed but unhone ladke ko support kyu nhi kia… isn’t he a human… baat to equal rights ki ho rahi hai na to sirf ladki ke saath kuch galat hoga then “femenist people” support them but ladke ke saath kuch hoga to they will not support the girl but ladke ka kya hua
if the roles were reversed agar ladke ne ladki ko mara hota to to samaaj ladke ko kha hi jaati aur ladka kabhi marta bhi nhi usko aise kyuki usko pata hai ki aise “femenist world” mai uski aukat kya hai… usko uthake jail mai daal dete and what not… kya aapki ladki ke ssath aisa hua… aap bata sakte ho ki vo abhi kaha hai
“If feminism means females getting equal rights as males, then it also means male getting equal rights as females.”
Animal film mai anil kapoor ne ranveer kapoor pe thapad ki baarish krdi and that was exceptable… chalo chodo uss bare zyada nhi bolna but try replying my first argument"

"i disagree with u slightly ,you are human Dhuru a logical. love and salute u from pakistan."
I didn't know real meaning of Feminism till now. I also think that's the feminism which we saw on Social media. Thanks for explaining us difference Dhruv Sir🙏
There is a difference between feminism and matriarchy. Thanks Dhruv for making that clear🙌🏻
Nice video…!!!
Dhruv Rathee u r great ❤
Good information 💯

I think there should be something in between feminism and patriarchy
"देहज लेना गलत है तो शायद निर्वाह-व्यय या निर्वाह निधि भी गलत है और हां मैं समानता में विश्वास रखता हूं।




If taking dowry is wrong then perhaps living expenses or subsistence fund(Alimony )is also wrong and yes I believe in equality."
I wonder why instead of coining the concept as 'feminism' the simple and more clear word equality was not used. It creates a wrong sense of preferential division in favour of females.
Dhruv Rathee self proclaimed godman 😂
"Why the term feminism is not called Equalism? I think the misconception initially comes from the name and then this misconception grows for toxic films, memes, and figures like Neha Dhupia."
"I really liked your previous all videos, but this one is totally irrelevant and bullshit. Any extremist thought is bad for society. Also you will never speak of judicial right that men don't have. Because that won't get you this much views !"
Ok girls will be girls 😂
I love your videos its inspire me ❤
Gender equality is a modern myth. Men and women have distinct personalities and abilities and are fine tuned to do different things.
I am 24 yrs girl and I am feminist and I love his content and right wing people manipulate his videos they shows his videos out of context I hate right wing people
Respect❤
"definitely, men and women are biologically different but that doesn't mean one is superior to the other."
"ek admi jo apne do pairon pe chal sakta hai aur ek admi jo wheelchair pe baitha hai dono ko equal rights nahi milte exactly. for example, wheelchair pe baitha hua admi ke paas jobs aur exams ke liye quota hota hai and ek wheelchair pe baitha hua admi army me join nahi kar sakta."

"What a wonderful video....
Truly loved it and learnt a lot...

But I've some issues with your point @23:28 that no feminist have supported those views of Neha Dhupia...
But here is the problem ,the negation or assailant condemnation over such ridiculous statements never comes out from the feminist side at such steep extent than if a man does something wrong...
We never heard that. Might be in private or in their close circle they condemn such things...
But publicly it never comes out to such an extent....
See, for the betterment of the society condemnation amplitude from the feminist side should be the same for both the genders...
Silent condemnation will be unfair for some dumb alpha morons and some sane person like me as well 😂😂😂"
"So, the definition of feminism sounds fair in the ideal world. If you are a humanist, you are a feminist. Great! 

The problem is that the feminism ideas of today's girls are selective. A girl looking for an arranged marriage wants a guy who earns way higher than her, forget about accepting somebody who earns lesser than her. So, according to you she's having ""patriarchical"" values. However, the same girl wants equal (it's often more when they say equal) rights after the marriage. Now, she's a feminist. A double agent!

Often times, women seek feminism only when it favors to them. But, when it isn't so favorable, they are happy to off load that responsibility over to men. When you ask for equal rights, you should also be ready to take up equal responsibilities. And if that was the case, we would have seen equal number of women and men fighting the war for Ukraine.. I think men are just too nice to be ready to die for their families while women are busy with their equal rights campaign."

Great one
"The reason why feminism is associated with all the stupidity on social media, OTT and Bollywood is that, these people CLAIM themselves to be feminists. They claim to promote feminism through their work and spend a lot of money on marketing and advertising. So we see them more often than any other work from a genuine person. So people who don't have any idea about this topic will obviously think that the SO-CALLED feminist content that they are watching is what feminism stands for."
this time not gonna agree 100% with u
Dhruv Rathee is just a cuck.
Don't change the thumbline it's perfect 👌 😊❤
"THERE WERE NO FEMINIST ON TITANIC.
WHEN INDIAN TV SHOWS AND MOVIES SHOWS A WOMAN SLAPPING A MAN EVERYONE IS LIKE GO GIRL, BUT MEN DOES CU@KS LIKE DHRUV MAKES 25 MIN VIDEO Saying how men are bad.
WE ARE NOT SEEING FEMINIST LIKE HERE IN COMMENTS SECTION IN RUSSIA AND UKRAIN WAR, WOMEN ARE PARTYING IN MALDOVA WHILE MEN ARE DYING IN TRENCHES . 
IN AMERICA U AS A MAN FORCED  TO JOIN SELECTIVE SERVICES AND WOMEN DON'T HAVE TO.
WHEN SHIT HITS THE FAN THESE DHRUV RATHEE AND FEMINIST RUNS 1ST. 
ALL THE INVENTIONS AND MODERN CONVENIENCES ARE MADE AND MAINTAINED BY MEN, WOMEN DON;T CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY, EVEN 70% OF COLLEGE GRADUATES WERE WOMEN IN 2023. 
2/3 DEBTS ARE HOLD BY WOMEN 8/10 FEMALE BILLIONAIRE GOT THEIR MONEY FROM DIVORCES OR INHERITANCE .
WOMEN GET 30-70% LESS TIME FOR SAME CRIME AS A MEN. (US CENSUS FOR CRIME AND DOJ 2020).
WANT MORE I HAVE BOOKS ON THIS AND STUDIES TO BACK UP ALL MY POINTS."
Good job and keep it up! Always come up with informative videos. I just want to remind you not to emphasize every negative comment.
It's common sense by dhruv but people making it complex
Absolutely agree with YOU! Thanks for sharing such a great contemporary issue…
You are every woman's dream... I wish I had a brother like you or a friend. But I'm lucky my father is the best father in the world ❤

Equality does not matter justice matters.

Bhai is generation mae yeah familist hi deah barbad kar rha aur ladkiyon ko bhi aur ladko ko Marne par suicide krne par majbur karta h
indirectly abuse hinduism good job
"bro the way men think and the way women think are very different... this has nothing to do movements or society but everything to do with genetic memories that has been getting updated for thousands of years. Just a decade of societal movement isn't going to change anything. Just look at US where feminism is at peak, men are the most miserable because women prefer & CHOOSE not to care about men and many actively seek dangerous men who would be abusive towards them"
"Yes, i completely agree with dhruv in every point..... But diff is feminism doesn't act or have an opinion on toxic movies ( fem based ) but they do act on movies like animal..... And in this video too dhruv say ""animal is cancer for society"" but does not have anything to talk about "" thank you for coming"" like the way he is presenting it, is wrong.... It's my pov"

Bro you changed my views.❤
This type of content makes us feel using social media is actually worth!! A true gentleman..💯❤️
"There's no harm in accepting our differences. It only becomes problematic when we use our differences as a weapon for discrimination. Feminism started as a movement to bring about political, economic and social equality between sexes but believe it or not modern feminism is nothing but misandry in disguise."
दुर्गा वाहिनी के अलावा और कोई examples नहीं मिला 😂 किसी और पर बोलने के लिए डर हैं आप में
"THANK YOU for putting this out dhruv!!! This was literally much needed.  Being a teen myself, i’m tired and frustrated of seeing “chapri” comments on reels and even in real life, who talk nonsense because they literally don’t understand the meaning of word Feminism. Ab kuch log honge jo bolenge aakr “Female audience maang rha hai” , I don’t get why people are so brainless and blind about logical things. 🤡"
"False rape cases, False dowry and 498a cases and Alimony per video banao...
Why Indian married men Suicide rate increase ?"
"Thankyou Dhruv for a video like this. Social media has brainwashed the youth enough! We need videos like this. Truly, Thankyou."
Men must be assertive not abusive 👍
Sir i have a challenge for you you should read 4 most popular religions each for 60 days starts with Buddhism then Hinduism and there 7 popular parts which is in Hinduism then Christianity after that islam and then and then compare all religions knowledges with todays science read with their only holy books and prech their preachings for 60 days every thing what are in books to do
❤❤❤
"Feminism is not just powering women over men, its equality for all genders, inclunding the lgbtqia+ community, which will make the entire population much much less stressed. Men suffer from a lot of stress due to 'providing for the family' and being the bread sole bread winner of the house. Feminism will help everyone progress faster."
"If women find a rich men,then will ditch the middle class men"

Proudly believe in patriarchy 👍

I think RIGHT TO EQUALITY is the biggest joke because I have given the jee mains exam and fees for boys is 1000Rs and for girls it is 800Rs so we're the right to equality goes.😢
Alpha male 😂😂 Biggest Joke these days
Always❤ satisfied with your video   Actual Same thoughts ❤

Islam ne aurat ko rights diye hen wo kisi dharam ne nhi diya... men woman ko islam ne jahan alag rakha hy wahan alag rakho jahan ek sath rakha hy wahan ek sath rakho
Great video!!
"First of all, ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE VIDEO CONTENT, it's just what the present society lacks and fails to understand. Even the video doesn't cover all the views but it does a really good job at pushing the issue, for example at 24:00 , feminism may not have supported the girl, and it is wrong to term this feminism but may this have been the other way round we would see all the feminists supporting the girl, but did we see a single feminist support the guy? I'm not sure if there was any but the issue was hardly seen ANYWHERE in the media, this is what feminism fails at, where are the equal rights for that man? 

I truly think there should be another video regarding men's issues and right only (rights such as the husband and wife's laws from our constitution which make literally about no sense)"
Not a single video on Kejriwal's case regarding supreme court😅
Absolutely absolutely right bhaiya
"I don't know but as a child who has grown up in chandigarh ,I used to read the newspaper and they always portrayed a lot of cases where women accused men of thing they didn't do (and they were found out to be false in the end ) and other scams like them which always made me inherently a bit cautious of women . I would like to think I am a feminist but that inherent fear of those cases has always made me not fully invested in the movement . But who knows might just be my insecurity or something. What's your all thoughts?"
@dhruvrathee please  make a video  about the topic of women  play a role in transnational crime....as soon as possible  😊
Asslaum alekwoom dhurw bhai ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"I disagree with the onion and your research. While I generally agree with you most of the time, it's important to note that just because some famous people support feminism doesn't necessarily mean their IQ level is higher than ours. Being famous doesn't guarantee correctness, and I don't believe females should be denied the right to work.

Point 1: If a girl is saying we should have cerebral opportunities, I agree they should. However, claiming complete equality in capabilities between genders is not naturally and scientifically accurate. Women may not perform physically demanding work as men do, and they may not develop the same level of muscularity.

Point 2: Feminists advocating for equality are not expressing rocket science. They are simply stating that men and women should be complete equally. but not Ready to work rough work they should not use ""complete"" they should use the correct word ""cerebral"" opportunities.

Point 3: *If all girls are equal, they should not limit themselves to working only in comfortable environments* like air-conditioned spaces. Equality should extend to all fields, including labor-intensive jobs such as agriculture, construction, the military, mining, welding, plumbing, and mechanics and more... if they are not equal, we are agreeing they should work in comfortable environments. if they are forcing, we are complete equal they should agree to work in where difficult or muscular work have, we are not for that. then it's call Doglapan and for that we do not agree and ready."
Bhai Aaj toh maza aa gaya
Please make a video to understand LGBTQ movement i am really confused about it
bhai ne ik naya panga le liya
very good thought all woman are same    .    ..in equal in man as per your topic is our gharnth is also same
Tum kya chahte ho aurato ko samaan bechne ka Sahara bana de... kyuki aurto ko sirf nang dikha kar add bana kar company chala Rahi hai aurato ko sirf feminist ke naam aise hi istemal kiya ja raha hai
"feminism would be ideal if only men and women were biologically and mentally and more allyly were same. they are way too different i support right to equal opportunity but i dont support that men and women are same they are different and equally important to run a home, a town , a society, a state, a nation and the whole world. 
anyways today s feminist are nothing but male hating degenerates who wants matriachy and are full lust to get men power without any responsiblity with ego issues, in short they are retard brainrots whom i dont care take seriously."
Every individual is influenced by their (Parents)
"I m from PAKISTAN i m a feminism woman but now a time the definition of femisim is going in wrong side because now a time women and girls think feminism is about upload N**** picture or show main female body only for showing that they are a independent women or same sex marry or live life as play girl but REAL FEMINISM IS TOTALLY OPPOSITE TO IT 
FEMINISM IS ABOUT EQUAL RIGHT IN ECONOMY ,SOCIAL,POLICTICALLY AND RIGHT TO VOTE ONLY .Every REILIGOUS in world teach live a simple life and dnt show Body in PUBlic .
DEAR women always remember that you are mostly beautiful creation of creator .ALWAYS give repeat and take repeat and never left your innocent PARENT in this evil world . Every theory in world is not 100% right not all mens are evil and not every women are angel."

"hello Dhruv Sir I am very confused Why R u not making video on farmers protest running just now not only in India(Delhi) but also in France, Jermany, Eurpope etc 
I personally request U to do it pls."
Finally someone said this 👏🏻
"men and women  are equal but not same 
2+2 = 4
3+1 = 4
equal 
but not same 

same means identical"
Extremely well described… well done
"Awesome explanation, doing great job!"
"Hey Dhruv, loved the intention and impact of this video. Because you do your research well, I also wanted to highlight how the word ""chappri"" has a casteist implication. Chhapris are a caste-oppressed community of people who make or mend chhappars, temporary roofs. Oppressed caste people try to look blingy to access the privilege of wealth but upper caste folk look down on this transformation and associate their caste to cringe. Maybe next time you can be more mindful about this language? Thanks. Continue your well intentioned work 👍"
"See that's what? Every time we tried starting a conversation about how shitty Animal was some dumbhead will pop up w ""Are Thankyou for coming bhi toh toxic thi"".

Ufffff you are epic❤
Feminism is a silent poison which destroys the peace of society.. dhruv is just glorifying the positive side of feminism...
"they don't want equality they want equality with benefits, feminism its all women's advocacy not fot equality"
But I mostly believe in if a woman values more give her the value. Bz if everyone is equal then value will be dismissed.
Bhai kehna kiya chahte ho😂😂
Can you please make an video on vegan food or how this culture started🙂
"I personally believe the core reason that nowadays we see movies like Thank You For Coming and Animal, and the overall negative stigma in society about Feminism is because most people consider Feminism and Matriarchy synonymous, they neglect the fact that it also talks about men's rights. They think Feminism was born to replace Patriarchy and give rise to a matriarchal society. Most are unaware that it's not the case............Thank You Dhruv Bhaiya for highlighting this clear difference and I think its high time people are made aware of this clear difference......................................."
Very good Dhruv.

"Celebrity se nahi seekhna h ki zindagi kaise jeena h, wese bhi na ye political science graduate h aur na hi social activist, female audience ko khush karne ka agenda h sab bolna inke liye aur Feminism ke nam use karke ab Matriarchy aur exploitation, misuse of law hi ho raha h."
Dimag aurto me jyada hota h
"मुझे कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता कि आपका जेंडर क्या है, मैं एक इंसान होने के तौर पर हर एक जीवात्मा का सम्मान करता हूं, और मेरे लिए महिला समानता की बजाए इंसानी समानता की बात कुछ अधिक मायने रखती है क्योंकि मुझे लगता है कि जब आप इंसान को इंसान मानने की बजाए जब महिला-पुरुष के रूप में विभक्त करतें हैं तो फिर महिला सशक्तीकरण भी आवश्यक हो जाता है"

"As you said salman Rushdie, I quit you"
Dhruv rathee is absolutely the most educated and thoughtful youtuber ever . Whole world needs to see this video . specially the toxic people who create misogyny/ dominance just to satisfy their ego
"It’s is really sad that we as Indian (form global east) discussing about Ideas like Feminism and Patriarchy  which are totally western and totally silly Ideas.If we look at the  philosophy’s  of east and west then there is a different, soul purpose of western peoples are to become successful while the sole purpose of Indian people was to achieve Moksh.there is a clear difference in purpose. So Indian patriarchy was totally different from western patriarchy.If we look at our past ,then our society was much more peaceful then western society.Patriarchy is all about devision of responsibility among men and women according to their natural capabilities ,ability and disabilities and for the over all betterment of the society.But yes there is a need to re-draw boundaries between men and women in the present context .Also sometime we sacrifice some of our goal (desire ) for our loving one , for our family, for our nation,for our society and no one should think bad about it. You are saying that Patriarchy brainwashed women but can u surely tell me you are not brainwashed or Imposing western Ideas over us.Feminism is naturally promoting Individualism and at the end it will once again make us Animals I am sure.

 Stop always seeing things for WESTERN LENSES."
"No asked him to tell what real feminism is. He was supposed to make a video on the negative impacts of toxic feminine movies but he literally goes on and on against Sandeep vanga. Anyways, shit like this happens when a qualified stupid starts intellectualising every common sense thing😂😂😂😂"

@dhruvrathee please make a video on Saddam Hussein
what about muslim patriachy please give me muslims examples not hindus hind are feminist
"I'll tell you my take on this :-
Absolutely, all men and women are equal. And yes, i do believe that women should get equal rights, equal highest possible education, equal opportunities and equal pay as that of men.
BUT, i want to clarify the category of women that should be eligible to get this. Only those women, who are not married, or do not have a responsibility of the family, should pursue for their career. If a married women does a 9 to 5 job, who will take care of the kids? And who will look after the household work after all the tiredness of a 8 to 10 hour job? The work in a house is just as important as the work outside. Yes, it's a shame that women do not get enough credit and pay for managing the house, and we should talk on this matter, but this work is important for a family. And if you say that women can manage both, ask every women that if they get to choose only one, will they choose? The answer will be a yes.
A few years ago i heard a news from Bangalore that a women threw her handicapped son from her building because he was crying and distracting her from her job. No sane person would do this, and to stop this, the society has built some rules that applies to both men and women. I am not patriarchal, i am a feminist. Just not a irrational pseudo-feminist."

Good explaination on feminism but incomplete research and misinterpretation. Everything can't be dumped into two big subsets of Patriarchy and Femisnism
Should have focused more on what feminism does not mean and how it is selectively cherry picked in on all forums of discussion"
"Hi Dhruv,

Males were going out of house since ages for hunting, food, education, work, business etc. Divorce/Separation idea was almost not  exist in society those days(before 1950). But why at 1960-2024 time divorce rate is so high ! 

When mature public(specially educated males) should follow feminist(equality) ideas, but why females are having reservation in trains/metros, why higher legal favor exists for females ? Where is feminism getting followed !

If you able to give logical answer of these, I will ask more.."
I don't agree with him

Then why a earning women not married to non earning women?

"21 st century feminism:
boys-  what is your difficulty: I'm a physically challenged person/ scheduled caste or tribe
 girls- what is your difficulty: I'm a ""WOMAN""
feminists want equal rights but don't want to work equally. men has to dirty/ laborious work but women only want to do office work. What a feminism, dhruv bhayya, upar upar ke baathei kare, andar ki bathein bolna bhulgaye.
and men and women are not equal. men are more powerful physically and mentally than women."
"Here a dumb story 

The other day when i was walking back to my home from college I saw a accident of a school girl(under 18 without driving license) and a man in ig his 40s both were on 2 wheelers 
They both crashed and it was completely mistake of that girl for that happening but when a RTO officer nearby came he called police and took the man with them for crashing into the girl 
what does this mean!? btw this isnt the only case where men get arrested where mistake is of a girl in our country or even world what is going on with law at times not applying towards women at times?"

Feminism destroy females but nobody talk about this problem
On paper Feminism might be about Men's right as it is about Women's right. But you don't see it on tbe ground. On paper Mr. Modi follows the consitution but we know that is not true. There are only a handful of feminists who you would see fighting for men's right. And people like Neha Dhupia are a real threat to feminism in India. I feel you should have spend more time on people with her thoughts.
Always say wrong statement about all man

What about those women who take disadvantage of their position and power
"While I agree to all your points but I think you misunderstood Neena Gupta's interview . It was a very good interview actually because she said men and women are not equal where she meant women needs men equally how men needs women. That interview was on women who say that they don't need men just because they want to show they are strong and don't need men at all in their life. The interview was never about equal rights , there's difference . Women and men should have equal rights but physically and biologically we are different and that we need each other."

I don't support very much with this video's message. 😂
Agreed
"All points are absolutely valid. I have one more point to add. When parents start looking for a daughter in law, they have the list of qualities that they are looking for in the girl. But, they don't bother to teach their son the duties of a husband. The boy doesn't know the basic household chores. This is one of the reasons for fights between the couple after marriage."
"Dhruv rathee has been so much influenced by liberal, left wing ideology, I watch his videos because of the education purpose, but now he wants to influence the people by his political view, of course men and women needs to get equal opportunities, but are they. Equal, I mean look at the biological stand point are women do same labour work as men are capable do, men and women are different and in a healthy society they needs to do their own work, today's feminisn thought is that "" all men needs to die, they needs to do all the labour work and we are going to do all the easy work, and look at the western society, feminisn literally runing their society, Dhurv rathee is a Beta male who is highly influenced by this shitty ideology."

"These days alot of teenagers and young people are working out not for the health benefits but for building muscular bodies. They want 6/8 pack abs, triceps, good calves etc. This has a positive and a negative side. Could you make a video on this topic pls because some people like me dont know if this culture is right or wrong to follow."
hattttttt  LLLLLLLvvdddeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyy
Make a video on LGBTQ
Bro the problems with feminism or should I say toxic feminism came up when women are asking for matriarchy on the name of feminism and another thing where there are unjustified unequal rights given to women than men and the way most women are misusing it and against with no other women is raising voice while men stand with women who suffers with anything wrong. That is what this feminism has turned into a toxic wave.
I believe one day dhruv rathee makes history ❤
Thank you very much dhruv for talking on this topic without any biasnes.... I also believe in this feminism and I am feminists ❤❤
Beautifully explained ❤

"What is feminism 
1)Demanding equal pay in sports like wtf do you generate the revenue even for example no 1 tennis player can't defeat men's ranked 100th tennis player
2) demanding equal ranks in army  do you expect to command a men full of boiling blood commanded by a girl
May be in some rare case
3) Demanding equal pay in physical jobs women body isn't developed to work equally same all over month  telling this with personal experience 
4) biologically men and women are different not in terms of just organs but some jobs and work requires secretion of particular hormones to give a rush or push 
I can give 100s more examples but instead of demanding equality why don't we just respect our imparity
Dhruvee stop going to extreme left"
But girls have more reservation and facilities than boys. (Example- bus ticket is half for women but full for men)
"Feminists want equality..
Then call is equilism..❤  this will support both the sides & this will avoid confusion."

"From my perspective, equality is an artificial ideology. But it doesn't mean it is bad. I think no one can achieve 100% equality. Somehow, one of the gender will dominant the other through the time being of human civilization. Still, I support equality. Nevertheless, I also believe that there can be no high without low, no good without bad, NO MAN WITHOUT WOMEN, and vice versa."
Dhruv bhai Salman rashdi ko legendary mat kaho please edit kardo.
"People and thier perfect answer on gender equality that no one asked. Feminism is just a dillusion bro!!! Just because your wife/gf supports feminism doesn't mean you'll label us men as wrong. Yes, women should get equal respect but comparing women to men doesn't make any sense. Why this generation wants to change' the thought of women. Why is it shameful to be a good housewife?? Can women work like us men ? We got muscle for the hard work, not to mob floors and do the dishes... we will help our wife when she needs help. 
Bro really thought we will agree to his opinion by talking about depression we men face to divert our thoughts but listen, guys... don't let stupid opinion loose your muscularity. Its a gift from God. Control your lust and work hard and marry a feminist woman who truly understand what her role is in your life. We nee emotional partner not a competition. 
I love your voides bro! No personal hate but i just don't agree with you on this topic."

This is a bigger inequality and lots of innocent men are being put in jail for no reason. The emotions being suppressed for men issue can be dealt with later.

I am a feminist
Best influencer I have ever seen

We need more influencers like him. I have never seen a more educated and experienced person than him. True influencer ❤ >>>
"I don't have time to find fancy English words like ""normative conformity"", ""fallacy"", ""matriarchy"" blah blah blah to support my argument. But I hope if you understand simple Hindi and you have slightly higher sense than common sense, then you will understand what I am trying to say, so hear me out - 

Apko cool dikhne keliye hamesha society ke weaker side to hi support krna jaruri nahi hai. Agar saare aadmi mante hai ki aurat ko apne pati ko parmeshwar saman manna chaiye to kuch ""rational"" as you say and sensible mard bhi hote hai jo apni auratko devi ka roop mante hai. So instead saari ladies to ye sikhaya jaye ki patiko parmeshwar na mano kyu na ham saare aadmiyo ko sikhaye ki aap jitna parmeshwar hai utnahi appki aurat devi saman hai. Par nahi aap ko to jobhi cultural, traditional lagta hai aap fataak se usko logical angle deke logoko bahar ghasitne lagte ho. Aur rahi baat equal rights ki to haan aurato ko past mai bohot bhedbhav sehna pada hai but iska ye matlab nhi ki aurat har kaammai mard ki barabari kr sakti hai ya viceversa. Naturally/biologically mard stronger hote hai so physically harder tasks wo krte aa rahe hai aur aurat baki tasks jisme wo acchi hai wo krti aa rahi hai. Isko hamari bhasha mai efficiently ghar chalana kehte hai. Isme aapne pure aadmi prajatiko hi Villain ghoshit kr diya😂Haan aaj ye sab baatein point nhi banati, (as aaj major kaam aurate equally better way mai kr sakti hai) but aajbhi agar hum jhagadne lage ki physically harder tasks like military, construction works mai auratoko equal rights de toh economically hamara desh collapse kr jayega. (App hi ne ekbaar apne video mai kaha tha - ""Ki jab ekbar desh ki prime minister ek aurat bani thi toh hume bhi pata hai kya hua tha"") Ye mai nahi bolra ye aapne bola tha. 
Rahi baat ghar ke kaamo ki(kyoki aapko to utne tak hi samaj aata hai) to jo nahi kamata wo gharke kaam kre agar dono kamatae hai to dono milke kare.

Rahi baat office mai equal pay ki, toh mere college mai iss saal saari ladkiya place ho chuki hai badi badi MNCs mai (jo hame hi pata hai ki most of them kaam krneke bajay companiyoka kaam badhayengi) aur college ke some of the best coders unplaced baithe hai. Kaise? ""Womens quota"", ""Equal rights"" ""Diversity hiring"" Tadaaaaa!!!! Aur agar koi aurat sachmai apne kaam mai aadmiyo se acchi hai to usko equal nahi aadmiyose jyada pay kro ye mai bhi maanta hun. 
Basically, aadmiyo ko sudharo naki Aurato ko pura western cultural mindset deke desh ka innocence mat khatam karo.

I think you are one of the best person who can aware people about this serious issue. And govt. Can make a law on this if people raise their voice. This can save many innocent lives.

I'll do pushup  for every like in this comment for sure..😢😢😢😢
"But the fact is how many of these people are feminist? The definition of feminist only stayed in dictionary but not in reality. But these feminist mindset turns into matriarchy and patriachy thoughts. It's same way like we say *We believe in democracy*, but this democracy doesnt stand in any country... there isnt any country in the world which has 100% democracy. Democracy turns into some points of autocracy or dictatorship. 
What this feminism turns into?
1. Women are given full preference for Education and Opportunity. Govt provides women quota and zero cost for government exams. Corporates are mostly looking for women even if some women dont even deserve this.. this turns into a blackhole for some men who deserves this, Sometimes they dont even look for resumes. For so called 50% gender ratio, they ask silly questions from a women to provide a job.
2. Women have all the rights .. be it giving a false accusations or not. Lawyers and judges are too horny that they cant deny the fact that women can also be wrong.
3. Women get equal rights for everthing, yet they still want their husband to earn crazy amount of money. A man can marry a homeless girl but women wont even think if a guy earns less than a women.
4. Everyone has seen feminism during war. Men were bound to stay and protect their motherland and women were endulged with men of other nations to get settled. At that time feminist attitude of a women turned into patriarchy.
5. Women are  provided with all benefits of public transport, free tickets, free seats, free arguments and also love going to protest for not getting any benefit?

THIS IS FEMINISM... Real feminism means giving all the importance to a women..The point is why they innovated GENDER EQUALITY to a FEMINISM maybe because some men wants women to get attracted ??  if you point out these points then these women's feminist attitude will kick in yoooo!"
Thank you so much
"At least, there is someone who can reciprocate my feelings. I still remember when the nirbhaya case started, my dad read the newspaper which stated that kids should know what woman is, he used to give me sex education and why this case was no different from before cases. I really understand now what patriarchy is and how people only objectify women. This is a shareable and must know topic for younger generations. But the reality is people don't want to be misjudged because of peer pressure.. Man, get a life, it's your life and you should decide your life. I blame myself because i was under the same pressure for a long time until i decided "" bas ho gaya"". Now I'm happier than ever. Thank you Dhruv for bringing this topic upfront without any fear of people judging you. Keep spreading positivity and there are countless people to back you."
"It is totally disappointed me you didn't even talk about what issues men facing
As a human men are still struggling to get basic human rights and protection from constitution
Such as 
1. Sexual harrasment laws should be gender neutral
2. If a boy watches or capture half naked or naked images of girl will get 7 years jail but if girl does same with boy then no punishment
3. If a boy disrobe any girl he will get at least 7 year jail but if girl does same thing to boy then no punishment
4.If a girl make promise to marry and had relation with boy & at the time of marriage deny to marry him no punishment for her but if boy did same he will face rape charges, 10 years of jail and only on girls statement immediately arrest
5. If a wife had sexual relation with man other than her husband then no punishment for her instead if on this ground if husband ask divorce he has to pay alimony (only if she is in live in relationship with her boyfriends during marriage then alimony can avoided)if man does the same he can land in jail in 498a due to mental cruelty cause by his affairs to his wife and need to pay alimony to her.
5.if you live with your wife but didn't had sex. And wife gets pregnant by other man still its your responsibility to pay for child.
6.If wife does physical or mental cruelty to husband he can only divorce but still has yo pay alimony to her. If husband does same wife can complaint 498a on entire family can arrest. And gets the alimony.
7. If any girl accused you for rape only on her statement you can arrested and if case turn out to false no punishment for her (in some cases court applies nominal fine)
8. Stalking is offence only punishment for boys 
9. Verbal abuse , physical abuse , emotional abuse, econmical abuse , mental abuse all this can only happens to women only and only boys can punished as per constitution

So if you consider yourself a Faminist, equal Rights supporter then why you vant support equal rights for men also."
"I think it would have been more appropriate if you would have also included how bad some people use this word to exploit men and run away from responsibilities. There are two aspects of Everything and this video is based on only one targeting only one side of population, failing to be neutral and presenting a case of media bias."
Nice bro ❤❤
"👍🤔🧬🧠♂️🚻♀️🌍 I Feminist if it is about equal rights, while i am not if it is about gender equality. Genders are not equal, both have different roles and responsibilities, Non-Gender people can't exist. In every living creature, there are genders with different abilities according to science. Else we can just stop our Human Generation, unless humans discover a method for Artificial Human Generation. Nature is nature. I totally agree with how some women's rights are ruined in our societies in Pakistan & India, even mens rights are ruined by women sometimes. While we also have to accept the fact that the world is authorized&controlled by both men & women in a totally different Direct/Indirect ways logically/scientifically/historically. And the Most of the Patrialcal thinking is from nature & fits in it... Is dhuruv also Priotrical person, why he thinks that he should make this video as a man? I mean why most Men  raise the voice about feminism, women have their own voice as if the genders are equal. And while you talk about cheating Spouses, use Science & Nature to figure that why is it Ok for men & why not for women to have multiple men."

"You had quite emphasis on anti feminist women for some reason . I mean they too deserve same opportunities ,protection and integrity as human ,even if we don't align with them.  Also feminism is supposed to be focused on women not men. Men are strugglikg because of their ego ,they don't need services from feminists while belonging from oppressive class. Men can't be feminists Feminism isn't philosophy for everyone but movement for only women"

Yes
"There is one point I have to disagree with.

Men and women can't be divided into  teams. Actually atleast women can.

In my personal life I have seen that when push comes to shove women regardless of their cultural linguistic racial and religious differences unite and come together as a gender.

Men have never done that historically and not even now.
Men will still always be divided based on the above mentioned groupings. In fact Men have killed each other over these issues. They have even killed each other over a woman as well.

But I rarely see women fighting and killing each other over a man."

"Man and woman r made differently in nature for existing in harmony by nature,man and woman r different and never can be same❤

"There a lots of cases where a man has been put to jail for several years using the fiminism card and later came to know that the poor guy was wrongly framed.. The lady was at fault.. This Mr. Rathee will never show.. 
Even in our Judiciary, women has been given extra cussion than man.. So, even in our judiciary itself there is no equality then what kind of equality he is talking about.. 
This again he will never show.. 

You can easily identfy his pattern.. He juat shows one side of coin.. 

Here he is opposing Animal but was promiting Gangs of Waaseypur.. What level of hypocrisy is this

Bhai dum hai good job .. nice video first I watched you  on YouTube..
💯 correct
I have changed my mind about feminism after watching this video but there's a video on IG of a girl saying if mens can walk without covering their nipples then women should also have right to walk without bra ..... Does it make sense ?? Plz i wanna know and i support that feminism what dhruv explained.... I was totally wrong about what the feminism is ....
"U r correct. But all thinks already exists in Al Quran.
Study Al Quran and get all answer.  Thanks"
Thing is not about they don't want feminism actually they don't really know the meaning of feminism
Lets just call it humanism or equalism  rather than using term such as feminism or menism
Sir Ted talk wala link send Kar do
Hello dhruv rathi ji kya aap bata sakte hai ki aapne kyu politics per bolna ab kyu chhor diya Thanks ans jarur dena please
Everything dhruv explain is good except man's emotions it will become very hard if man show his emotions and start crying at every incident as no feminist is gonna show sympathy against him until and unless he provide something.

@dhruvrathee  i agree with your view point but you missed a very important point that is discrepency in the laws of the country which itself discriminates between men and women
Best video ...thank u dhruv rathee for such logical explanation about feminism ❤ Some men really will never understand TRUE meaning on feminism
"Feminism is not equality of women along with men, Western civilization is suffering massively from feminism and hook up culture/sexual revolution, feminism started with equal rights but was scam to overpower men, after lowering wage gapes and rising the production, inflation rised and two income household became normal, after women entering workforce, women started more educated and out earning men, women don't need men of their equal they need atleast equal or more more superior, women became more masculine, non agreeable, dominant, carrer oriented with non stay home mom, LGBTQ, men and women are called same in western civilization along with Scandinavian countries but they are the most unhappy, broken marriages, single mother household with fatherless society. Feminism indoctrinates women to be strong and independent without a need of a man. Watch fresh and fit podcast for enlightment."
Women have equal rights but women always misuse their right
Points expressed in this video about male friendships and female friendships don’t make sense at all.
Dalit logo par bhi ek video banao uspe kya jurm hote the 🙃
Any view on Opium Bird.?
"Men have their own duties and Women have their own.
These are two different genders having their own separate duties and rights.
Women should be respected as men and vice versa but mixing both genders by saying ""equal"" is wrong."
Loved This!!!! Really commendable Dhruv Rathee!!!!!!
"For the first time I'm disagreeing with your Opinion/Point of view. Because it's not about logic or patriarchy, it's nature that created us differently for a reason. 
Brother, analyse your logic again. 
Nature sab ko equal rights vala banata to sab ke sab Lesbians ya Gay banke ghumte, humans evolve nhi hote, there are 100s of logical reasons I can give you."

Feminism doesn't follow its own definition 😂😂

So please tell me some rights that men have and women don't have in India
Nonsense. He is beating around the bush and prove nothing.

I appreciate the research you undertake to put forth your point of view.
"Very informative video, but if a woman intentionally wants to keep her husband/father before her and respect them, follow the old traditional ways without feeling oppressed then she is also right and feminism supports that. Yes there are differences which need to be worked upon and make it EUAL for both genders."

"I'm a 16 yr old girl, n I 100% agree with whatever u said. There is a policy made by govn where girls will not have to pay for their eng n medical studies, but boys will have to. Like y ? We all know that they made this policy to get more votes for the elections. Even in public buses we have to pay the cost for half a ticket but men's have to pay for a full ticket. Even this is not r8. We females want equality, not more opportunities than men. Women n men both r not supposed to slap or do any kind of violence with their partners. Thanks, Dhruv Rathee, for explaining this so well without hurting anyone's centiments. The only person I respect after my parents, teachers n other family members is you ❤️"
It is not always about boys throwing acid over girls but girls as well committed these type of crime moreover girl’s family endulge themselves in it so why do girls or women say about such to their family instead Grow up their self and stop asking help then

kuch 4 thi fail aayenge aur wo anpadh hai proof karenge.. 🤣🤣🤣
My friend u have said all the things truth....... But if I disagree with patriarchal society part because without this we cannot exist..... Their should be some boundaries within both men and women...... And men should always be strong as their testosterone makes the reason..... We don't want men to decrease testosterone as nowadays studies shows that men have decreasing testosterone......And remember this todays independent or pendent women both wants strong men....... They don't want weak man who cries and backout on their lives..... You see many studies around it....... So we need men to be strong and masculine not a sissy which creates 🏳️‍🌈👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩👬this.

An extremely important video for the society...

"What about every law that discriminates against gender? Why do not you discuss the numerous laws in our nation that are being abused? Even cricket players and celebrities like Shikhar Dhawan and Muhammad Shami are not safe. What about the law that the present administration passed in the name of feminism? I am in favor of gender equality, but in the name of that cause, society is actually moving quickly toward increasing prejudice and polarization. For example, the alimony legislation was created to safeguard women's futures, but it is currently being abused, and the same is true of other laws passed by the present administration. Generally speaking, these laws do more harm to society than good, as they do not promote equality or harmony."

Biologically, Physically, Mentally, Socially and Constitutionally Male and Female will always be different.

The main issue here is real femists do not speak against matriarchy protraying itself as feminism. There are plenty of classes being conducted in name of feminism but it excludes men to enter the premise and plots against men which now in todays times fake feminist are much more than real feminists

5:52 what makes you think that is not ideal to believe but yours is. Nothing is ideal. Period
My parents are not that educated but I'm proud of them because as a boy I'm told to respect and treat girls equally
"Dhruv there can only be equality among males and females only if the laws are also equal... If a man slaps a woman he can be jailed but if a woman slaps a man no action can be taken ? If a woman cheats the law wont take action against her but if a man cheats he can be jailed for causing adultery. Why does a man has to pay alimony even after getting divorced.. etc etc.. if u want equality then make the laws equal for botb of them why does they get preference? Why there is seat for only women in metros , trains ,bus etc why not for men ? Unless and until laws are equal for both there can be no equality, Alpha male chappri bolo ya kuch bhi bolo ur nonsense agenda wont work everytime."

This video direct slap to every man who is not a feminist. Neha Dhupia didn't say anything wrong in that episode.
It's not about Feminism or Patriarchy. It's about Exploitation of your Rights. No matter If You're a Man or Woman. You're not human if you're misusing your Rights and make someone Suffer.
"15:10 
The man who does express only his negative emotions to his friends shall be considered weak.
Howling or Crying, especially in front of your friends (exception: your time-tested friend) is a sign of weakness for men !
THOSE CRYING MEN ARE WEAK !

I hold such strong opinions as I'd some idea about STOICISM
Men who only cry and shares their Feelings generally focuses on the problem and not on the solution.
We men must be a Rock on whom any closed one in distress can come to us for solution. A rational Man would rather search for the solution rather than the problem as he knows 'cyring wouldn't help him ; crying wouldn't give him solutions ; crying wouldn't change anything'. 
A Man must search for the RAY OF HOPE and not on the darkness he's traped in. It's okay to get a bit demotivated but it mustn't extinguish the Fire of Optimism in us by Crying.

If you are reading this comment :-
Go and Search about STOICISM and ZENO OF CITIUM to truly understand what I mean to say."

Dhruv rathee is the most dumbest person on YouTube istg. Man made a whole video on giving definition but didn't even mentioned about TOXIC femenism nor talked about those toxic shows but made a whole video on animal movie. Liber*ndu😭🤌
"I think god created Man and woman diferently..lolz man is physically stronger, woman is more better to manage and balance house and is the only one who can  reproduce... so when god did not do equalism why do you expect us to be equal.. its not about patriarchy... its d way to happiness.. more stress, depression is happening after woman have chosen to go for career career.. i definitely respect every woman... but if they want to go for career.. ask them if they are ok with house managing husband who do not work... and u will get ur answer..."
I m always criticised for being a feminist. People around me think a feminist woman look down upon a man. How stupid. How can my equal rights disrespect the males?
Bhtreen . ❤❤
Feminism se zyada pseudo feminism is more problematic in our society. Most don't want to take accountability for their actions and try to play the victim card and bash out the opposite gender for literally existing so as to validate their false sense of superiority.
"Adding to what Dhruv described in the video - (1) - There should be ""Mother Name"" as well in all the govt. & legal documents and not just limited to Father Name, as now things have changed. (2) Single motherhood must be embraced, as many unplanned pregnancy cases are there, where a man leaves women but women want to give birth to the child. (3) After marriage, women is supposed to leave their parents and live with in laws. This is also part of patriarchy - This way only in-laws are taken care in old age, what about women's parents who are also getting old. This indirectly increases the ""need"" of having son in the family. I am totally against this culture of leaving ones house and women scrificing living with parents. It is husbands responsibility as well to take care of his in laws, marriage doesn't work one way :)"
No feminist woman would want to have a partner shorter than her. It's reality.
Can u make a proper reply video for asaduddin owaisi recent speech??
The women which are unable to achieve anything in their lives due to whatever reason are patriarchal just because it's in women nature that they're unable to see someone else successful specially if the successful person is same as their gender.
if only feminism was actually what to said Dhruv

"Sir dhruv rathee i am also a feminist i know man and women should be given equal rights but  the current situation of our society women's are not safe so we have to impose some restriction on our women's (mother, sister,and wife) when the society will be good without harming female or when women's feel secure in society then we have to give fully freedom to women's."
Rathee gave me Goosebumps!
Toxic feminine 🔥
Good to see there is still some educated youths in comment section
this video needs to get more views
"As per law and constituency of India, woman has slightly Advantages over men.. Why we need stupid feminism?. Dont tell me feminism is for everyone.. If so why its called feminsm... Every feminist die in cry and pain towards their end life.. Pathetic ending of feminists.. Do not waste your precious time for stupid feminism.."
Very nice 👍
"13:06
What the Buddha said is right. We mustn't counter their slangs with slangs or counter anger with anger.
13:20
But it's not the way either to silently tolerate the abuses given to us. The other side might cause Physical Harm to us or cause harm in terms of our property.
Instead we must consult about the solution of the problem with a calm-head while ignoring the abuses and anger from other side.
Also we must try to calm th other side down to make it focus on the solution rather than the problem to not escelate any form of Physical Abuse

The Fire must be Extinguished with Ice.
We must neither extinguish the Fire with Fire nor to leave it to Combust and to cause harm."

5. Ample evidence,  example, graphics 

6. Effective use of Artificial intelligence.

"Real Feminism means, Women deserve the same salary as Men irrespective of Gender. Women deserve the same opportunity based on their skills and talents. Women deserve the same respect as Men get in the jobs they do. But Modern Feminism means Authority of a Man, Privilege of being a Women But Accountability of a Child.  Which means playing the women card only when it is convenient for them and when it not convenient they will act like a Man."

"Neither Petriarchy nor feminism. Talking about these terminologies itself is creating the gender devide. I used to watch his videos without fail but in recent times he talks just nonsense.
I think whatever is the gender, must be looked at as they are.
And there shouldn't be any equality based on gender. One should get what they deserve based on what they bring to the table not because they are of a certain gender."

If his wife wants to study/work, that's totally fine, as long as she doesn't forego her responsibilities of being the backbone of the household, which would include taking care of children etc. Men provide the house, women provide the home. One cannot exist without the other. One is not less than the other."

Very well discussed Dhruv

Women getting equal rights and opportunities is not wrong. However we see that nowadays women in mass are using feminism when it benefits them and use patriarchal means when it benefits them.

This comment section is literally a Jem. Glad too see many indian youth think like this. Iam tired of seeing 10yr old sigma reels all over Indian server.
"Can Indian traditional cultures maintain their essence without relying on patriarchal beliefs? curious to hear, regardless of gender."
"Yeah
Feminism was never about matriarchy.But nowadays,it is.
Especially in the west.
I have seen thousands of women claiming WE DONT NEED MEN.
Women and men need each other.But it is growing more toxic by each day.
So i wont say i am a feminist.
I prefer gender equality,but not feminism because the idea itself has become very toxic"
Thanks Dhruv for taking up day to day Men's issues !
I'm glad someone talked about the world before her. Everyone should watch that documentary.

"As a 15 year old, I was really confused on my stance because of many misleading videos on YouTube...
Until I watched this video.
The true definition of feminism is what I am with. Gender should never play a role in stuff like what career you do, how much you get paid, etc. What it should depend on is how you are as a person (e.g., your pay should be determined by how productive you are, and no parallels should be drawn with gender in this matter). Thanks dhruv rather for this video"

"This is a ridiculous argument that men and women are equal - not at all. Men and women have different physical structures, ways of thinking, working styles, and power dynamics because God designed men for outdoor work and women for domestic work thus maintaining social balance. Feminism is not about women's rights but about promoting nudity in society. If these feminists advocate for oppressed women, we stand with them But these feminists only want to see women as a decoration piece"
Please make video on Hostel timing. Is it necessary?😊
Love dhruv rathee❤
Nice video
Really helpful dhruv. thanks for uploading such content..
"Men and women 100% should get equal rights, but to be said that they are exact equal and same is wrong imo ,

Don’t you think when a person is engaged in a fight a man can communicate much more rationally than a woman who are often succumbed by emotions and need at least few hours to calm down before talking with their emotions aside.

Also, at times of emergency, whether it be losing your house keys or if a close person to you is having a heart attack infront of you. I believe many women in those situations freezes instead of taking quick actions at those critical hours which is what most men do.

My thinking is not influenced by the society , it comes from experiences. I’ve had few exes in my past where i’ve noticed they can’t talk in senses when situation is heated. And there was one time when a slingbag of ours got lost in a foreign country which held all our passports and important docs, not to forget a horrific memory of my father getting heart attack at 11pm infront of me and my elder sister."

"I would like to add a few more points to this video. 
1. Masculinity is not what These movies show and should face criticism.
2. Toxic feminism exists and is overpowering the true meaning of feminism.  This is why some male criticize women for getting more influenced by these kinds of Bollywood movies. 
3. It's not Gender equality rather it is Gender rights equality. 
4. There are so-called chapri alpha females also whose sole purpose is to hate men. 
5. Man hating is getting so strong under the name of feminism and yet there are no such videos criticizing them. 
I will embrace my musculanity and females should embrace femininity. We both are a very essential part of a society and both should work for the betterment of the society. 👍🏽"
What a great man... Nicely portrait the facts.. thanks man for showing the reality to the world.. you rocks..
"Recently you did a video on feminism but in that you never mentioned regarding ipc laws which are made against men…
I hope you touch upon that topic in future because this a massive issue which no one has the guts to talk about openly"
"The video seems impressive at first glance, and it's nice to hear, but it's quite detached from reality. The idea of equality sounds wonderful until you hit a moment of realization that you've been duped, and there will come a time when you'll find yourself reflecting on it with tears. If simply listening to this person brings you comfort and makes you smile, it's time to step back and question it. That comfort zone is a slippery slope into a world of delusions, distancing you further from the truth. You unwittingly become the ideal target for marketers, transforming into the very product they sell.

Every time you encounter new information, if you just paused to critically analyze it, to sift through it with your own intellect, to research and ponder deeply from various perspectives, you'd shield yourself from the corporate world's hypnotic grasp. If reading this irks you or gets under your skin, it's a sign that the corporate spell has begun its work on you, and you've become ensnared. But once the veil is lifted and you see the reality for what it is, there's no turning back. Stay alert and watch out for these snares."
"EVERYTHING CAN NOT BE ANALYSED AND EXPLAINED ON THE BASIS OF FACTS  ( MOSTLY SOCIAL ISSUES) . YOU SHOULD SEE THE THINGS ON EMOTIONAL LEVEL AND GROUND LEVEL  TOO .

"I swear I've heard a lot of people talking about feminism.  But what Dhruv has told is absolutely true and logical too.  If you understand deeply, he has explained it very well.  But still a lot of people won't understand.  For example, what Neena Gupta has said in the podcast, she just said it.  I did not expect her to say this to women of her age, even though she had already given birth to a child at a young age and raised it alone.  Yet look at her talking like this when I saw this video of her saying this.  Man and woman are not equal.  She too have gone mad.  But now that Dhruv has posted this video, I like it very much, thank you."
I dont hate  equality in women and but in brief  some women are taking feminism in very bad way
"Hi Dhurv, you didn't talk about women use the Law as a weapon to dominate men with false accusation. I think it's time to talk about men abuse by women using unfair advantages of the very law which was made to protect them."
"U mentioned hindu parishad, how come did you not touch Muslim families and their mentality? What about Christian thoughts? Such biasness in your videos are sickening and tiring"
Excellent Dhruv
"Females don't want equal rights in hardworking jobs like sea oil rigs, construction works, special operation soldiers. They want jobs in places like politics or high paying desk jobs. Because they are clearly aware of their physical and mental capablities. They want to earn money for themselves while also want to have a husband who protect them, have higher paying jobs than them, provide for them while also remain loyal to them. A woman can beat a man follow like creep and basically do anything and its called embracing feminism. But the moment the roles are reversed 10 years jail, or big fines are thrown. A woman while physically much weaker than man ,also knowing that she can be easily raped or killed at night still doesn't take husband, brother, or any trustable person along with her. And when she gets raped (which is common) she blames all of men. So there are numerous factors from which it can be concluded that woman being physically and mentally weaker than men want a higher, more powerful and more dominant position over men. (Basically rule and take every advantage (like a pet)). That's what this modern toxic feminism is all about. That's what you supporting for in comment section. And that's what couldn't be cleared in above video properly. If you find any of my sentence wrong or injustified search the same youtube, you will find plenty examples to prove my objective right."
I can only trust on the reviews of Pratik borade Dada..... Most favourite reviewer..... Thappad was not liked by him....

Thank you. Dil ko thandak mil gayi. Nahi toh i was feeling hopeless about the state of India listening to social commentary online.
Ye admi aurat kya hai bhenchod person to person hota hai all the people are not the same but they are equal
Tell me which Indian law does not give equal rights to women ?
The comment section is insane because you can actually see social conditioning here. People don't even realise their half-baked arguments don't make much sense.

"Another excellent video, Dhruv!"
This was eyeopening. Thanks.
"The problem is with the representation of modern wave of feminism. There are a lot of issues here. 
1. Feminism was about equality for both genders , but none of the feminists ever support any of the men's issues. 
2. Feminism has turned into 'As a girl I'll do whatever and society shouldn't judge' . Examples are , cheating , abusing men etc . unfortunately they can get away with it as there are no rules in place for the protection of men. False dowry cases, false sexual abuse cases etc. 
3. Feminism now is literally hating men. Countless activists and social media influencers say outright that they hate men and they should all off themselves. 

Real feminism should be given a different name now because it is ruining the reputation of the term. The power has shifted to the women who care to use them. And ofcourse this all just in big cities and I feminism is actually needed in rural places where women are treated harshly and not whatever today's feminism has turned into."

"भाई, मैं आपका समर्थन नहीं कर रहा हूं, मुझे आपके वीडियो पसंद हैं, महिला भी जहरीली है, आप नहीं जानते लोग सोचते हैं कि आदमी आदमी जहरीला आदमी है, पेट्रोल कुंजी
मैं आपको एक कहानी देता हूं, हर दिन एक दिन आप नौकरी पर जाते हैं, एक दिन आपका समय होता है जब आपने अपनी पत्नी को देखा, यदि आप एक प्रेमिका हैं तो वह दूसरे आदमी के साथ सोती है, आप उससे बात करते हैं, वह कहती है कि हमेशा आपकी गलती है, अगर आप कुछ नहीं हैं तो लोग आपको क्यों सोचते हैं? समलैंगिक यदि आप इस स्थिति में कुछ नहीं कर रहे हैं तो इस स्थिति में आप उसे छोड़ रहे हैं लोग सोचते हैं कि आप समलैंगिक हैं😢😢प्लीज आदमी को भी सपोर्ट करो"
"I understand Dhruv's point of view, given that the sub-continent has a huge problem with female abuse. 

Andrew Tate is a product of the west it is very different here. The issues in the west are very different to the issues in India. India could do with some dose of feminism. The west is literally overdosing on extreme feminism identity politics and LGBTQ. Which is extremely harmful to society."

Our own constitution supports toxic feminism.. What to day
"Correct me if I'm wrong Dhruv is that feminism actually practised? That's what feminism might be but It doesn't run like that. I can't say much on everyday  India but overall around the world sadly they apply the opposite. A women gets favoured just based on her gender and everyone believes her based on her gender. Not men. Men are always ignored and sidelined in majority of cases which then makes them turn to the chapri style(unacceptable btw). Most men now literally feel threatened by women as if they say anything that she don't agree with, you are done for big time in society. Men problems will go on sadly as the women are attracted always to the latter. Nice guys finish last sadly. Feminism of the 90s is actually what makes sense to me but now, this feminism is more of an anti-men movement as these girls can't even define the word  ""misogyny"" when asked upfront."
Dhruv Bhai singlehandedly destroyed alpha chigma bois🔥
"Good video. I also hope you would have talked about illogical and problematic laws against men in India. That is a big big issue. However, this video is good for how much it explains."
"WESTERN perspective about women and INDIAN perspective about women are different. 
Women in western countries are less happy as compared to Indian women and that is because of our culture.

Do not try to mix it 

MAN ARE COMPLETE WITH WOMEN AND WOMEN ARE COMPLETE WITH MEN.

Partner itself means completing each other ,filling each other void.She do things which I can't do AND I do something she can't do and that's why we are life partner.

IF MEN AND WOMEN ARE SAME REMOVE THE CATEGORY FOR MEN AND WOMEN. 
CONSIDER A NEW ONE ""HUMAN"" IN EVERY THING IN LIFE.

MEN are good in physical activity and WOMEN are good mental activity. We should embrace each other strength and fill each other weakness.

AGAIN MEN AND WOMEN ARE ""equal"" NOT ""same""."

Please  make one vidio about explaining  why Indians r being targeted  in USA  ?
please make a video on jee mains percentile system😢 ❤
He is very basic
You have my respect but somewhere these feminist girls never settle for unemployed men nor did it ever liberate any male from the patriarchal things u said... Not height not salary... Every girl who is educated and is feminist is never settling with a low salary short guy they still want that and the rights... And also really sorry but u forgot how feminism is used to actually torcher males using laws only... So please if u are serious... Make a video highlighting where feminism succeeded and where it miserably failed and turned misandry... If u can criticize those misogynistic films criticize misandry songs of Taylor Swift... Also none of the feminist page ever talks about why suicide rates are higher in males or about the false accusations stuff and wrong child support things... See these are logical things which I want u to really answer if u are trye feminist and if it's really good. Also when there is a criticism for misandry things like lyrics of Taylor Swift... They always say u are getting jealous as female is getting on top and not males... So where did this logic come from? Means using misandry and getting on top doesn't give u any right to do that stuff... Its wrong condem it... And of true feminism society went too ahead in many terms now crushing males... Specially the laws... Name any one law a female doesn't have which male has... And please talk about the special things that in today's world also a rape can be done only by males and not females... There's no protection for men in laws... Also how still books like how to control ur husband like a dog are selling freely and vice versa is critised heavily... I don't say feminist support such wrong things but they don't even do anything against it... So somewhere ur point that feminism is for males is just a crap

"सिर्फ हिन्दू धर्म में ही महिलाओं पर कई प्रतिबंध हैं, ऐसा नहीं है.. बल्कि इस्लाम धर्म में तो महिलाओं को बुर्का पहनने के लिए बचपन से मजबूर किया जाता है, और इस्लाम धर्म में तो महिलाओं को शरिया कानून के तहत कई तरह की क्रुरतम सजा दी जाती है।"

The actual problem is the womens  which are involved in spreading FEMINISM out of that suppose in a data a rough data according to me out of 10. 6 womens want feminism just bcoz they want to enjoy their life. Like a man according to them. Enjoying late night parties and many. THE ACTUAL PROBLEM IS FACED BY THAT 4 GIRLS hope so the ratio will never increased 🙏
I AM A FEMINIST 👍

3 - Wo Lucknow wala matter (Wo ladki chapri hai ya nahi?)

Aapki puri video me chhapri or let down karne jaise words sirf ladko ke liye hi use kare hai … kaafi kuch or bhi bolna hai … lekin mai job par hu or break me ye video dekh raha tha … ab ladka hu to kamana bhi zaroori hai warna wahi ladkiya izzat nahi dengi bhale wo ghar ki ho ya samaaj ki … to jaata hu … message dikhe to sochna ek baar reply nahi chahiye ✌🏻"

"Hey man you're right about feminism but ,,,,, ....
i know my comment won't effect so just leave it."
"The reason for dragging the term feminism in such cases like Neha dhupia's is the fake feminism... Bollywood and girls nowadays believe that feminism gives them permission to drink alcohol, consume drugs, do late night parties, wear too short clothes, slap men and have sex with more than one man (one night stand also)... This is what is being considered as feminism to most of the women, and in the retaliation of this, alpha men are dragging and criticizing feminism so much nowadays... Fake feminism needs to be stopped, that's the only way to finish patriarchy..."

I don't believe in men women equality; men women can never be equal rather I believe in justice that is men get their rights and women get their rights in the society...
"We need men like Andrew Tate ✅✅✅..
Not like Dhruv Rathee ❌"
"Ask a feminist woman to apply for a job in coal mine , or a iron ore extraction unit, or high tension line repair job. Why in the world feminist looks a supervisor job in an IT department or a software company. Really no body is preventing any girls to apply for a mining job . Answer is simple equal opportunity can be given to everyone , not equality. I am not in favor of patriarchy but I don’t think destroying the mom + dad and kids family will be a very progressive idea. I will also encourage you to visit different industries and universities take a statistical look on how many women apply for what kind of jobs and do graduations in what field of study. Women and men are different biologically and that’s why we have a society to begin with."
"I agree with every point of yours 
But, you should make a video on how some women misuse the constitution to their benefit
Like those divorce, consent type cases 
It is imp for everyone to know that how some women are destroying male rights and lives too"
"I'm a feminist but not a pseudo feminist.
There are many tasks that a man can easily do and there are some tasks a woman can easily do.
Yeah as per the definition of feminism:-
""Feminism is the belief that women deserve equal social, economic, and political rights and freedoms.""
I agree with that but i believe all tasks cannot be done by men and all tasks cannot be done by women that's why they are different.
I do respect all females and i also support higher education of all females.
But i hate those pseudo feminists who say ""all men are dog"" or ""world will be better without men"" or ""a woman can do whatever a man can do""
Or ""we dont want men for living"".
Also i hate patriarchy as well because in a society as woman should be respected just like an other man. 
Thanks Dhruv Rathee For Clarifying The Concept."
Very informative and interesting program thanks for sharing the knowledge 👍
"Thank you for summarizing your research and inspiring others to do their own research to learn more by providing the references.
Clarity on the definition of feminism is one thing but mindset of equality is a whole new story. By knowing the definition , alfa males will not change or will not stop tagging 'equal' females as feminist. Nowadays, the word feminist is used to tag certain women's who try or does thing's equally or better than men's. So they will use a different word now.
The mindset needs to change and it's a long process. I wonder why alfa males still talk about alfa males supiority when they work under women's in almost everywhere. So funny."
Ja n Bhai mtlb kch bhi. 😅😅😅
The ultimate solution to this? -ISLAM✨🕋
Video for Feminism ❌Video to save Masculinity ✅
"The Problem with Subcontinent Feminism is the it only call for equal rights but not for equal responsibilities. Here in the video Dhruv pointed few cases where Men were at the receiving end & He simply said No Feminists supported the women acts,  That's is the hypocrisy, when these Pseudo feminists call for crimes against women, they not only criticize but demand punishment where as in crimes against men you'll find no condemnation from any feminists. One can't get away with this by simply saying no feminist supported it,  All must display same behavior for crimes and wrongdoings. So this hypocrisy must end, only then feminists will look true in their demands."
"I think you forgot 1 thing to mention:
What about the marketing campaign that shows that, women should look like this and men should like this
what about those campaigns, which shows that make up is only for women, infact women must do make up
There are many more things in this: just getting equal rights is not the solution. equality should be our inherent nature and equality means for all.
People who actually belives in equality, should promote their thoughts but not to gain popularity or promote films like some celebrities do."
"But what about the laws against men? ....... 
What you just explained it's seemed like a beautiful theory. The reality feels different........"
Apne video me dunu ko balance kia  bohot acha laga.
So well explained! I am glad we have men like you. ✨
Most women i know doesn’t know what these terms even mean but end up bringing into the conversation . What the recent generation failed to understand is the essence of feminism actually is. Ignorance is the main reason for superficial feminism which unfortunately has become quite rampant.
😂😂😂😂
❤❤
Clear hai boss
Much needed video :)
😌
"1. No sane man is a feminist. Feminism is no longer about equal rights but it is man hating and giving one sided unfair advantage to females, in law and in society.
2. This simp doesn't know what he is talking about. He has been conditioned by toxic feminism where men are blamed for their own problems and the problems of women. Women are not be blamed for anything but just praised for everything."
Very well portrayed and good insights here. But let's not forget the facts that nowadays Feminism is being misused as a Tool or weapon. If its really about Equal rights for both genders why give a name which is gender specific.
Ye height bala example to mera de diya 5 6 😂
That's what Andrew tate has been saying so long and you idiots don't care to hear him or understand him

Patriarchy k definition me kahi par ye nahi likha hai ki “aadmi ka control hona auraton k upar” galat interpretation dene ki ky zarurat hai. Very disappointed. Literally my brain is hurting. He talks so idealistically. Reality doesn't care about these things. There are reasons for the way things are in this world. So now you can't even punch someone if someone humiliates you in front of your wife. Meaning you don't have dignity. What kind of cuckster pussy advice is that. Tu hi kar bhai apni gf yaa biwi ko tolerate unke cheat krne pe. Bohot se ladke h jinka abhi bhi dimaag thikane pe h jo apni partner k cheating ko tolerate nhi krenge or jo ki sahi bhi h. You are clearly promoting the matrix agenda here men should cry more. They should act on their feelings. that's why you get rapists and acid attackers because men who are vulnerable to their emotions who can't control their emotions are dangerous to society and that's a fact. These kinds of videos are cancer for our society. Pin of shame 📍
Kya be mulle kaisa hai bahoot dino baad milraha hai. Kaha thaa itne din
"This video seems a lot misleading....women have more or less the same rights as men, in the nation, and the patriarchy is not the problem... Men have built all the roads, buildings, infrastructure, etc  and all the difficult and dangerous jobs are occupied by mostly men, and when divorce happens who benefits more financially women or men??😂 then where are feminists?? and lastly  women are biologically attracted to men who are somewhat better than them, height, strength, competence, confidence, etc nobody gives importance to a shy, coward, vulnerable guy, it is not that men can't cry or have emotions, but if men are overly emotional, and too sensitive in several situations it can be a deal breaker in several relationships, men and women are not the same, they are not equal when see holistically , targeting the patriarchy and telling women can be equal to men is not needed...."
Dhruv Bhaiya's T-shirt is changed now!
You are right Niha dupia and rich girl with cab driver both cases didn't get spot from feminism. But feminism is quit on these matters. But if againt girl some thing happened they speak load that its wrong. Double standards
5:16 these things dont happen nowadays in middle class family.
He explained everything so well. Hope every male and female understands the real meaning of feminism and support it.

"i think one point missing pls provide some rights for men on fake rape case, dowery and make divorce process fast because now days womens misuse this law for money. so providing equal rights for men in this law to save men life if you are true femnist you support equilty."
"Equality of opportunity is ok but equality of outcome is totally unfair ,  we in india have separate reservations for women , in jobs educations etc we have reserved seats in public transport even free transport , we have women centric law in this country where women shamelessly abuse it almost 74 rape cases were false last year almost 98% of domestic dowry and abuse cases were false many  have committed suicide due to it their family also suffer , but this point is suppressed in the world from many years even dhruv didn't cover it 😂

Solution : 
1) remove all reservations 
2) bring equal centric laws
3)stop alimony dahej dowry 
4) Stop forcing women empowerment agenda in our throats every where for eg ( movies for eg she hulk , four more shots ) let people enjoy things the way they are not everything is needed to be about women
+ 
Why do we need feminism in 2023
1) women have more rights and opportunities than men 
2) gender pay gap is debunked thousands of time"

its easy to say things in front of few cameras insider a studio i will never support the 5 percentage ri8 things to do 95 percentage wrong results i also want equal rights fir women but for those who deserve these right... it is more necessary for girls than boys that to know what is the feminist.. not for women u need some crazy fuking guys who always ...ready to protect there motherlands you can't eliminate the animals of this society this video is ..one if my lowest rank video of your ...i support every equal ri8 for every living being not only for female but its is necessary to understand what is real feminism not to misuse it . the reason of all' problem is not men ...

"Unfortunately when your religion is not the right one, only then you will follow the western concepts like Feminism or any isms. Islam solves this gender issues beautifully with biological and natural instincts."
99% women don't want unemployed men to marry ...this is truth not patriarchal thought I think
"Our main stream media is senseless ethic less along wid rising unemployment makes the migration of rural areas people town tier 3 tier 2 cities 
 females & males migrate to metro cities where they act like animals those males who r sincere check the complete background of female  before getting married bcoz these days I have seen so many reports that males & females from  mostly in age 13 to 30 they just busy in taking gifts money food articles & physical intercourse only before marriage no loyalty towards any one they change boyfrnds or partners like clothes so don't send males & females outside your area unless very necessary
And get a female as ur wife who has a character & loyalty
Adultry has become a common phenomenon in India & Asia so talking about culture is waste   marriage is no longer a pious thing it's just an agreement which legislature have to pass in UCC but females while making a boyfrnd live in partner or getting married choose a wise prudent man not only Money & physical attraction that will lead to tarnish lives other Thing this generation have to understand the Loyalty is most important factor of Life"
Is tarah k topics aur kaun bana sakta hai
"3:36 farhan akhtar and Per say amirr khan have done so much for feminism in India, you should have given them a little more detail in the video rather giving Satanic arsehole any time. This is what Muslims have done for India and did in past as well!"

"Haha! I must admit that you are a very intelligent person. You know exactly how to make people believe the things that you think are right. I couldn't agree more on the real definition of feminism that you described and explained. BUT your entire video was only for ""chapri alpha males""! Not even once you called ""chapri psuedo feminist"" and explained them what true feminism is! Your video does not qualify the basic term of feminism which is equality! You failed to hide your emotions, to be specific, your hatred towards men. Ive been such a huge supporter of you, I admired you so much (still do in other topics) but this time, nah you proved that even you can be socially conditioned. Be a real feminist, Dhruv. You're still not there yet."
Equal rights does not mean equal pay.
Plzz make a video about Sondeshkhali and current situation of West Bengal 🙏 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Seriously yar… nice topic…… bahut achha bataya or samjhaya apne
"Honestly I don't agree with a lot of his points. But I WILL say one thing, I live by the motto ""You get what you deserve""

यहाँ pe भी तुमने हर चीज मे आदमी को ही दोषी माना है 👎👎👎... Shame on you
Dhruv please make a vedio on introverts..
"Everything you said at last was right and I do support equality in every aspect but the thing is feminist people will be silent on such issues where there is a misuse of  power of feminism ...(the examples you gave at last ) .... But they will be more vocal and raise their voices when there's a men's fault .... That's why we believe it's a fake feminism....no doubt none of the feminist supported neha dhupia ....but neither they came forward to say that she was Hippocrate .... Is this what we call feminist equality......
There are many cases of using word feminism to do whatever the girl wants to may it be wrong than the actual cause of feminism.......petriyarcal is a problem of small town and villages now a days and feminism is a problem of the cities ....."
Dhruv bhai yeh bhi bta dete ki marital affair or hr jgah apni taahge(legs) felana koi feminist nahi hai.bl ki prostitution hai nhi toh aj kl feminist husband ko bhi keh deti hai (my body my choice)
Aur nahi feminism khatm hogi
on social media in the name of feminist they spread hate towards men instead of equality's
You explain so well i can relate and understand thank you. You can change the world.
"I respected feminism when they used to be about getting equal opportunities as men 
But Modern day feminism is just a joke 😂"

Just to say 🔥🫡
As Muslim we always should follow Hazarat Muhammad (sa) and holy Quran
"Keep up the good work, buddy. We need more brains like yours. I consider your videos as revolutionary - instilling growth mindset with peacefulness in people."
"Even though it is true that some guys misuse the word feminism, it is also true that its mostly women who use feminism as a tool to do whatever the please or defame whomever they want"
Female has many advantages over male
Hi make a video on ecleotral bond please
"What a stupid example of giving right of voting to a normal man and a disabled person...... I agree only if you say everyone should be given his own rights (justice)...... the philosophy of equal right has no sense because everybody deserve separate rights and implementing equal rights means injustice with the right of another person... It could be understand by your own example of giving right of voting, would you allow a child to cast his vote before 18??? If not then kindly say why you are making inequality between him and others? Obviously your answer will be like ' the child has no right for casting vote until he reaches 18 and here it becomes more obvious that the concept of equality is totally wrong we should replace it with the concept of justice, so where there is justice there  you wouldn't need to beg for your rights....."
"That's the point . I support feminism, but why are they giving blind reservation to female on the name of feminism . 8 out of 10 medical post graduates are female . Ham ladke kahan jayenge 😤😤"
"the problem is those feminist don't condemn these act, they go mute. Its selective approach thats hurt."
"if people will get true education { academical + physical + social }, it will be helpful for better society , no. of chapris will be lesser"
"this is the first time dhruv made  useless video,proudly being misogynist."

I am 17 year old girl....and i totally support this creator Dhruv Rathee... And I am a feminist...in this video a very complex topic is explained in very simple way .... The world is full of negativity in this ocean of negative environment where the other creators use the word feminist word for just click paid thumbnail... And spread a negative meaning against feminism... Thankyou Dhruv Rathi for explaining such a complex topic of feminism in a very simple way....and also educating people about this.....
"First 17 seconds in, and I want to tell you that nobody watches feminist films, so no it's not dangerous for the society."
"aajkal feminism par filme ban rahi hai vo bhi aisi jisame ak aourat bahot se mardo ke saath physical hoti hai, to kya feminist ka matlab yahi hai movie ka name (Dolly Kitty Aur Woh Chamakte Sitare) aaj saher ki ladkiya itani jyada bigad chuki hai ki vo ak saath 6, 7 boyfriend rakhti hai kya yehi feminism hai , such to ye hai ki maximum ladkiya kaam karna hi nahi chahati , aour jinake pass job hai unako shirf apna paisa dikhta hai maximum sabhi nahi..... agar itani hi feminist banti hai ye ldkiya to kahi bhi dekh lo koi ak ladki jisake pass job hai kya vo ak berojgaar ladke se shadi karegi?  no never.. par maximum ladake jinake pass job hoti hai vo jobless ladkiyo se shadi karte hai... harmesha se yahi hota hai ki ladkiya boyfriend banati hai aour kisi pisewale se shadi karke unka kaam ho jata hai,,, kabhi socha hai un ladko ka kya hota hoga... aour yaha mai fu....# Boyes ki baat nahi kar raha hu"
Dhruv waiting for your famers protest video 😢 want to know the whole thing pls make a video on it.🙏🏻
the problem about feminism is that most of the feminists in today's world are all hypocrites and play the feminism card according to their convenience and support patriarchal thought process whenever it suits their narrative.
Kia hee explanations hai
"In Islam, men and women are equals. Their rights are respected equally. Like two stars shining brightly in the sky, they stand together, side by side. In Islam, there is no difference between them"
"विदेशी राइटर के बुक पढ़ के देसी लोगों के बीच ज्ञान बांट के अपने आप को समझदार दिखाने की कोशिश करना एक तरह की बेवकूफी ही होती है

😂
Nature does make hierarchy auntyji
Taking about hipocracy is not what u are doing same in the video  not talking about Matriarchy more as your patrarcial thinking in the way as in the near future the contend is judge by someone and u might have to give apology. And the reason the people dont like femisim is not the reason u justyfy its just lack of education between the matrarcy and feminin society . Education is the basic needed to mantain the equality . Neither matrarchy nor the patriarchy taking your contend for 1st time and not taking it again .  Reason u create contend dont provide education. And if u think critisizing the other work to gain view do u know what it is called exploitation. crater who wanna me alpha like those owls out there
great explanation

Amir khan and farahan akhtar as the example of feminist 😂😂
Something missing in this video
"First thing, things don't work with emotions and the second thing you can't compare oranges with apples, i know the example you've taken like Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Savitribai Phule they seriously fought for women's empowerment but nowadays things have changed feminism in the ground level i.e. women>>men, even if you're undeserving women you will be priorities before deserving man just for the sake of your so-called DEI(diversity, equity, and inclusion) be it on the job, college everything nowadays even in the army there is reservation for a woman means your so-called equality should be more important than national security isn't it will be unfair for the men why no one is talking about this?, I can talk about this topic all day but in conclusion i can say the way we're heading, feminism hasn't destroyed the society yet but gradually it is damaging."

Well name of feminist should be changed to anything else and everyone will support it😅
"I have no issues with equal rights to women. It should be given. But what about where discrimination with boy occur?
Eg:-1) if I passed 10th or 12th,Bsc exam in bihar as a boy I didn't get a single rupee but girls get upto ₹50,000.
2) In nursing job for girls 80% reserved. Isn't this discrimination?
3) Many places like Delhi travel for  girls free isn't this discrimination, is not possible to make free travel for boys also.
   Hope you explain about this issue also."
Metro ka ladies compartment ki bhi baat karlo jab itni hi equality hai to 🤡
"Men and women are not comparable when it comes to evolutionary roles, i.e.(1000 years back) one is designed to protect the family and bring food for the family, while the other's role is to take care of the house and nurture the kids. 

But considering the present scenario, where we live in a world so advanced, ( Food and shelter is not even a point of concern for the majority population) there is a problem our evolution has no answer to. Now the differentiating trait of a man ( Being strong & backbone of the family) is no use.

Any activity/role/function should be first analysed if it can be done by a man or woman. If the answer is yes then both should be considered equal without discrimination. 


Equality for a job, which considers both sex equal."
Was a muchh needed video
Respect button 👏 👌 🙌
There is an extremely thin line between Feminism and Patriarchy.  Most women these days have already crossed that line.  Values have changed and it will not be surprising when we will slowly but steadily be heading towards the Matriarchal society.

Generalisation is a big problem.
"When feminism does not explicitly oppose racism, and when anti-racism does not incorporate opposition to patriarchy, race and gender politics often end up being antagonistic to each other, and both interests lose."
I am not patriarchal but somewhere feminism is also not good
"That means, most of the feminist don't understand feminism😂"
"Patriarchy to padri, mulla ya pandit hota hai na, isme purush pardhan kese huwa"
"When Indian men are not even allowed to file a case of domestic violence or sexual harassment, how can I believe that feminism is for equality?? Where are the feminists campaigning for men's right to protection against something as basic as domestic violence? 
When the government tried to make the rape and sexual harassment laws gender-neutral, it was the Indian feminist who prevented the government from doing so."
"Aaj kal k bollywood actress ladkyon ko yeh  batati hai ki feminism ka mtlb hai ki, ladkiyan bahar jao, independence k naam pe char jaga muh maro apni value down karo, phir batao ki its my choice, cant accept my past, itna judgemental kaise ho.... And kuch p*ssy admi bhi ye support karte hai ki this is what feminism called"

"The statement men and women can be equal is fundamentally wrong. There can be equity among men and women, but never equality. Dhruv very cleverly equated the anatomy of both the genders, but what about the physiology ? 
There are several fundamental differences in the biology of men and women which enables them for functions specific to their gender. Men and women have evolved differently to fulfill different purposes, otherwise they would have been the same organism. 

Atlast women empowerment should never go against the order of the nature. Otherwise The catastrophe can already be seen in the society."
Men and women are equal in aggregate and own their responsibility. This is a very complex topic.

"Today i broke up with my loved ones,the reason was feminist,he didn't want me to do study n do job,coz i am a girl or hme sirf ghar k kaam karna chahiye or wo jo kahe bass usme bass haa milao or uspe koi question na kro ,ye kaise sahi ho sakta,human ko bass ek human k tarah treat kro , phir koi jhagre nhi honge ,at the end i called him narrow minded person, or i guess most of the cases me divorce v isiliye hote h ....but i really miss him 🥺 n i am stuck in a situation ki jo maine kiya wo sahi tha ya nhi , can anyone help me to get out of this..."

"No Dhruv
I have heard Neena Gupta's video. She was complaining that women are not equal in our society"
Does Indians deserve Dhru Rathee ???...dhruv is an evolved human being. We all should strive to achieve that. Congrats dhruv you just outdid yourself.
"Any women would speak about this, but a man speaking about this issue and clarifying it, is really impressive. U proved that it is the body that has gender,  soul doesn't have any gender.....but why always people like you are very few?"
U have made a balance video and highlights good points and views. I wanted to know ur and others view on one insta video I saw in which a person was saying that men normally outsource his parents responsibility to his wife. What's ur say on it?
I am not feminist but the advocator of women's right.
i respect Dhruv's opinion but still society is not equal and boys also face discrimination in many places......even in school all the teachers have a soft corner for girls.....I know that girls still face discrimination and all i want to say is that our society is not going on the right path.....
This is jungly culture coming to destroy the pure culture of india
thanks dhruvv rathhee for educating indian audience about patriarchy i am shocked how many men hate on feminism
"If a girl doesn't want to marry an unemployed man, it's her choice.

People pretend to be feminist but actually most of them are fake feminist.

They just want to exploit women in the name of feminist or equality

Men and women are not same physically and emotionally too

God has created them different and blessed men and women with their different powers.

The real feminism is when a men and women works according to their ability and capabilities.

I wish every people came to know this.
And stop exploiting ladies in the name of equality."

Kuch nahi raha abh ye sabh
i love this man.
Thank you for giving me a topic for my speech 🙃
"It’s not about ""Equal Right"". Rather it should have been ""Appropriate Rights"". 

For example: Suppose only one chair available in a waiting lounge and 3 people are demanding the chair. One of them is lame & the other two are fit & fine. Now who is more eligible for sitting in it?

Equal Right: Everyone has equal right to sit there.

Appropriate Right: The lame should be given the chair.

By the way, to the so called faminists, if it is appropiate to have paid maternal leave, what wrong the father did. He also should have paternal leave, no matter the company gets busted. After all equal rights matters."
Thank you so much dhruv sir for amazing video🙏💐💛✨
Good 1
Great👍
Appreciate you
"This video is very much important because nowadays many ideologies are criticised without knowing their actual meaning. This is helpful for the youth. 
Your videos are very helpful, knowledgeable, appreciative and hats off for the content. Out of this much content on YouTube there are many less youtubers who are actually influencing us in the right direction. You are one of them and it feels good to see that many are now trying to choose the right direction. Being a student, teenager and a HUMAN I am honoured to see this type of content which is actually good. I always feel inquisitive to watch your videos."

"It is said that to a hammer everything looks like nail. To the imbecilic narrator of this video everything that is distasteful is ""patriarchy"". This channel is perfect for impressionable teenagers to feel good about themselves. The narrator reduced everything to the definition, rather than, actions of political ideology that is feminism. Feminism is a Marxist adjacent ideology that purports that human history must be seen from the perspective of battle between sexes (where men were oppressors and women were oppressed). 

If it was only about equality then it would have been a redundant ideology because the concept liberty and equality predates feminism by centuries. Feminists seek power. They claim that every disparity at powerful places were caused by discrimination. One would find feminist clamouring about number of women in board rooms but they are conspicuously silent about any and all fields where women outnumber men."
Ye ab tak ki sabse achhi informative video lagi ❤I will be share dil se salute bhiya 😢

"Hey! Dhurv  one question. 
I'm your regular viewer. I really like your videos. Keep growing 🙌
What is the meaning of the 'chapri' word that u use regularly on your videos?"
Are u a feminist btw big fan
"Make a video (as many as possible) about US, UK, USSR, China.
And separately worlds biggest entertainers WWE, The Rock, Wrestlemania etc."
I strongly believe that if one is doing something for the section of vulnerable female to restore their rights they are actually whom we call feminist...

"Every single men around me are so full of patriarchal thoughts including my family and friends. On top of that, women are also like that. Recently i was very down and depressed about this. Its highly appreciated to make such eye opener videos. Calling those alpha sigma males ' chappri influencers' is the best reply to them. I dont know how difficult is it to have  respect for one another in this world. Its such a simple thing to do. Anyways, i am happy to see a man creating such video. Else people nowadays just know to bash women for their feminist ideas while chasing those very women at the same time."

Good topic to choose. Any chance you will talk about the land of liberals - West Bengal. How wonderfully the administration has gagged the evil women of sandeshkali who were bjp supporters that spoke ill of a poor Muslim man…
Great video.. 🫰
Topic kuch aur puri video kuch aur😂.. time waste or diya is baar
"Agreed to the most part of your views on feminism .. But it would have been great if u have also discussed more about FemiNAZIs in here .. "" a situation where a woman takes disadvantages of her being a woman"" .. I will give you an example... The case of Jasleen and Sarabhjeet.. where that girl accused the boy of harrasment... But in the end it turned to be a false implications ... While the social media trial was going on.. everyone ( politician like Kejriwal, actress like Sonakshi) publically praised that girl and shamed the boy...  They boy got terminated from his job and was called rapist... While the girl after realising she is going to loose I'm the court happily got settled in Canada... And didn't attend any hearing in court ...!! Now today the case is been ruled in favour of the boy .. but he lost his 11 years and had suicidal thoughts during that period .. 


My point being... If toxic masculinity is a problem...  Then femiNAZIS need to be viewed in the same lens...

Hope I made sense...


Thanking you to make me understand the meaning of Feminism... And iam proud feminist!!!"

donot reply just keep it mind."
Some of your points irrelevant according to me but I agree with some points
"75 percent of the r@pe cases in India are false
80 percent of domestic violence in India are false
As per section 69 BNS only a man can be arrested even if it was mutual relation 
77 percent of Indian women have extra marital affairs
Yas bro feminism is doing so much for society 🤡
This guy is supporting Feminism coz he's a puppet or we can say a s€# doll of his wife who spend times with other men while he records his video 🤡"
"As a 16 year boy I support this video
This is one of the best video of druve sir"
"Patriarchy is the overall system on which our societal norms and stereotypes are based. The  patriarchy system  is what defines muscularity and femininity .  Patriarchy tells us that masculine people should be strong ,they should not cry and be ready to do anything that is deemed feminine and most importantly masculine people shouldn't be feminine at all . Then it tells us conversely that feminine people are overly emotional ,that they cannot be part of masculine realms .They're dramatic  because of their gender but opposite of masculine people feminine people are always  there to support masculine people either as mother ,sister wife or uterus . We're taught that  being masculine is good and and  desirable while being  feminine is enforcement  


Example that shows the patriarchy existing in our society is "" society blaming girls for wearing short or comfortable clothes"" and another example is ""world making fun of the guy who cries"" but 80% of suicide are done by guys so, to make society Happy we need to realise that feminism is beneficial for man too but a lot of people think feminism is hating men but   feminism is about taking down patriarchy and it's oppressive norms ,Even though men are the one who benefit from patriarchy the most yet they are  victimised to an extend. I mean ""it's like misogyny  being a two way street"" . The definition of masculine doesn't allow men  to share feelings so  they end up bottling up their emotions . They have no way to seek help for and they don't know how to deal with emotions .Society labels showing emotion or tears as feminin things.


 undoubtedly the patriarchy system is a system in  which  men hold the power and  women are largely excluded but still patriarchy oppresses all of us."
Sir make video on FARMER PROTEST in India 🎉

Women and children could leave the country.
Why men were not allowed. 
Bhai ye Faminism ki baat jab tak conditions normal h na tab tak karlo. 
Jaise hi adverse conditions aati h everyone gets back to its basic goals."
why you have still not uploaded a video about FARMERS PROTEST.
what are these AI generated videos? these looks terrible.
"Motive of the story: Before using any English word, please understand its meaning first."
"Waataa content... Absolutely amazing...The way you explained and present through the examples is extremely impactful and this is the reality that needs to be understood by the indian conservative mindsets. 
Where you should understand the definition of the words and behave likewise.

But, unfortunately more often we see, watch and experience is...
People's words do not match their actions.

I really appreciate this.
So much to learn.
Thanks a lot for sharing."

As usual dhruv again bought up only hindu societal issues but not other major religion. Which shows his hypocrisy
I am not feminist but every month I give my total salary to my wife and it's in expenses my wife's wishes more than me. India.
Feminism is not just for females but it's for men also...

Dhruv bhaiya please make next video on # Osho ❤
"In Islam it's just the same as u taught in the video and hence if u read and learn about the rights of women (that are limited and not like doing harem things) but the jobs that are good for women and provide security to women like docs, engineers, teachers and many more...

btw nice video...."
"ohhh my god man you just read our minds, u said that if we imagine a jobless person, I really imagined a jobless boy I can't understand it but how and u said that spending wife's money yes, it's a real truth about Indian society that men should work, and women should spend the income. wow I was so amazed by your video, but I know u will not read these comments, but I just expressed my feelings."

Dhruv rathee is a bluepill guy ( I'm retarted )
"everyone complains about patriarchy but no one understand how it got established and it's true meaning
men and women are not equal but similar we have been given different strength and weaknesses to perform different things and work together feminism can only exist in soft times like now think about it"

Ok finally a worthy video about feminism.
"The problem is with people who have disgraced the meaning of feminism 
The literal meaning is and actual meaning of feminism is very different today"

"Feminism and idiot are synonyms of each other, you can either be a feminist (idiot), or stand for equality as per the Constitution."

"Chapri is a casteist and classiest slur. You are showing your classiest mentally behind Feminism. That's not a progressive thing. You are constantly using the same slur. Chapri is only used for poor people, but patriarchy has no financial barrier, there rich and educated people who are more patriarchal than poor people. So stop your double standard."
Male crying about their mental health not being take seriously and then supporting patriarchy 🤣🤣🤣
great content
"Agreed! I’m a feminist but the 4th wave of feminism is not about equality but trashing men and leaving out all the things that are not convenient for women such as Equal contribution to finances , body shaming of men ,impartial laws etc."

"12:44 to 13:18, Wow Sir! I am amazed by this, such a true Dhruv Rathee Example!"
"Sir Dhruv's definition of chapri is different😅
Maybe alpha male only😅"
"In India, gender equality is the biggest joke... I don't have any problem with the pure form of feminism... but I am against fake or toxic feminism... some woman unethically uses the laws of Indian constitution for their advantage which mostly protect women. Nowadays women are using these laws and file fake rape cases ,fake dowry cases and other cases against men and men are helpless in this case."
"Sir आप बहुत अच्छा से समझते हैं,और हर एक प्वाइंट को अच्छे से cover करते हैं।Thank you Dhruv rathi sir.God bless you all group members 💐💐🌹🌹🥰🥰"
its kinda sad ke itne sare real issues hain aur log feminism pe atk rkhe hain
"One more thing you forgot if feminism happens then people would see girls as equsl to males 
And then all the religion based hate would also stop 
Where muslims hate non muslims when non muslim majorly hindu and Christian guy marry Muslim girl 
And hindu christian hate when muslim marry hindu christian girl...
So this problem would also solve 
If male dominance gets ended 
We jst need to make sure that both males and females continue lineage by giving one child surname of father and other child with mother surname....
It would make sure that both are equally continuing lineage 
( The point where patriarchy started would rupture )"
Thank you Brother
You r truly fabulous bhaiya❤
"Feminists talking about equality should be asked about their contribution in in building the infrastructure and things they use like roads, buildings, bridges, electricity, food, gadget etc... they will shut the mouth and vanish instantly...
All they want is high position in companys built by men.

But equal pay should be paid to equal work. Every job should be open for everyone irrespective of gender. Equal rights should be given to everyone irrespective of gender. Also working women should take responsibility of her family expenditure, instead of saving all their wages and expecting men to work and spend for their family expenditure."

"Now I can proudly say that ""I'm a feminist '"
Remember my ethics and values book
Wikipedia youtuber talking about women right 😂😂😂my 🦶
2:55 This blasphemous is not a legendary author rather he is very bias and has errors in his writings...
There is another problem in society that if a woman genuinely wants to be a housewife and raise children she is considered as oppressed.
"Feminism is to stop exploitation of women. In this world, every living creature and human being live together, God has given us this world to live and not to discriminate.   Just as in the Indus Valley Civilization all people of the society had equal rights, we should learn something from them."

You are a very danger man of a india...

But I have to say the background was damn good man..😮"
"From which country are you watching this video? Tell me the name of your country

"Arey Druv Bhai Societ itni bhi Liberal Aur Samajdaar nahi hai, Jitna aap keh rhe ho hone ke liye. itne samajdaar log agr hote toh wars,police,military,courts ye sab toh hota hi nahi kabhi fir! Very HYPOTHETICAL things you have talked out here in this video"
feminism is zeher. yes I am a chapri.
we need more men like you in this world!!!
I’m taking the difference between feminism and matriarch from this video. Thanks Dhruv ❤❤
I think this video will clear many doubts
"Dhruv bhai, you are gay"
Solution bhi diya karo dhruv bhai
If you are feminist then I am mysogynist 😂😂😂
The only problem with feminism is the word itself. Dont create/use this problematic word. Dont waste time on organising its definition. Distribute man woman work with commonsense according thier  ability.
"vaah bhai kaise feminism ka galat example dene ke liye vishva hindu parishad hi mila na ki isse thode or gaye beete examples jaha halat or bhi kharab h . at 4:07 kaise specific religion ya fir right wing parties target kiya jaarha h subtle sense me . pata kaafi aaram se chal rha h . "" bhaut saari acchi baate karke beech me apna agenda bhi chalata rehta hu "". haalaki me bhi us baat ko support nahi karta hu lekin fir bhi .. aisi baate notice karna kaafi aam hogaya h dhruv rathee channel pe . jisko me neutral samajhta tha ek samay pe"
"ok dhruv i did see the video and i agree with most of the things you said. i think everyone should be given equally deserving rights and responsibilites, but i have a problem with one thing which i still didnt understand that IF feminism is striving for equality for all why is it put across as FEMINISM having orignated form ""females"". cant we name it as something like Equalist?"
I truly appreciate your efforts to spread awareness and basic knowledge and ethics among people ❤
🫡🫡🫡
I love the way you explained the actual meaning on feminism
aayein??baingan
Thankyou dhruv rathee for this video❤ log aksar du me bhi extreme feminist gali jaisa use karte hain aur feminist ko lekar ghatiya bahiyat soch failate nazar ate hain unhe kamla bhasin to ghar todnewali lagti hain hamare female classmate bhi feminist hone se inkar karte hain is video ki sakht jaroorat thi 🙌👏
Thankyou Dhruv for explaining what is feminism and the importance of it for everyone....I was tired of explaining this to whoever think feminism is woman centered and hatred for men. Now people who is confused about feminism will get a clear idea that  feminism means equality for all genders because most of the men in my family and my near and dear ones  follow you and support u...Bravo 🫡👏
Feminism was already clear to me  by Acharya Prashant. But nevertheless I loved this video.❤
"Excellent video Dhruv sir❤. But I think you should have highlighted one more point , that how women missuse Feminisms . I know you did mention about Neha dhupia etc. but what I want to point out is, this video would have been a lot more relevant if it was released a decade earlier. 

   In today's society. Just tell me one area where women are getting paid lesser than men for exactly same job profile given that she's making the same impact on the job😢. Don't have ans right?? Woh you might be thinking about sports section?? Let me tell u, it's indeed true women are getting lesser pay than a man if we think about sports like football. But Here's the point I mentioned earlier that ,""given they are making same impact"". In case of football the payment players get comes from total revenue generated. The total revenue generated in women's football is a lot lot lower than men. But women are actually getting paid around 20% of the revenue generated while men are getting almost 7%. Still many women are like ,""don't tell me reasons , I just want same pay as men"" . Didi, u will surely get paid the same if you are worth the same ammount. 

Sir should have put more emphasis on how most of today's generation of girls went around calling themselves as Feminist but in reality they all have matriarchy centered ideals😢. They'll just go arround doing and saying toxic things about men and try to gather sympathy by Playing victim card. 

Sir u said yourself that they should have equal rights as men. Why are u using ""should"".
Don't they already have it?? What rights are those that those self proclaimed feminist are fighting for??😢 Pls reply. 

Sir, I've watching you since 2020. I've lots of respect for u❤. I'm not trying to disrespect u in any way 😢. But, even if this video is great. I still fill it's not enough. So I most humbly request u to make another video on this topic . 

(There might be something wrong or inappropriate of what I just wrote, so pls let me know if u guys feel like I'm having some misconceptions. any kind of advice is appreciated)"

Very nice 🎉
Bhai 1 video Bhojpuri pe bhi ho jaye 😂😂
Feminism is right ❤👍🏻.I have seen sometimes when a girl is in wrong side at that time maximum people don't arise their voice.But when a boy is in wrong side at that moment maximum people arise their voice.Equal right=Equal Punishment
Very well explained 👌🏻👍🏻
❤loved it
Wearing hijab is a choice but respecting and showing love for your husband is regressive😮😮

WE WANT A VIDEO ON PAKISTAN'S POLITICAL CRISIS!!
One video for pakistan election
"How stupid is that if u consider looking after a house hold a less noble or prestigiuos job for a woman than to be an Astraunaut.
If all the females do job along with men who ll take of the house or children or old parents.
Thats why if u see the birth rates of the western countries are nose diving. And there is no one to take care of the elderly and there r lots of jobs available for old care because they dont want to make a family they only focus on their careers. 
If a man is able to perform in the society and get to a noble position in the society thats because of his mother and family. His mother provides him emotional and physical work support and his father provides faniancial support throughout his education.
All success that we men have achieved is because of our women, they r the entity behind it.
Man and Woman are equal in society but have different roles.
I love a bollywood movie related to this topic.
Addition: I didnt say that to look after a family is only female's job but my point is that they can do it better as compare to a man. If a man does household and a woman earns thats also the same thing there is nothing wrong in it but in majority women are gentle, soft, emotional and men are hard ,rational and less emotional so they perform certain task better and fails in certain jobs . 
Now imagine a man as an air host there would be a war in the sky."
People are nonsense apka video nahi samjha ga😅
I have 1 questions why women game exit?why they don't play with men?
Egalitarianism 🧢
"beautifully depicted the most sensitive topic, glad you equally covered what is feminism with what is not. Also, most of the girls have forgotten the true meaning of Feminism while getting inclined towards matriarchy (fight for what's needed, and not for replacing Patriarchy with Matriarchy). I read someone's comment below ""Treat how you want to be treated"".it goes superb with the video."
"Salute 🙏🙏
Itna behtarin content banane ke liye

background music is annoying AF
"Hi bhaiya... I really admire your work. Everything you say is so well researched and well put.
I request you to make a video on Smriti Iran's comment on no menstrual leave. I think my opinion regarding the matter is Grey. You could really help"

Hatts of to dhruv Rathee 👍
"App bde Kamal ke he , app itna zyada apne soch ko kese bdalete ho me app se jittna achee se padti  hu utna mere school me bhi nhi dikh pati , 😊"
Request to all men.... Kindly watch whole video then pass any comment....beautifully described real feminism
"What you are talking about is called gender equality. There should not be any ""ism."" Feminism is gender bias towards women."
Thanks for making this vedio  😊😊😊😊
This is the best video I ever seem
We need more people like Dhruv in this world ❤❤
My mother is patriotic
"No patriarchy, No matriarchy
Only equality.
Also right to opportunities comes equal responsibility.
And todays feminism is not like that.
If equality existed, many working women have denied alimony."

Thank you Dhruv for clearing the understanding of Feminism. I get it now. Its misunderstood in many ways.
"So many examples of Hindu & Christian society, Not even one example of any Muslim women, are they not oppressed, are they treated fairly in their society. Do they even know the word Feminism exists in society. I don't think Hindus need to be taught how to respect women, in our culture we worship them. I don't know why people give lectures on any foreign subject, which has very little relation  to our country but is portrayed as a serious issue like something is wrong in our culture in relation to that. Yes we are not equal, in my culture women are far more superior."
Soy boy
I want Dhruv Rathee to read about Prophet Muhammad.... He was the first to talk about Feminism
"At the risk of being called a ""misogynist"" here's my two cents as a socially conservative guy:
There are many people who don't oppose equal rights but oppose the way feminism manifests in society.
Everyone talks about misogyny and it is called out which is a good thing but misandry is heavily downplayed.
And many women resort to both feminist and patriarchal ideas depending on whichever suits them at the specific situation.
Many immoral and toxic behaviors are often promoted in the name of feminism using the argument of ""it's her choice"".
If you feminists really think that your ideology is good then in that case your marketing is terrible.
And by the way I'm not a misogynist. I also think so-called alpha males and incels are cringe.
I respect women who respect men and society as a whole as well as their own bodies. It's as simple as that."
"# We love you Dhruv Rathee for these kind of videos, I'm also a Feminist 😇"
Best Video On YT For INDIAN 🇮🇳 Youth
"The first time I didn't agree with your video
Jaise ki tumne hi kaha na ki wheelchair
Bhai khud usme logic dhundho n kya wheelchair ki race me ek fit aadmi daud sakta hai"
😅
You forgot to mention that `But real feminism is long gone` Now only ultra form of matriarchy left
he is only speaking one sided view  this happens in all videos
Please create a video on Electrol Bonds
"Brother,  I am teenager (16-17yr) I am following you scene 2yr back, my friends talk about toxic and make fun about sensitive issues ,they  don't agree with my thoughts which I leaned from you. In today's date I don't have friends (literally no , not a single friend since a year, and till a date) but   I will not leave my path which I choosen."
Wonderful Video 🥰🥰👌❤️
Phenomenal video bhaiya ❤❤❤❤ form tamilnadu
"Just like always, Dhruv came up with the right content, I've seen ppl who perceive feminism in wrong way, now this video is a perfect answer to such ppl....
Thanks for explaining feminism in the right manner ❤"
was expecting to hear about Hindu code bill and the protest to stop it.
Feminisam means a person who belive equall rights of both male and female
"Equal rights is okay, but what about people's who abuse those equal rights, ie lady slapps a man and calls be feminist, or she cheats and says you've cheated me in the past now I've done the same, I have equal rights? Uska kya? What about such peoples with such mindset? We want an equal world but these people don't deserve because they abuse, I wish the day come when they all are treated equally with you and me alive and you'll realise why they shouldn't have gotten equality, cheers!! We can't control everyone"
"When I was growing up, boys in my friends' group called me 'bro' and I used to be very happy thinking it was an honor to be one of them. It was my unconscious conditioning that girls are inferior. Thankfully as a woman, my thoughts have changed and I am proud to be a woman."
😂😂😂
Can someone answer me that if a men comes in saree dose women find him attractive as he comes in suit or they will think he is transgender because men does not feel women in suit as lesbian I can give atleast 5 more examples which explains women in career like feminism and in family like patriarchy I will not say much warna panga ho jayega 🙏 btw I 100% support women in work.
Farmer protest par video banaye sir please
You missed the part where our judiciary is so women centric that numerous innocent people are being falsely accused and their lives ruined.
Very deep understanding 👍 thankyou for the video..
if girl highly educated hai toh woh gareeb boy se marriage nei karta😀 but boy hai toh woh jaisa situation hai girl ki woh accept karta hai😂 yehi hai different 🤣
Respect for you increased today

Presenting a quote of Salman Rushidie is ignorant of you. Never expected from you. Any person who hates other religion makes a mockery of of other religion can never be legendary author.

So glad you brought up the Neena Gupta interview clip!!
@SSG_GAMER
"Great content..🎉 but it would be great if with mentioning garuda purana verses, regressive and anti female verses of Quran would have also mentioned."
"Do support bjp, its a good party"
I like Neena Gupta as an actor but cannot agree with her regressive thoughts
Agar aurat educated ho to vo job krna chahegi Or agar vo anpad ho to mazdoori ka kya😢
Thank you so much for this video
"Equal right and equality Between men and women are not same. 

Rights have to be equal ,  but physically,  mentality both are not same,  not equal. 
You can't change it,  Your Over progressive generation are spoiling the whole natural system which is formed to normalize  the human development,  and society"

"Wow! You're lucky to be born in India where you can freely discuss such contentious social issues. In my conservative country with the capital: Dhaka, making such videos would invite severe social backlash and, ultimately, a court verdict to take down the video to curb social unrest. India is on the right track. Keep going! 👏🏻"
nice
Today I got to know the meaning of Feminism 😮
"As a 16 year old, this video has helped me to develop my thoughts on feminism and social norms.
Thank you Sir Dhruv Rathee."
"Even after so much information, chapri gang is getting offended in the comments"
Feminism creates weak men
any feminist girl or women answer me - will you marry someone who earn 10k to 15k in India if you earn more than that.
Cancer toh tha
This should be taught in our schools. This is way more helpful than all those unnecessary things which are taught in our schools. That is why most people say that they learned way more from their own experiences than the things taught in school. Nice work Dhruv sir.
Men are becoming too soft nowadays😂... Good man is a man who has the capacity to be agressive but controls it... If a man is by default  very soft it just creates more problem for him
bhai tera gaon vala vlog dekha tha usme toh teri maa ne suit phena tha bhai apni maa ko bikini phena modern banao usse club m bhejo aur shots marvao tabhi modern banegi dhruv bhai 🤣🤣🤣
Getsetfly flearn already cover this topic
Please Make a Video on LGBTQ to make people aware
In the car accident example that you had given i believe most people rage out of shock not because of patriarchy.
"Your content is always amazing😊

You are making video on feminism, women empowerment , patriarchal society which is a good way to change the mindset of youth especially who blindly follow ideology of others 
and use their energy in right direction 😮😊❤❤❤"
Thanks for making video on this topic I love it❤

"Dekho bhai I just want you think over what I m writing write now whatever you are saying is just a 100 incident narration which make no sense ,you are not focusing on reason why its happening so, see this world and time is relatable to each other e.g. if a glacier melts it becomes water flows down and gets inpure with dust and environment , its is same with any society position and structure.  The life and event of a girl born in poor, middle class , rich family and its goes on like different ethnicity and believe system can't be same and her behaviour pattern will be according that. So her reaction to any situation will differ . So, it's all what is called life . Its same for everyone. People need to learn to expect accordingly and develop a sense to read these patterns."

looks like problem is on words and as irrespective of gender faces issues so better remove words and fights for eaqual rights oppertunities powers and independence🤔 to all humans irrespective of genders.
"My mama and mami both used to work and earn money Initially, my mama earned more than my mami, but unfortunately, he lost his job for some reason and was unemployed for two years. Eventually, he found a job with a good income, but by then, my mami was earning three times more than him. She decided to divorce him in 2015 and took half of his property. She remarried a CEO and moved to Oman. Now, my mama is single and lives with his mother in Hubli. We have tried to find another partner for him, but no one has agreed"
Sir apko bohot bohot Thanks 😊
Only fools believe on gender equality. There is many Times when womens need more rights than men like in a bus you can see separate seat for women but not for men. And somewere they Don't have to do this but they Just do it to became like a men..
"Mr. Dhruv rathee apki video content bhut accha ha feminism ke regarding .but apke representation only hindu culture ko define kr rahi hai mai ye nhi kha raha ki aaesh nhi hona chaiye but jis dharm ko jada vichar krna chaiye aap usko dikna ya represent krna to bhul gaye


aab mere se ye mat puchna kon sa dharm ,,,,aapko tho aache se pata Ha


VIDEO CONTENT -110%
REPRESNTATION- 0%( focus only one religion)


KEEP IT UP FOR NEXT TIME"
"As a social science student, i always had this view on feminism, i feeling so glad that you talked about this topic, bcz you have reach, may some people get some knowledge about real feminism. Feminism is not about getting drunk, and do one night stand, and so on, it is about rights and opportunities."
Awesome knowledge 👏👏👏👏
Hello 👋 Chris O'Brien!
"Dhruv, you just prove that what equality stands for..... Hats off you gem 💎......... I'm a great great great feminist 😊😊❤❤"
Please make a video on big fat Indian weddings. And how spending money in a huge reception should be a choice and not a social pressure.
"I am feminist according to defination but i disagree with the facts presented..World is paradox in itself, there are certain things which cant be done by man and can be done by women for instance giving birth and vice versa according to gender biology same happen with every creature and its not about our cultural biases it happend in everywhere around the world..They all exist to maintain equilibrium in the society and ..Capabilities are important deciding factors and not everyone can do anything ..Rights for votes and other rights are important to run the states and its man made thought..not suggested by nature..laws are man made and can have faults tol…i beleive Respect the difference and appreciate each other capabilities ..thats how we can create a good society"
Can you translate your videos to Bengali Languages? As like Ruhi Cenet.
wonderful and genuine analysis Mr Rathi. thank you
Wishing you a healthy and long life for you ❤️

This is unfair tumne yeh kyu nahi bataya ki neena Gupta ne Jo kaha woh tumhe kaisa laga
"But what if I don't want to cry. What if I am resilient enough to handle the ups and downs of life. It isn't necessary right? So don't glorify it.
Also, don't make this video any excuse for being weak, being unemployed. Just do what you wanna do don't care what the society says."
"Hi Dhruv I love your all videos but this was supperub, 👍 keep it up."
"Dhruv's a cuck , you dont understand what the role of a man and woman is in the social construct ."
"11:13 unemployed imagine be like: apna, khudka 😅😂"
"Itni sari confusion sirf ek video me clear krna 
Sirf Dhruv Rathee ke hi bss ki hai 
Thank you soo much for making this video 
I am gonna share this video to to everyone 😊"
what's wrong with seeing man and women different? its fact... and as far as I see no one is stopping women to achieve what they want... feminism this days are misleading toward broken society.... what this people are trying is not possible by nature.. why women soccer does not make as much as man's soccer..... some differences are meant to be there.. water is not air so air is not water... they both are related but still different.

"I think people need to understand that Feminism is not same all around the world. Feminism in US/UK is not the same in India. Western world have went pass Patriarchy from very long time and the mess that Westerners have made of Feminism shows what happen when you support a movement which no longer is needed. Their Feminism is not about equal rights but only men being good are Black or those who aren't white and women should be in place of power because they should, and not because if they are qualified of it. 

But India is completely different country. Someone saie that only in India, you can see the most wealthiest of men and also the most poorest of men. Similarly there are many women who don't only have the right from constitution but also support from Society to live their life as they see fit. As well women who still having the right are restricted to education, Job and deciding their own future."
Thanks for enlighten me about real feminism.
Protect this man at any cost!

"Unfortunately I had wrong definition in my mind about being feminist, now I had it clear , I want to point that this type of main concepts is not highlighted by the teachers in the school , i recently passed highschool and most teacher's focus on the wrong stuff rather than just presenting it to us and take our opinions"
Feminist is also a cultural imperialism
"Really thank u bhai, itne achhe se explain karne ke liye🙏🙏🙏"
There is a difference between Feminism and Extremism Sir.
Why did you not talk about misandrist women????
Equality of opportunity ✅ Equality of Outcome ❌ Egalitarian 💪

Thoda aur details main banao😊
Dhruv your content is so on point thankyou for showing us the side of instagram we keep ignoring
"Why not simply call it ""Equal Rights"" as it originally was. And why are the demands of the feminists limited to Tier 1 positions?
You certainly provided with the example of the legends who were working over the cause that cannot be challenged. But the trend, the recent leaders, their demands (that are limited to certain positions), the hipocricy, the way is now been positioned has formed a new perspective to the definition. A video over how Women are spoling the actucual notion of the 'ism' could bring much clarity."
"Ham ladke hai na , hamare sath aise he hota hai"

Dhruv...I like your thought process...it similar to mine as I think...
"Yes... Men & Women aren't Same

But they should get Equal rights"
An educated person would know feminism is not about superiority it’s about equality.

"As a psychologist, I  agree with Neena jee. Pregnancy is a huge factor and differentiator. In Europe (western society) many men leave as soon as the woman is pregnant. The woman can not leave the child cause he/she came out of her body. So how can you make it equal where the woman is now stuck and thus  sacrificing everything. So stop making these kinds of equality statements and be honest. Moreover I highly recommend everyone to go through the full podcast of Neena jee then you will know why she said that."

It's All About Our Worst Society 💔
"If Feminism does mean egual rights for women.. Then why not just call it equality? Is it because then you have to acknowledge the inequality men face? Like how men have to pay for the livelihood of his ex wife so that she doesn't have to do anything and sleep with her new boyfriends all day. Or like how a man can't do shit when his partner decides to kill his unborn baby. How a girl can ruin a boys entire life just by falsely accusing cause he is guilty until proven innocent. Or how majority of women when they start earning it's her money to use on cosmetics but when a man earn he is the provider of the family.
Just admit it girls you want equal rights but not equal responsibility. That's why you hide your matriarchal ideas behind the curtain of feminism. 
Other wise just call it ""equality"" And acknowledge that men are also treated unequally in our society. 

And Mr. Druv Rathee ap bohot data pel ke ek side ka sirf pros and ek side ka sirf cons dikha ke sabka mind distorted nahi kar paoge."
Morality and gratitude are needed.
"FEMINISM is not against MEN.
It's for women to get rights too."
"FULL EXPLANATION ON PUBLIC OUTRAGE IN LAMKA MANIPUR-
*Assam Rifles Fire at civilians in Tuiboung, Lamka causing heavy casualties.
In a scene reminiscing the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre of 1919, the Deputy Commissioner Shri Dharun Kumar S., IAS, gave a shoot at sight order which led to 3 dead and 100 critically injured at Lamka tonight(15/02/24).The incident happend after Shivanand Surve Superintendent of Police of Churachandpur District suspended a Police Officer for clicking photos with Kuki-Zo Village Volunteers. The protesters alleged that while the Chief Minister N.Biren Singh and MP Sanajaoba have often clicked photos with Arambai Tenggols, and while Manipur Commandos have also openly fought side by side with terrorists Group UNLF and Arambais, there has been no case of Suspension. Infact The Manipur institution runs only for the interest of Meiteis. What angered the protesters more was that when the Kuki-Zo Civil Societies met the SP this evening, he arrogantly dismissed them and said that action would be taken against the Officer by any means. Thus, the irate mob burned down Police Vehicles parked outside the DC's Office. The problem in Manipur now is that AFSPA has been removed from the Valley while it is strictly enforced in the Hills. While the Assam Rifles were supposed to first give warning even under the AFSPA, they directly shot at the protestors causing heavy casualties. It has also been alleged that a Meitei Sepoy among the Assam Rifles was seen directly shooting at the crowd. Meanwhile, angered further by the heavy casualty, the mob set ablaze the DC's Office and Bungalow which they saw as a symbol of Meitei hegemony and atrocity. The situation demands a proper Judicial Enquiry and a lack of faith in the Justness of the Indian government Will not bode well for this sensitive border state. Jai Hind.🇮🇳"

"What a content !! With full diverse relations of social spheres…

"i m a Feminist BUT I DISAGREE with 50% of your video,
Let's really look at it in logical perspective Dhruv,
1) What ideas/beliefs are TRYING to link with the word ""Feminism"" through BOLLYWOD or other Social media influencers??? (which has an IMMENSE impact on middle class mindset)
2) What ""middle class "" think of feminism? (there is a huge gap between reality and public POV )
3) What impact will this beliefs have on middle class human life? Social Relation? and Intimate Relation?
4) with this belief, how much baised decisions will be in any fight or ego conflicts between people? (such as false rape case, false dowery case, fase home violance case big example is JOHNY DEPP and men cant even defend it in any way)

See, i am not against feminism but i am awaring you how bollywood or so called Social media influencers are trying to take BENIFIT of this ""Feminist Wave"" to THEIR advantage. 

i want to write more but i have no time right now .. got to go bye...and please see take this points in mind ...

"Ek doubt aaya ye video dekh ke: 
Feminism ko to aapne acche se explain kar diya aur toxic Feminism se differentiate kar diya lekin masculinity ka kya? I mean difference between masculinity and toxic masculinity. Ya fir aisa to nahi ke sab words keval kuch words hai jinka koi meaning nahi 🤨"
"Your video is total 25mins waste 
Reason u don’t have a broader mindset u only speak what is positive thing to do but certain times these positive act give the worst negativity to society it’s just u don’t think practically if you do a good job thing that doesn’t mean the results will be good as well
In this video whatever you said is absolutely correct I won’t deny but what about the other side of facts you left them 
An ideal thing to do cannot always be the right thing to do
Equality is a strange bitch that cannot be served without being subjective and the best in this world can happen is providing similar rights to women like education officials posts and right to their speech it there are certain jobs they cannot have as well and vice veeza it goes for men as well"

"I feel ideally, people should be able to follow conservative values if they want to; but to get to the point that a bigger percentage of female citizens to be productive members of the economy is the challenge. Taboos should be undermined and a reasonable push to stop the conformity for a brief period for our society to prosper as a whole."

"Sir femininity and masculinity are two sides of a coin, whenever you talk about healthy feminism you must talk about healthy masculinity also. At the end of the day healthy femininity submits to the healthy masculinity to be preserved and prosper not only in humans but in animals also then originates healthy patriarchy but whole  point is irrespective of gender one should not exploit vulnerability of each other.

This is an absolutely great video for people to understand about feminism and to those people who are still in the wrong mindset of comparison between the 2 genders. Great work Dhruv!  This was a much needed topic to talk about.
"I agree with this ideology but the main point of toxic feminism is not talked in here toxic feminism is where female tries to supresss men by vindictive methods there are many eg of this but there is one that a female cheats on her husband but in her divorce by changing some pointers she is shown as a victim and the husband is forced to give half of his properties and also alimony on top even if the husband isn't at falthe is being punished another eg that I will take with the reference to the video is that if a woman's scotoor is crashed against a man's scooter socity will protect the women and harm the man is this what feminism is or is it toxic feminism. 

Ps whatever said in this video is completely true and I agree to most of these points and has completely changed my views on feminism but I clicked on this video for the above reason"
Bro you too is misleading from the men’s right

Tapped was copied from Pakistani movie Punjab nahi jaungi
Everything said in this video i agree but he doesn't understand that in india the action against men is done more aggressively and more like an announcement type whereas for women its a low key maybe hes just more influenced by his wife by making this video so i slightly disagree with him
13:28  🤯
"The day mothers teach their sons to cook and clean and make them responsible for all aspects of family and teach them to respect all women same as them, the society will change. Mothers first differentiate sons and daughters, then comes the mother in law. Men take super advantage of this. The day all women will start thinking their son is same as their daughter and teach the same, and stand up for it against the men who push patriarchy at home, there will be no patriarchy and no feminism. Awesome work Dhurv."

Feminism half a century ago was wonderful.....but now its just thrash....modern feminism is just garbage. There are people on social media who openly say the they dont care about men and that men are just useless to society....and the sad part is that men say that too....there was a time when men were strong and so were women.....but now its gone completely and utterly.... and i can feel that myself as a 14 year old boy.

Ek saval mujhe ho raha hai ki kya India aur abroad ke countries me Google ka algorithm alag tarike se work krta hai? Khas kar tab jab kuch important baatein search karni ho."

"@dhruvrathee don't show just one side of the society. You had speak about this fake feminism too which is currently growing fast. This fake feminism is also harmful for our society where these girls too advantage of lack of knowledge about the feminism among the girls.
Our society has come to know about all these patriarchy (CHAPARI) guys who are toxic.  So people avoid opinion of such CH***YAS and ignore them.
So from next time please try to put both sides IN DETAILS of the subject which you speak. We expect from you to show us both side of the coin unlike pur media."

What made u think men and women are equal? Men are designed for different purpose and women are designed for different purpose.. Don't spread this toxicity.. u r talking against biology and culture"

"Feminism is really important for the society for the equality. But some girls don't understand the term feminism properly which has created the new term fake feminism(Eg. If some guy is doing something for you with love then don't show the fake feminism instead appreciate his efforts). This fake feminism is destroying our society just like patriarchy. Girls/women should know the true meaning of feminism. I have elder sister so I can understand the true meaning of feminism, it's not like I am in oppose of feminism.

But in our society feminism is only promoting the rights for women the girls nowadays wants equity the want equal right(which I am support of)but they want men to pay for their expenses they treat men like trash and when it comes to them the society is always on their side if a women slaps a men according to society it's not a big deal but If men does the same then u all know what happens to him...BTW I support real feminism and I want a society where men and women are free to live their life as they want😊

"This video is 🗑️🚮 trash.. kindly look after what u are saying..  God created Man to be Leader and caretaker of family, but according to this video women need to earn equally? But why u need😂 to earn ? When ur man is alive? Isn't he responsible for providing? This are Female rights not male rights..  this liberalism is cancer for women"
Thanks sir i lost my patha . And i become a patriarchal mindset .tor some time now i understand.Thanku so muche sir
Dhruv you are amazing❤
"Very well clarified 🔥👏
I watch your all your videos dhruv. Everything is well explained. 👏
It's my request to you please make a video on toxic introvert.
Like how introvert and extrovert trend's are silently stopping peoples from expressing their true feelings from society.
I personally deal and faced so many issues with this introvert and extrovert norm.
I think this topic also need some spotlight. 🙏🙏"
So you think that the loudmouth feminists thinks about the challenges that men face? Don't be delusional @dhruvrathee

"Video is not complete.. ""Female nature"" in terms of intersexual dynamics is ignored here. Instead what you have done is changed it saying patriarchal mindset in women. This issue is very big. You have to take it in consideration. Otherwise no solution..."

It's sad but interesting"
You forgot to talk about feminism in the fillum called Barbie.
"I think this is the best video from you for me to learn i thought i knew about feminism but damn, it's really deep ,thank you ❤"
"I strongly disagree with you Dhruv Rathee for the first time. It's not only our Tradition, Culture or Religion that teaches us Patriarchy but there are other reasons for it too. Patriarchy doesn't mean that Men should abuse women but you somehow defined it like that by those examples you gave in the video. Mass media also promotes Feminism that doesn't mean the idea of Women given by feminism is an Ideal Women standard. And no our differences are not only physical differences of some organs but there are differences in our minds too, you can find many scientific studies on the difference between a male and a female mind. It's like you never approached to understand the perspective of a Rational person having patriarchal ideology, You are just assuming things about them and answered all of it based on your opinions. You never asked why patriarchy is better for the family and the society than feminism and you didn't even do much research about it. You gave many examples of Feminist men and only two of them had stable family relationships. Western countries are following this feminist ideology and we know the divorce rate in those countries. A stable family builds a stable society and a stable society builds a stable country. I know I haven't explained many things like how feminism is related to divorce so I hope you research it for yourself or my comment will be too long. Patriarchy doesn't mean that Men can oppress women but there are certain differences based on which we are given certain roles. I can also say people like you in mass media promote patriarchy as an idea where a man oppresses a woman but it isn't the truth. I hope you all don't misunderstand my comment as a misogyny. But he said any rational and sensible man would be a feminist, I mean you are not so rational or sensible because you didn't research enough on what basis the ideology that other person is. It's okay to disagree but calling someone who doesn't have the same ideology as you ""irrational and insensible"" without even knowing much about them is actually irrational and insensible. Thank you so much"
I am a woman and I am against pseudo feminism and equality. Man and woman aren’t same there should be justice not equality
Itna gyaan diye bhai quran per kyu nahi bole woh toh yeh tak batata how a women should be dressed
Good boy
What a thought by dhruv sir ❤❤❤ I actually understood what is feminism...🙏🙏🙏
My Respect For Dhruv Rathee📈📈📈
Bhai samne baithe k terse logical argument krna.feminism poore duniya ki problem don't protray like this problem only exist in india.India is way ahead of time in terms of gender equality take a example of our women prime in 1980 and use your softpower to show india as superpower.
Make a video on lgbt
I always have been a supporter of femanism beacuse that's how i have been raised in my family but the truth its nit just the chapri boys on social media who represent femanism in a wrong way but also the chapri girls who represent female in a very wrong way. I think both the genders needs to be taught what real femaism means. I bet most of the people be it male or female doesn't even know the real meaning of femanism.
I have say this this man is great. And he show us ki jo saba karta ha woi right nahi hota. Ami brain ka use kare and har chis ko deeply socha.and her ek chis ko khude jachi kara. Great man
Dhruv has educated lot of chapris
"Yadi equality ki baat hai to fir government ko reservation khatam karna chaiye.
Aur Jo faltu me SC ki baat karte hai ki general Wale unko untouchable mante hai to fir sc Wale bhi St walo ko asa hi mante hai .
Yaar chodo sab ase hi chalta rhega ye vote bank hai aur yadi kisi ko sach me castism khatam karna hai to sabse phele asa bolne Wale ko intercaste marriage karni chaiye."
"The way you called out Neena Gupta for her hypocrisy! And that's how you use your platform to influence, awaken, and empower. More power to you Dhruv!"

"I am a feminist and I didn't ask abt my husband's income before getting married. Why? Because I never imagined myself not earning. I don't earn merely for myself but also my family which includes my husband and children. Ms. Kamla Bhasin, qouted here, is one of the best on this topic. If you wish to learn more about feminism here's a short read: We should All be Feminists by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie."
Dhruv ji can  you do a video on Panama canal??
"Wow no mention of burkha, as if it's highest form of feminism 😂😂"

This video is a gem 💎 Kudos to all your hardwork
Raja ram mohan roy was t one who stood  for feminism
thank you sir ❤❤
Another best example for feminism is world first woman prime minister is sirimawo bandaranayaka in sri lanaka
"I think most of the men's psychological issues are actually related to ""women"" judging them based on how masculine they are, and taking a preference to the most alpha masculine guys (which btw is a result of millions of years of evolution). So naturally men try to conform to that role to find better chance of success with women.
For example, women will replace men at a high end exec job, and then also want to marry someone who is more successful than them also, while men have no such requirements.
Men on the other hand will always prefer better looks in their partner and are often willing to compromise on almost everything else, which is equally ridiculous."
Vai Weight gain par phi ek video banau🙂
After watching this video i cant differentiate between the reel feminism and patriarchy
"Why you are giving reference of a Hindu girl as a victim of patriarchy why not burkha girl because feminism is global topic ,  Christianity and Islam are the Majority in world Hindus is in minority so give reference of orthodox Christian girls and Islamic girls because we are the society of evolution, we can evolve without your critics. You just running your agenda by symbolise patriarchy with Hinduism."

Plz dhruv bhai ucc par video banaye 🙏
"I think the title of this video is too provocative. Maybe the title should be ""what feminism actually means"". I feel like the title of this video is targeting the demographic of anti-feminist men. It repulses the women population."
Bahut osm video 👏👏
Amazing 😍🤩

How about a video on illuminati 🤔

Do your research properly... don't mold the things according to your thought...you are talking about feminism on basic level but actually its roots are very dangerous for society and family system
"Everything has its own value. 
Difference on gender caste creed color nationality economically job status etc has its own way of respect.

I feel so relaxed when i read comments and there are so many teenagers who understand the difference between right and wrong.Dhruv Bhai is really making New India.Big applause 👏
Please 🙏🙏 electrol bond ke bare main video dalo
"When the fking patriarchy existed there were women in prominent positions like nurses doctors vocalist entrepreneurs etc..... Difference is that just like men hard working women reached the position.... In patriarchy men were sent to war if they were 18 years old mercilesly......... Nowadayz women want to go to lions den and say that society is wrong.... If a man walks on the same streets as you he will be beaten up and half killed......😂...... Is it male privileges...... Women get jobs without working hard......... I dont care what feminist mf's think... Im not sigma..... Iam a boy who have an 18 Years experience in life..... I've seen many men who's life have destroyed to favour women...... Cry out loud now...... Men have always been causious but women due to evolution lacks that... That is why they demand to have the right to go to dark alleys were cultured men dont go🗿.......... Also women are trying to see men as a standard...............You will be paid only if you work as hard,not because you are a women 🗿...... Women need no privilege....... Ive seen strong women who have never relied on feminism......... 🗿they are the true womens............... Women will not be respected unless they do something🗿..great🗿"
It shouldn't be name as feminism instead it should be called as equal- ism. Feminism is a wrong word.
"Aapki batein bhi illogical hain is video me...Nye nye word khoj laao english ke or phir usko streach krke gyaan pel do...I'm ur fan and follower 80% of the times. But this one falls in 20% same as like your reservation video.
If you don't know the situation on ground level, then you must not speak on that topic this deep. Reality yhi hh, ladki or ladka alag hai or rhenge. Equal rights are okay in jobs and some others specific fields only but not everywhere."
You rightly described the feminism and  patriarchy.. thank you so for this video 🙏🏻🗣️❤️

@dhruvrathee sir are you feminist...?
So as per you dhruve rathee with due all respect . The person who badly commented on religious personality is a legendary. I would suggest you something. Don’t depend upon your team .. research from your side also .. read understand and open your mouth
19:47 finallly someone said it logically
"Reason for hate is not women its the unnecessary advantages given based on reservation and diversity in name of feminism i am not saying these should not be given but should be given based on needs, cause a girl whose father is earning in crores is also given the same privileges as the girl whose father is barely feeding the family according to me the concept of solving these issue using reservation and diversity hiring is completely uterless and is not improving the conditions at all"
I loved to watch dhurv dada videos but this one is kinda out of topic like it's portraits only men is worng.
goosebump's
"Well made video! But the real challenge today is misogynists using feminism's brand name to push antiwomen legal policies in which any man can identify as a woman by taking up regressive  stereotypes attached to women.  

And co opt their reservations, sports category, prison spaces, washrooms etc. 

This isnt a joke. Its a serious issue that many refuse to even acknowledge. Or simply cancel other saying transphobic. As of womens safety and fair right arent imp anymore."
it's a common sense to support feminism.
Bakwas
Ya fir sirf mai akela hu jo India se hu kyoki..humme se bahut log hai jo aapki video dekhte hai aur unko English ni aati hai...
Feminism nature ke qilaf hai. Mard aur aurat alag alag hai. Kan ank ki baat kar rahe ho. Janwar me bi hai  kya Janwar bhi Insan hai
"I like dhruv's content but this is a very misleading video..

The current scenario of Feminists is more inclined towards matriarchy... Undeniably...

As much as I'm a feminist in the true sense, I would never support the feminist moment in its current form.

Women and men are not equal, that's a hard fact.. take it or be delusional. Giving an argument that two men are also not equal for some trait change is very foolish. In that way every animal is similar to humans...

However women and men should have equal rights."

Aur ek bat sir kya aapke videos me English me comments karna jaruri hai..? Kyonki sirf mai hi Hindi me comments Kiya hu
"I totally agree with this video 👍
But just want to say one thing as a woman that toxic feminism is real, I have seen this among my friends. I have seen many girls doing bad things and justifying it in the name of feminism. 
Recently in my state a woman killed her husband and mother in law and many girls were defending her saying that she did right thing and she did take revenge for all the daughter in law who were killed and abused"

"Ya know, u can beat around the bushes about the CHHAPREES, but u're doing EXACTLY what the CHHAPREES do. Leaving the REAL points of ILLOGICAL LAWS in Sex CRIME n DIVORCE, made by FEMINISTS in last 60 yrs specifically.

And pointing at anything that sounds LOGICALLY right to you.
I CHALLENGE  you or ANY FEMINIST out there to Get into a LOGICAL discussion about Feminism with either me or even ELON MUSK, and we'll rub the floor with your Brains SMASHED.

TALK about how Burden of PROOF was transferred to Alleged CRIMINAL in SEX CRIMES.
Talk about how WOMEN have RESERVED seat for having a VA-GINA, but not FOR MEN having a D-ICK.
TALK about how FEMINAZI countries like INDIA have all SEX CRIME and DIVORCE laws against MEN,
And they were ALL enforced by Feminists (Male n Female) in just last 100 yrs, not by PATRIARCHY.
And U'll see, your FEMINIST LOGIC runs into a DRAIN.

And for any ignorant people, who don't know, Feminist propaganda is on for about 160 yrs in the WEST. They're effecting the laws all over the world and for at least last 60 yrs in INDIA alone. YOUR CONSTITUTIOn and 100% of POLITICIANS are licking Feminists BOOTS all year long."

Lagta hai tujhe kisi ne  mara hai isiliye iss topic pe video banaya
One of the worst video of Dhruv Rathee.
I think TMBNIL was changed
"It is true that feminism started with the purpose of equal rights, but recent incidents are proves that feminism has taken a wrong direction now and it should be scrapped and some other movement like equalinism (or something) should be started. Cases where women harass men with the same rights provided through feminism are increasing and men don't have any rights to defend themselves, more wives are cheating upon their husbands. There are scams going on in the market with the help of women. 
Additionally, the job market is suffering because of international reasons, the pressure of income is upon the males in the society (even most of the women pressuries males), with the growing population the competition increases, at the same time various jobs have got cast based reservations, on top of these now even women have started competiting, so it has become very hard for the males to atleast land a job. (My personal experience in my college on-campus placements is that companies prefer an unskilled woman upon a skilled man). 
Moreover indian constitution has always tried to not discriminate among any of the groups, so there is no need of any movement to get rights (rights are there already). It's the social stigma that needs to be addressed and that can be done through awareness campaigns.
Personally I don't support any movement, I think nothing is permanant and hence nothing should be made into a necessity. Infact the people who have qualities should be given the chances, and it should not be taken as a pride that there are more male workers / female workers / trans workers. I wonder when will people start treating work as work and not associate it with status, gender, caste, etc."
I’m glad that you exist. ❤
I totally agree with that 100%..     I am also a faminist

It is obvious that women should have equal rights and opportunities but if men and women are equal then why there is reservation for women not for men in politics or in competitive exams.

Good topic
This is a better video than his previous video on Animal. That was poorly narrated and scripted. Throughout the video it felt like Munu is actually him.
"I agree with you, there is a minor confusion, you said men and women are not different, they are similar and should be equal, u took examples of men having a high IQ and a low IQ,they have equal rights. But don't we have caste based reservation for this exact thing? Bcz those men/women belonging to lower caste gets more benefits than the upper caste, is it equal then? And if you study in detail, the people taking advantage of reservation,most of them don't need it, and who deserve it don't get it. How that's equal rights?"
Bhai Mai Toh Na Sehta !
Thank you for this video. I was appalled at a female youtuber using nonsensical Bollywood movies which flopped as clickbait and speak against feminism.

I like the video. Well explained what is real feminism. I do regular watch your all videos. I just have few questions. Does women's don't have equal rights in India??? Does men's have rights which womens have?? Does women take benefits over men by using the feminism word?? Are we really exercising gender equality in India?
Thankyou for understanding the meaning of feminism

"I agree with you, but don’t you think that, if mostly society is in the wrong definition of the feminism. Even girls are taking different meaning of feminism like Neha Dhupia. and if girls are taking wrong way then, if male will support them, it will be like a provocation to them like a Mumbai girl slapped a taxi driver."

Thnq so much dhruv rathi 🤩
Thanks for taking up the topic. I wish we all research over topics from right sources and ponder over it. Mere use of dictionary will bring clarity in lots of false portrayal of every other issue. Seeking knowledge is the key.
"Sir I definitely support feminism but there's one thing that never clarified . Exactly what mens rights are feminists fighting for? Cuz there are no laws in india that prohibit women from doing a particular occupation or just doing something. So are we just fighting so that society should not become male dominant?? Because i think male dominance and all doesn't work anymore atleast in a community where i live
Liked the concept though . I had to work on a project and it really helped❤"

"Thanks for the video Dhruv. There are few things that I disagree with,

1. Women wanting a man who earns more and is taller than her is due to evolutionary reason as opposed to societal conditioning. This preference can be seen all over the world regardless of what society women are living in.
2. Feminism may not have shown support for women assaulting men but they also didn't criticize either. Their silence led to chapri gang making all kind of assumptions.

As always, I stand with equal access to education, nutrition, and job market to all regardless of gender."

"The problem is that a lot of women believe in this pseudo feminism where women are raised up higher than men and given more opportunities compared to men. Equality doesn't mean preferential treatment. Equality doesn't mean diversity hiring in corporates to advertise their oh so inclusive work culture. Equality doesn't mean that a complaint by a woman against a man is taken seriously but a complaint by a man against a woman is laughed at. Equality very literally means the very opposite of providing better benefits and opportunities to one segment, which is what is happening with the current understanding of pseudo feminism. 
Yes, it's true. No feminist condoned these acts that you showed in the video. But did any feminist condemn these acts? Do the real women feminists looking for equality stand up and say no this is a benefit that you're providing to women that we don't want coz this goes against the spirit of feminism?"

Hi
This video is not relevent for modern day feminism....... All they want is multiple sex partner without any consequences....... And berade men....... Whatever feminism  was back in the day its molded into man hating community bcoz of movies like veere di vedding and thanku for comming..........and not crying at everything is not exclusive to masculinity its basically strong people dont cry regardless of gender...........

"men and women are not same because nature designed it for a specific reason. Man killing more themselves than women because of feminine toxicity. Women should be given right to pursue there career freely and paid on the basis of skill but in reality modern society will collapse as female will get more interaction with opposite sex and will eventually leave there partner for high value man. Best example kareena kapoor she left Shahid to secure her future by marriage rich saif . She is a idol for many women so women deeply believe this then whether you pay them equally or not they will develop there own reason to abonded there family for money and power. It's inbuilt no education can change this. Our Society is already started collapsing by increasing no of failed marriages, father less or motherless kids. Just focus on Better things instead of who should get more right or not it won't matter in upcoming years"

"First time seeing you being this one sided about an issue ! Both males and females have got their own responsibilities naturally. I know elites are trying their hardest to get taxes from both sides. When success would be considered with how much money you earn, happiness loses its place  without knowing. Maybe I am wrong but I don’t see 5% of females going in a war! And I believe this is not their role. If there was a war, I would consider myself to be a part of it and keep my family safe. Equal rights can never be a thing in the world ! It has never been! Thats why you would have steak tonight and someone would be starving. 

Yes, at the end of the day its your choice if you wanna put your child in a daycare or raise by yourself! But I wouldn’t be happy if my mother didn’t raise me. A family is a team, Would you put a goalkeeper as a striker and a striker as a goal keeper? But but but its a goalkeeper’s role to save goals.. exactly. Don’t get me wrong that I am supporting any toxic masculinity 😂"
"This video is exactly why men are being ruined in society. Societal programming. Life as a man has always been hard, name one time in HISTORY, where it’s been hard. Teach men stoicism. Stoic men are needed in society. telling men to cry more and act out their feelings is why we have school shooters, rapists, toxicity. All of it. If you have a man who is stoic, does what a man needs to do, you will find a powerful man who is GOOD for society."
"Few days age my brother's wife cheated him and she said she don't need this family anymore....they have a daughter also...this incident literally breaks my heart....

"4:54 Shame on you Dhruv!! You mocked the Garud Puran because it enlisted features of an ideal wife for the sake of your feminism, Then why don't you say - 
why female companion names appear before males when we take names of our almighty couples for example; Radha Madhav, Gauri Shankar, Siya Ram 
Also popular characters are known by their mother's name and not by father's for example; Hanuman - Anjaneya, Ram - Kaushaleya, Arjun - Kaunteya, Karn - Radheya
Please stop spitting incomplete facts at least about my Sanatan Dharm. Either say it completely or don't say."

"Bro, women have equal rights, and every man supports them, it's not about their rights, it's about how they act as a man in their sexual life. Feminists are not fighting for social rights, they are fighting so that girls can go out and party like men, wear short dresses and sleep with any guy they want like a man can do. Which is impossible because no matter how equal they are in social life, there's a basic difference in our body and hormones. And ik u still can't understand. It's not about kalpana chawla. It's about the girls who act in series like 4 more shots. Those girls are not kalpana chawla bro and they never can be."

"The points you make are about 1st and 2nd generation feminism, but the 3rd and 4th generation feminism captures opposing views to the 1st and 2nd - especially with the addition of trans, which pollute the definition in its original form.

While your video addresses the 1st and 2nd generation points, it fails to express its distinction on the 3rd and 4th generation meaning of the term. Which can in turn could mislead. I would presume that this topic isn't covered in its entirety or was made in a hurry with clickbait terms. 

The definition of terms in language evolve over time and unfortunately language cannot sufficiently capture the evolving nature of them."

"Thank you for making this video, I have watched many of your videos and I just feel good as there is someone with real power to influence huge number of people, about topics which I also keep on stressing in my immediate society, however possible. 
On another point, I have a doubt, will this society can ever be feminist as the hierarchy is always based on the paternal side? Titles are always adapted by the females and not the other way?
But if we look at science or the nature, it takes both the males & females to create life.
Can this patriarchal society can ever evolve and be logical enough to see that nature always shows us the equality and necessity of both the genders and the harmony between males & females for creating and living a life, and stop suppressing each other? And also, I feel Indians have a longer way to evovle than the other developed countries, which are already on the path of understanding this fact."
"Obviously he is turning into western ideologies after he got married to a foreigner woman. This guy has no religion he believes in Darwin's fake story. According to his ideology when there was war between Ukrainian and Russian women were also supposed to fight for the country but instead they were shifted to other countries.Only men fought , now think if government had said that women will also fight ,think what would have happened??This is not even logical whatever is saying as I told you maybe these Western people are just giving him funding to spread their immorality to other parts of countries so that people will accept Atheism and other incorporeal wars."

And how we can punish them, its not like go to the court and wait for 10 years, and first of all find the victims!😢😢"
"Some people are still confusing between Patriarchy (more right & power to men) and Matriarchy (more right & power to women). You have to understand that, feminism is not just about females because it has 'fem' in it. It is a common ground between Patriarchy (toxic masculine) and Matriarchy (toxic feminine) simple. Feminism is a balance between Patriarchy and Matriarchy. Those who use ' toxic feminism/feminist ' while talking about some negative thing done by a woman, let me tell you there isn't anything like it. You can call them stupid, wrong, immature, etc. and same goes for men. The way we call some negative movie done by women as toxic, why don't reject many negative movies done by men as toxic. If one gender can be wrong why not the other gender and considered as cool attractive. Isn't that hypocrisy ? When feminism talks about that hypocrisy it becomes negative for some people and they call ' toxic feminism '. And some girls are not staying low in the race, call them selves as feminist and do all possible stupidity using the tag.  So in my opinion we have to choose common ground.. feminism. Some comment here saying why feminism, why not other name for the movement ? I ask you even if there is a name change will the cause change ?!! ☺"

"Great feminists like raja rammohan roy and jyoti bai phule must have started from at least somewhere(from zero) but they somehow did made the society better. So if we also want to change the society to whatever extent we want, how can we spread awareness among people. We cant win in argument with illogical people. ""Its difficult to win against wise people in argument but nearly impossible to win against a stupid"". So how can we spread awareness among people who are brainwashed? Like they say things completely illogical in name of religion, what can we do against that?"

"Justice is better than equality, having equal opportunity is not justified when someone needs more support than others. Demanding equality will resolve general discrimination but not resolve such cases where special care is required depending upon the scenerio:
1) Remember the slogan when ship sinks: Ladies and childeren first
2) Giving your seat to elder person because that person needs it more
3) Allowing ladies to skip the queue
that is the major reason not to support feminism.

Wasn't the video about toxic femanism then when did u shift to other topic i.e patricarcy ik it's somehow related to femanism and it but why did u change the topic wasn't the topic should about how women are misusing their rights in the name of femanism how the meaning of femanism has changed as the time passed and how advantage of such rights are taken by so called educated women against man and discrimination them and creating a situation of helplessness and vain for the men. You said that no real femanism support acts like Neha dhupia and the Lucknow taxi incident but neither they criticise it and indirectly let it happen and if they actually care about equality then they should also support men for their rights why fight for only equal rights of women as if that's the only gender in existence. Why did u shift the topic to patricarcy and making people believe than man is the absolute casue of everything behind every pain every discrimination every problem even problems related to their own loneliness is themselves why are creating a situation of self doubts for men. The topic u should be addressing is about toxic femanism not what is real femanism and where it derived from unlike the video of animal where u openly expressed toxic masculinity it's like u blaming everything on men and urself creating an irony idk what's your agenda or objectives are but the way u expressed the video it feels than u are the one who promote matriarchy.
Very well explained!!! Only Dhruv can do this!!
"Physical, hormonal, phycological differences between men and women are big enough that different laws are made for each.

Feminism is not natural and by equality you weaken family as synergy in complementary roles is destroyed. Only divine guidance is objective, balanced, and gives just rights to both genders. Modern and subjective ‘isms’ like these is a clear recipe for more crime, depression and civilization collapse like the West."
"Today females are not feminist ,they are matriarchal"
Bravo !
Wow! Impressive and enriching concept for everyone to make a balance society ..
Faminist kuch nahi fool hote h 😂😂😂
We need such talks in our society. Thank you for this video Dhruv.
"Sir, thank you for such a  informative video. I had many misconception about it. But do you think people who claimed themselves feminist has a clear concept about feminism. Don't they idolize worst type worst type film.

Lastly, is my English ok?😂"
"You are a good propagandist.
What is Equalism?
Blame shifted from society to patriarchy.
What's patriarchal feminism?"
"Nice one Dhruv, kindly do one research on Narcissism too.  A much needed in today's society."

"No rape law for man ?
No extramarital affair law for man?
Why should man would pay for woman’s livelihood after divorce?
And much more which is missing in men’s right but no real “feminist” talks about it. Just blames mens for all thing."
"Wonderful content, as always and very clear yet humane take on such a complex issue. Actually it should be very common sensical, but years of social conditioning have put layers of stigma - so much so, to understand the real issue requires unpeeling of few layers.

One thing to add: while we all cry foul about “rights”, the “responsibility” aspect is often overlooked - and along with Bollywood-inspired toxic feminism, this is another reason for misinterpretation of feminism. For instance - many women do jobs and earn money, but very few (at least in India) put themselves as primary (or equal) responsible person for family’s financial security. Thats still the ‘mans job’.

As long as one interprets feminism as means to be equal/ equivalent in both responsibility and rights - and not as some fancy buzzword to exploit men, or squeeze out the best of both worlds - you understand it was never about just men or women, it’s purely “humane”, and honestly, there’s no other way.

At the end, nature didn’t create us to compete against each other - but to complement."
You are right in this video but there is another side to this argument where women take unfair advantage of feminism to target men and exploit them in the name of feminism. You should have talked about that too.

"What i understand of Patriarchy is a system where men rule and take important decisions ! 
It has nothing to do with anyone's right to equality ....
I believe in equity but i am also a proud patriarchist .... 
Everyone should have equal rights but rulers should always be true men ! ....cause naturally men are better rulers .... This doesn't mean a female ruler can't be elected ..... In case where there is no competent men then woman must rule ...."
"Are only boys referring to content like four more shots as feminism or some girls are also deriving their definition of feminism from there? 

The generation needs a proper education for feminism. 

What some men are doing wrong, women wanting to do same thing is not feminism."

"Hello Mr. Dhrv, very sorry to say nothing waa made clear in this video, most importantly you missed the psychological aspects which diffrentiate a man and women. What you actually tried to explain ia that a paradim shift needs to be made for the evolution of an utopian society which is sounds absoluteley impossible, too many reasons for that which needs a whole new discussion which will involve topics like human psychology, physiological characteristics, geographical placemnents, nature of works etc. Many people are already fighting over it all over the internet ..."

"-You injects your mind's toxicity in society via videos

-You manipulates the comment section

-You, yourself researched and collected the data/info where people opposing the so called ""feminism""

-If you have courage, do a survey in open society and see yourself whether the fake feminism is ruining the society, families and relationships

-I challenge you to do a debate. I bet, when I'll start arguing, you will not have the justifiable answer on 90% of the points which you are supporting

-I used to like and follow you earlier when you were neutral and unbiased, but now I hate you 

-You are just doing ""business"" by keeping your videos in left-wing to standout different, regardless of the results in society, You dirty business-minded creature!"

Modern feminism is rubbish
The problem is that most females themselves don't understand the concept of feminism.
"This is the kind of English I don't like. Manism, Patriarchy and Matriarchy are bad, but Feminism isn't! It is like calling a White Horse a Donkey because it is White! Whoever has specified the meaning of Feminism as ""equal rights to women"" must be an idiot, a stupid."

"THIS NEEDS TO TALKED ABOUT, including female actors in film industry are definitely making films and promoting TOXIC& WOKE FEMINISM, which  just so sad. ALSO, ANOTHER MORE IMPORTANTLY CONCERNING IS THAT IN INDIA IF WE TALK ABOUT MANY GENERAL CONSUMERS OF SUCH CONTENTS (indian men specially along with indian women), are NOT EVEN EDUCATING THEMSELVES about what feminism stands for actually, instead they are feeding on some DISTORTION MEANING PAINTED FOR SUCH IMPORTANT SUBJECTS like 'FEMINISM' ,like one of those was 'thank you for coming' . Also, some very popular indian actresses are promoting such distortion. SO TO FELLOW INDIAN& PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD, dont belittle your prospects of educating yourselves, and not being dumb to not educate anymore from scratch."

"If what u are saying that these toxic and fetish movies are not depicting Feminism then bro on what basis you are saying that Animal and Kabir type movies are depicting right masculanism
Masculinity means Bravery,unity, dedication,passion,Responsible,Be serous and sincere,To stand for Justice,etc
Feminism is not even able to define what is female
There is first wave which doesn't agree with second wave of feminism abd second with third and so on
If we Highlight the Toxicity of Feminism then people like Dhruv rather says it's not feminism
But on the other hand when the come to criticize Masculinity then the connect every negative thing like beating wife,drinking,smoking,etc to Men,bro why u doesn't say that this is also not masculinity"
❤
Today i realize that all men are not same dhru. barvo!  outstanding i appreciate you very well and thanks
I dont have problem with feminism. But with the girls being egoistic after being successful and if a man becomes egoistic it is bad too. But i just hate egoistic feminist girls
Please explain masculinity also

"I Think that Everything is Explained with Respect to westernism
What the Europe and western says is not always true
There is fault in everything
If we see in the past then we see the Unity,Bravery,Dedicated,Hard working,Loyal etc in Men
On the other today this so called
Atheism
Agnostim
Secularism
Liberalism
Modernism
Feminism
Humanistic etc has destroyed the whole social fabric of the society and world
I am also Man,I if against feminism then I have patrichal mindset,on the other if I any women is against feminism then it's due to social conditioning 😂😂😂😂"
meanwhile me being a taller gf as well as i earn more than him nd this never affected neither my man or me...women are also patriarchal while choosing their partner and doesn't see other man just like a man instead they expect so much from their partner without giving much in return and that's also a real issue

Why women are not in front when there’s war? What about ukranian men? They are still fighting? But women has left the country !!!

Truly genuine video. Best explained
"Hi Dhruv, big fan here. just a little thing. There is a common trend these days to use the word CHCHAPRI. There needs to be awareness regarding the word. Chchapri's are a caste oppressed community who makes temporary roof. The use of this word as a slang promotes Casteism and Demeans them. Hope you address the common slangs like dog, chamar, chhapra etc which are actually a Caste."
"Thank you druve! Now I have a clear idea about feminism, yours is the best video as compared to recent videos"
Wonderful 🫡
Wo berojgar ka photo kiska tha....haha😂
Most of the time we see fake feminism or feminazism instead of feminism. There are lots of false cases of rape or molestation because these fake feminists take advantage of their power and abuse it. Patriarchal people too exploit the women taking advantage of their power. Both are harmful.
"Feminism is about equallity, you are right about that, women should be treated equally i agree with it completely. But...
 the other things you talk abt. 
Like wage gap, it depends on the hours you put in, in the corporate world, in entertainment biz it depends on the amount of crowd you pull in, same with sports, thats how biz works if women do the same amount of work put in the same amount of shifts and yet are less paid n it has been goin on for long dont you think companies wd hv hired more females than males so they cud exploit them financially?
I mean big companies set up their manufacting units in 3rd world countries for a reason, ie cheap labor bein a major one, in biz it is always high profit less investment, you should understand that you are in a biz urself, i am sure you pay ur crew on their working time n amount of hours put in rather than basing the pay on genders. Like wrestler rhonda rousey says i am paid  more because i bring in more crowd, if someone else does that they will also be paid more, fashion industry is dominated by women, women hv higher pay than men, because thats good business that is how business is, a man cannot say there why am i paid less, because he dont bring in same amount business in fashion industry as women do. 
Then you talk like motherhood aint part of empowerment or feminism, shouldnt it be their choice to work, be a housewife, be a mother or do a combination of two in the first
place. Men n women are different if they werent why would there be a need of gender classification in the first place, i can understand where u r goin at with eg of we hv same organs n all but there certain things a man cant do, certain things a female cant do, like breastfeed for eg that is how nature intended it to be.
Another one is alpha male, yes some 🤡 s who call themselves alpha males who in real are jobless wimps lacking responsibility drop unnecessary hate towards women, the same way dont u think misguided privileged well educated spoiled by parents modern feminsts who seek n attract attention for their insecurities over some jobless idiots views over petty issues like short dresses or other dumb stuff, changing the attention from a great movement shud be treated as a hindrance as well and at the same level of the misguided toxic males, cause all these people do is blame one gender. when feminism fights against injustice like physical abuse n other unfair ways and for equallity. There is broader perspective to lot of things.
Western misguided ideals hv heavely backfiredfor them, these misguided notions hv left them split, bitter and divorced leaving their children with troubled, financially unstable familes, parents who become drug addicts, irresponsible, which leads them to be put in foster homes where they abused or mistreated most of the time, leading them into the path of crime and the cycle of events keep coming back for more. Its high time we woke up from misguided misunderstood ideals from the west, ( no hate against west, they themselves agree to this, as statistically proven in crime rate survey mentioned in the book freakonomics)
In the end an equal contribution lays path towards a better 2moro, for everyone involved but there are certain things that differentiate us men n women and that shouldnt be a problem if we understand & aknowledge them be there when one needs other.
This is nothing against you, a big fan always watch ur vids, will do so in future too. But just that on such sensitive topics shud hv put broader light like u normally do. Appreaciate your work."

bro what did she do?
 lalia zara killed john liebert and what is the reason? the reason is he say hi to a girl and lalia zara killed him.
i am not saying that feminism is wrong. 
i am trying to say feminism is right and wrong.
let me give you a exmpale.
if a beautiful girl tells a man to help her mans will agree and that girls always uses the man and mans think that the girls is obbsed with me. then the girl is wrong cuz she is using a  man who help her.
other side, if a trusted but ugly girl tells to a man to help her then the man will not agree there is a little chance that the man will agree and if he agree that ugly girl will happy and always thankful to the man. then that girl is right cuz she are always thankful for  that man who help help her.
we are not same yet, but we will same soon. everyone should get same rights. 
                                                                                                           (no hates)"

"I'm a feminist and I love my husband more than anything.. live with my in laws, working and do take care of my two kids mostly alone since my husband is not in town always..

So feminism doesn't have anything to do with a male or female person... it's just you being open minded to accept every individual as they are and not to think they are at a tad lower level than you"
Super video  bro
Keerthi history already made a great explanation of this topic before. Kudos to her for bringing this
"*Let's talk about equality -*
If a husband cheat on his wife, then file wife can an FIR against husband and put him into jail.... *BUT*

If a wife cheat on his wife then court will give two options -
1. Get divorce and give maintenance to wife every month of 30-40% of your income or either 
2. Don't get divorce and live with a wife that do adultery in front of you and you can't do anything.

Where is the equality?

Doesn't matter what definition given in dictionary, in reality *feminism means women superiority*"
thank you for this beautiful video before this I was also very confused within the concepts
Very well brother. = Homo
Thanks for making this meaningful video.
"While I agree with Dhruv, I don't think gym culture or specifically muscular males promote misogyny. He is generalizing extensively."

Pls show you are not patriarchal man who only know talks .."
"today i got the right perspactive about the feminist word, till today i believed that i'm not feminist, but now knowing this word better after seeing this video and researching i can proudly say that i'm feminist, and i'll be. thanks dhruv bhaiya for making this beautiful informative video...❤❤"
Totally Rubish. you are manipulating rights into equality.
Alot of points you made had nothing to do with patriarchy in general but go off
"Why tf are you using the word ""chapri""? All is fine but what kind of liberal or radical or even human behavior is that?"
Bhai dekhi meaning aur definition ye sam admi ke ghumane ke liye hai jaha injustice ho waha aawaj uthao chahe o ladki ho aa ldka just treet as human. Thank you.
Dikkat bas yahi hai femanism ka sab support karte hai q ki yesa karne se wo mordern aur cool lagte hai lekin jaha asdmi ke justice ki baat aati hai inke muh par tape lag jata hai waha nahi kuch bolte fir lagte hai femanism ka meaning batane. Par isne yk baar vi kisi aadmi pe video nahi banai hai jinke santh galat hua ya kisi aurat ne galat kiya q ki yesa karne se ye cool nahi lagaga.

"Dhruve bhai ....aap ne animal movie  ka example leke samjaya tha how it will affect mental psychology..... Please ek video girls ke bhi banao ke ye 4 more shorts jesi movie or series unke metal psychology pe kese asar karti hai ......

Requesting you bcz log tumhe sunte hai..."
"The real question was, you were ready to criticise Animal scene by scene in your video(of course, it was a trash film), but for the movies that are misleading the feminist  movements you just swiftly showed the posts made by critics? Where's your video on those films pointing what's wrong scene by scene? Or you accept that your video on Animal was just to farm views? Critics made valid points about all films you talked about, but it's funny that you decided to make video on only one of them and gave a ""yeah thats bad too"" for the rest."
Yk baar indian law ko dekh lena aadmi aur aurak ke liye kya hai fir aapko maloom chalega ki equlity ke nam par kya mazaak chal raha hai uspe vi baat karna jaruari hai.
"you know, what I never thought a male would ever be able to understand this sensitive sentiment so well, this gives me a lot hope for all the boys out there and ofcourse for the girls!!"
Women have more rights than men and they still wants equality😂
I totally support femanism but the thing is say wrong is wrong thats all. Jis ladki ne cab driver ko bara fir vi friber jail gaya iska to virodh karna hoga bhai.
Plz release video on farmers protest
"Bro What about the hormones.... What about the attraction nature put in every single man for females being attractive and beautiful... Men need to learn how to respect women on the other hand there must be something that explains women their limits(like not using the benefit of natural attraction for wrong purposes or for fun)....  There is a natural way of living together in society which is accepting your roles and offering them with honesty. Extremism in both cases is worst thing and balance is important. Women is physically different from men which means they are meant for different things. If anyone wants the peace and stability of environment then instead of ""equalization"" there must be ""assignations"" of rules and regulations. The government should provide with facilities in which women work mostly with females and do tasks which they can do better than man.... There should be some kind of education which teaches every gender their role and their limits.... Feminism even proper one will just disturb the society in negative way... Rights which you are talking about will just allow some middle class teen age boys and girls to take wrong benefits like enjoying this like independencey(which is actually running away from restrictions that are meant for their peace and discipline) which is also happening in European countries and will just increase chaos in society.... Actual problems will remain at their places.... You need some practical life in a giant family to understand all this ......"

I was hoping to see some thoughts on the topic of how women's are using there feminist rights in the wrong way and thats the reason today's generation are turning into alpha males you didn't speak on this topic.
Saved 15 minutes of my time. Since i stopped mid video. This is pure shit. Shit from the anus.

"If feminism is only about having equal rights then we don't need it, because you cannot name a single legal right that a man has and a woman does not.

The sad truth is that the only people who really need feminism are the poor souls who don't even know that this word exists. We already have equal rights in this country, but they don't know that."

"Mene to ladi imagine kri thi 
Lagta h vichardhara samaj k vipreet chal rhi h 😂"
Maturity is when you realise that a person will always give a   slight upper hand to the gender/race they belong to.
"The video is really not addressing the real upliftment or empowerment of the women, it's like any other feminist propaganda video.
1) The normative bias or framework doesn't exist for men? people don't talk about ideal men? - these qualities are ""preferable"", that doesn't make anyone not having such quality as lesser human, it's just not preferred. 
2) Why it can not be a proud choice of a woman to be a homemaker? How's a woman not subscribing to being a homemaker is any better?
3) The whole video is an exaggeration of how Boys are being treated in the society - we are not at all treated in the way video is describing. The patriarchal survived because it has the potential to lead the society - matriarchal did exist, in a lot of anthropological societies - it simply couldn't survive. The current status of patriarchy borrows a lot more credibility  from history, evolution, civilisation, wars etc. Leave it naturally, the system which is capable of leading the society would automatically survive - why there's a moral schooling around it.
4) Of course the examples which are given are basis the statements who pretend to be flag barer of Feminism, is it not the responsibility of feminist camp, to disassociate with Neha Dhupia - and give a clarification? 
5) Sudha Murthy - A character who shall be worshiped for empowering and a true feminist - she is the one who discards the toxic feminism. 
6) Bashing patriarchy doesn't really helps in selling feminism. The whole point, that Patriarchy and Feminism are standing against each other is itself flawed - they are the ideas which complements each other."

"If Animal is against women then what about The Game Of Thrones ? Gangs of Wasseypur?
Animal is a film where the protagonist has so much complexities, problems. Not a 'Hero'. The problem arises because it's acted by Ranbir Kapoor. We always think him as a hero."
"I have been watching your videos Dhruv  since way back and you have been mostly successful in communicating the topics presented in them, but this video did not do its thing atleast for me, the topic you presented here with such easiness and straight-forwardness is dangerous... the topic itself is more complicated. I lean more with the views presented by Dr. Jordan Peterson in most of his talks because he's able to communicate the message of equality between both the genders while acknowledging proper differences based on years of research, trends and human behavior and human anatomy. Today it felt like this video of yours was completely opinionated while trying to please a section of society or maybe this video needed more.... This is my first ever comment on your channel because I felt like I should share this thought."
Good job n nice topic God bless you
T shirt 1 videos 10+ amazing sir
"The problem with feminism is that it advocates for equality ONLY if and when it benefits women. It attaches 0 accountability for women.
Feminism ends when the bill arrives.
Men still are required to adhere to their traditional roles and have good jobs, house, assets, etc ; while women can have all benefits of being women without having to adhere to any traditional gender roles"
If both woman ( wife) and man (husband) both are doing work and earning then the husband shall do house chores but if man is earning and women is not she has no right to ask her husband to do household work or appoint a maid and vice versa.
Real truth is feminism is cancer.
इसका साला थोबडा हि मनहूस है

"Bro feminist nam sein bhi inki ego hurt ho Rahi hain. Mat bano yar feminist accha insaan ban jao rest you can call yourself whatever you want to. Being feminist is not important meaning behind is. First of all ye patriarchal, feminist ye sab ki zarurat hi nahi honi chahiye thi humans should have been intelligent enough to give equal rights to everybody but since humans work on power and ego this was not achieved hence the terms were needed to coin. Dhruv's work was to give information and he did rest depends on people how they consume because accepting something which requires you to give something takes a lot of effort and understanding (here RESPECT)👍🏻"

"I see it this way:
Everyone is not same, it's a fact

Male = more masculine dominant --> SURVIVAL: physical strength(fight), work(earn money)

Female = feminine dominant ---> aesthetics, theatre, music, expression 


If masculine is body then feminine is soul.
BOTH ARE NEEDED. ONE COMPLETES THE OTHER. Each has it's own place."

Current Reality: because we are still in the process of decolonisation. We do have certain people who are like hard rock. Awareness & laws needs to be worked."

I hope everyone understands this video. Please put aside the offence and try to understand this video
"Man and women are not equal but it does not mean that man can suppress them. This is wrong and the wrong has been done through out the human history . You accept it or not … by nature man and women are not equal , girls never seek security from girl they always seek security from man whenever there is treat to their  life. Man seeks stronger man’s security when there is a treat . When women got pregnant , by nature they need months of rest and care from other … they are many other aspect that man are on upper hand by nature but again it does mean man can suppress  them  . Man and women go hand  to hand but man has to take the lead… women need even man’s support to rose   the voice on feminism … in conclusion , we are not different but also not same …"

"Bhai Aisa hai to Ladke bhi apne sapne apna passion follow karna chahte hain
Lekin family ki wellbeing aur needs ke liye unhe bhi to apna sapna chodna padta aur pasand na honewala kaam karna padta hai
Patriarchy ka sirf Ladkiyan shikaar nhi Ladke bhi shikaar hain
Wo alag baat hai koi ladka in chizon ko khuleaam bolta nhi aur isse apni responsibility samajhke karne lagta hai
Aur mere hisaab(in my opinion) Ladkiyon ko bhi issi Patriarchy ka hi hissa ban na padega 
Warna jaha koi ladka apne sapno ko qurban karke family ko aage rakhe waha wo ladki bhi apne family ko aage kyu na rakhe"
Bhai mard aurat bhagwan ne alag alag banaya hi hai aur insaan har cheez adopt kar leta usko takhlif nhi hoti koi struggles nahi hote.. aurat ko aese hi accept karne do aur aadmi ko bhi uske elevated responsibilities accept karne do.. aurat kamzor hoti physically isliye usko us hisab se responsibilities di jaati hai aur mardo ko unke hisab se. Agar sab equal ho gaye to iska matlab bhai tu bhi acting shuru kar de.. jo tujhe nhi aati wo karna shuru kar.. bhai isse productivity loss hota hai.. ek mard bache nahi samhal sakta aur agar mard bache samhalega to aurat kya rickshaw chala paegi?
Thank U dhruv for depicting a very truth side of feminism. Salutation to u and ur reasearch team.
Bro got noo topics so copying from other youtubers
We want video on farmers protest❤
Dhruv ka dimag kharab hogaya hai...
Equality can never exist . Because ultimately it's a question of power and power can't be donated it has to be earned irrespective of gender. If someone works hard to achieve a position and others finds it provocative  then they need to grow up. Equal rights chillane se equality nahi aata.
There's a war going on ;when are you going to make a video on that; 2 months back you have made a video on that topic ; it's not enough ;  I was expecting  some critical opinion from your side ; i m really disappointed.
"Comment section is full of women or girls..
Really?? they want equality and freedom like a men or boys?"
Ye leftist hai no 1 or leftist feminist mile hue hai emotionally kese khelna hai isko PTA hai genders laws ka ka Jo misuse hua hazaro Mard ki life Barbad Hui uspe q nhi bola feminism ke naam pe Jo equal rights se kb kill all men ho jayega PTA nhi chalega or settle ladhka bhok bhi de to suhana lgta hai q ki kisi ladhke ladhke ke liye koi dream girl nhi AA rhi use hi Charming prince bnna hoga

Very nice video 👌👌👌👌👍🏼
In Islam no rights for women 😢
too much AI usage
Why he change thumbnil ❤
"While talking about feminism it's disappointing why he didn't talk about lgbtqia+ too, it could have provided a more clearer lens to know what feminism talks about and upholds. Another thing which is as ridiculous as macho men's criticism of feminism, is Dhruv Rathee himself using the popular slur 'chhapri' to address toxic, masculine men, you guys should have studied more about India's caste genealogy and know where these slurs come from. Chhapris are a lower caste community who existed for longer in Indian society than internet opposition of feminism came."
I'm watching his video from last 2 years and My respect is increasing for Dhruv Rather day by day
dhruv bhaiyaa you are fantastic as always
"The prime difference between a men and a women is their physic other than this everything is approx  similar or same!
It is natural difference and every women understand this no need to throw up your thoughts!"
Well I don't agree with Dhruv on this issue. Lots of fallacies in arguments. I wonder what rights men have today that women don't. On the contrary women have lots of privileges today( rightfully so to uplift women ). People are good and bad irrespective of gender.
❤
शानदार
Bhai santiago flight 513 vali video banavo 🙏
I don't support today's feminism ....I support men and women both.🙏
Bro changed thumbnail twice
I just love Dhruv❤❤
"my mother and my elder sister had taught me well abt this and i agree with u bro !! So, boys and girls lets hustle hard and lets make ourself strong lets fuckin goooo !!! cheers💗💗💗😇😇"
Dhruv I do agree with you and you have been my main and probably the best source of information I do believe that I am a feminist but some parts of the video you might have interpreted some things wrong about the males mental health and men's rights I would like to research on this topic from a different perspective involving a little history to it
"Why Don't you quote other Religion, why only Hinduism."
@dhruvrathee sir Dr br Ambedkar kar bhi faminest the aur Equalest bhi the 💯🙏🏻
right
chapri gaga 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Then why feminist are not coming out and raising voice against men taking part in Ukraine Russia war when Ukrainian govt told women to leave the country and men to stay and fight.  It’s is totally against right of women they should also given chance to fight for their country here I didn’t see any so called feminists raising their voice whyyy?????
Why aren't you making a video about   the genocide going on Gaza by Israel a terrorist state
Wao 💞
This is the real meaning of feminism
Best word for them is CHAPRI......
"Exactly 8:42 ""Women are being enemy of womens"" same happening with the woman today, one society of womens wants to study uplift themselves but other wants to degrade then and want to be in comfort zone, for example most women doesn't wants to wear hijab but there's some women are fighting against it. Idk what's happening to society these days,"

"There are certain questions in my mind...
Please help me with them
1-   Is there any kind of job category in which women are not allowed  in today's world ?(as we are talking about equal job opportunity) 
2- In India, Is there any kind of elections in which women are not allowed to vote or they don't have right to vote ?(if we are talking about equal right to vote)
3- If we are talking about equal wages provided for a particular job..( example :  if women are  working for a job like 12 hours and men are working for the same job like 14 hours and producing more output then  ....I think whoever produces more better and good output for a company should receive more wages irrespective of their gender)

If I am wrong please correct me...your thoughts on this are highly respected and appreciated."

"Thumbnail देख कर खुशी हुई चलो dhruv ने इस topic पर वीडियो बनाया। बहुत लेट कर वीडियो बनाने में। 
(1) Men's issues को लेकर Indian law में क्या हो रहा है इसकी तो कोई बात करी ही नहीं।
(2) दहेज उत्पीड़न, बलात्कार छेड़खानी जैसे झूठे आरोप लगाकर कैसे कुछ औरतें पैसे ऐंठ रही है और निर्दोष आदमी जेल में बंद हैं।
(3) नए कानून भारतीय न्याय संहिता में आए पुरुष विरोधी कानूनों की कोई बात ही नहीं करी।
(4) आज पुरूषों खासकर के शादीशुदा पुरूषों के आत्महत्या की कोई बात ही नहीं करी।
(5) महिलाओ का feminism का सहारा लेते हुए पब्लिकली बिना किसी कारण निर्दोष आदमियों को पीटना, मां बहन की गालियां देना सब ये fake feminism का ही नतीजा है।
बस महिलाओ को पीड़िता, बेचारी बेसहारा दिखा कर पूरा video बना डाला। क्या भाई तुमसे ऐसी उम्मीद नहीं थी।

Watched the whole video but got disappointed."
Ye video Puri India me sab tak pohonch ne chahiye
This video is my for studying the hole night
Words learned: Matriarchy and normative conformity
💕😍I absolutely loved this video! I am a feminist myself and I get super mad when these alpha males compare us with the fake Bollywood feminists!!!!! I hope they watch this video and get some sense into their heads 🤯
This video changed my mindset thank you sir  😊
"Dhruv g, agar aurat barabar hai... Toh apki video, apki wife kyu nahi bnati🎉🎉"
"Thumbnail 😢 Dekhr aaya tha, Pr Video worth it tha pr mai 12Th mai bhi Hu Exam sir pe hai mao Kya kar raha 💀"
Totally 👍
You guys can imagine...in a  relationship the girl is working and the boy is unemployed...and the second thing is that the boy is working and the girl is unemployed so tell me the mindset of both of them what they are thinking
"My personal understanding is the environment you live in. As a woman I was never forced to have a career nor put in that conditioning that I had to be house bound. It was a matter of choice. 
However I do feel we need to have skills. Education isn't just about having a job. 
You may need to know how to drive and run your house which involves accounting. File your own return blah blah. 
I know friends who don't work and it's a common understanding with their husbands and I know friends who do work. I don't believe in feminism. Am not an extremist of any sort."
"Salman rushidie is not a legendary writer . He is a bigot and an  islamaphobe . His book satanic verses is a clear example of hate speech and his intolerance against muslims. 
Using his quotations as basis of an argument, seems to me _ unfair."
"My simple question is if patriarchal ideology is destroying the life of men and women in our society, how you can say that feminism will not affect the same to the men and women also in the same way and it will not result in what you have mentioned about negative effects of patriarchal ideology?? But i think promoting feminism will effect more adversely  on our society along with the patriarchal ideology. I am neither supporting Patriarchal  nor feminism ideology. But i think its nonsense discussing all these things and illogical blind promotion of any such like ideologies. Nature has given some characteristics and responsibility to both of the masculine creatures, we should fulfill it."
"Perfect! Everything is perfectly organised and will clear so many doubts of people. I also have learned so many things from this video, I used to take the feminist word as an insult or a taunt as most of the people of my group believe in patriarchy. But now I can proudly say that I'm a feminist. I'm a brother, a son and a boyfriend and I'm really lucky that my close ones believe in positive sides about feminism and appreciate every work of the feminists 😇"
"Why do you use the word ""Chhapri""?  Isn't that wrong?"
Broo sirf Dhruv rathee he itna sach bol sakta hai
"I took a stand for Animal, against Feminism.. & Dhruv made video, VOW😂😂"

If half the members of our species aren't given equal opportunity. Then humanity can't grow to its full potential.
Bhai kisano ke bare mai video bnao
You are a very informative and knowledgeable person.but sometimes I don't agree with you bcoz our thinking is not similar.
This is what we expect from dhruv rathee❤
I got many things wrong in this video
"but associating everything with gender equality is not the solution like a woman can do 90%of the things a man can but does she have to it depends if men do the hardwork in the society then how can share the reward equalyy??
its easy to just take one aspect and get views instead of the broader picture"
Oo kya news de rahe hai aap... current world 🌎 International relations provide kijiye ...???????
Love you miaaan
This man is trying to fix the society by Pointing out the obvious.
❤❤❤❤❤ All hearts for Dhruv❤
You changed the point of view about feminism ❤❤thank you sir!!!
The berozgar thing really hit me 😂 I did imagine an unemployed youth!
Q aj kal job ki Kami h is par ek video
Video #1 Trending
Muslim girl ke bare me kyo nahi bolte ho 😡😡
Exactly maine aise bht time dekha h jaha girls sahi hoti hein Or piche se koi ek uthta h whi purani ghisi hui words use krte huye are larki kuch bhi kre mgr lerka hi glt hota h... For kuch lerki bhi use lerki ko or glt thera deti h qki unhe apne apko acha or us bhir ka hisa bna hota h... Aisi bht chiz dekhi h maine
I don’t know why but I didn’t find this video completely logical. I want to debate with Dhruv on this topic but I know it’s not possible for him to do this but I wish if it happens I can surely prove him wrong.

"Equality toh milni chahiye besak, but healthy and positive equality honi chahiye, jaise education , job, freedom of healthy expression, and talks etc, but har jagah equality nahi ho sakti for eg: ek boy raat ko 12 bajah kahi se ghar aaye woh thik hai kyuki raaste me uske saat jyada se jyada kiya hi ho jayega , bas paise wagera loot lenge but ek girl ke saat bohot kuch bura ho sakta hai, iska matlab ye nahi ki girls ko raat me ghumne ki azadi nahi milni chahiye but duniya bohot gandi hai, aor ek baap , ek bhai ek pati  uske safety k liye aisa karte hai, ha jis din ram raaj aa jaye oos din beshak ful freedom milni chahiye......."
"You have my respect 🩷
God bless you"
Can Someone Tell which Right Man have but Women Don't have. As per out constitution.

What to tell a woman who just wants money from her partner and stay with her parents. Feminist or patriarchal.
Like if you like when Dhruv se chapri gang 😂
"Dhruv  sir your are a real hero ❤

Aur jis din har insaan ke pass ap jesi soch aa gyi uss din puri duniya badal jaygi😎😎😘"
Kya Tumne usko legend kaha
👏👏👏👏👏
Who Support Radical Feminism.......?
I truly agree with him ...serials and films of today are so patriarchal that I feel that cartoons are better. Too much of patriarchy is ingrained in our society and we consume it all subconsciously..and thus we are impacted adversely!!
"Why are only hindu puran, hindu women used as examples? Why not use Muslim, Christian texts, cases as examples where women are treated much worse than hindu women? These are small things that effect the viewer, a hindu boy or girl might watch this and think Hinduism is against women equality. People Dhruv always have some agenda against certain groups hidden in something positive."
"Give equal right to woman
Society will be destroyed."
I face feminism daily. E.g. If i am sitting in a sharing rickshaw and if a woman has to sit beside me then she will come from the other  side and sit besides another man sitting next to me or sit next to another woman. Provided there is another woman sitting next to me. If this is not feminism then what it is. Insult on a daily basis.
Very informative as usual. Actually so many people don't know the concept. Thank you
"In the last 2 examples about the Lucknow incident and Neha Dhupia, did any of the feminist come to aid the guy. Did any of the feminist criticize Neha for her hypocrisy.  Well there  are many more instances in this video where it is clear that he is manipulating his audience. Dhruv bhai......manipulate karna to koi tuse sikhe   😞😞"
It's Easier to Fool People Than It Is to Convince Them That They Have Been Fooled
Again thank you dhruv sir . 😊
Kya bhai mai kuch achha sikhne aaya tha or tu hag rha hai😢
Right choices for alpha male 😂
"okay if there should be equall rights can a man slaps back a woman if she slaps a man, or use abusive language or try take advantages of being a woman should a man response back equally ?"

Ab jo ladkia samjhdaar haii wo sab already ladko ke barabar kam kar rhi hai. Auur kchh pgll haii jo  online pe feminism feminism krti rehti hai with a toxic mentality"
Men and Women are never 'EQUAL'. Both has their proper rights but not EQUAL rights.

"Even i am a feminist and firmly believe in equality of both the genders, 

I believe If a man can rape ..A woman can rape too

I believe if a woman can be a victim of domestic violance ...A man can be in such state too

I believe if there are incidents of eve teasing...things like adam teasing exist too

I believe if dowry is wrong...alimony is equally wrong too

Yes i am a feminist & i am a supporter of  equality 🙏🙏"

"Sir many times we get to listen that the front person used me (whoever that can be friend, family member or relative). On the contrary, another fact also appears that a human helps a human. Can you make a vdo on this topic whom to help or how to protect oneself from getting used? A humble request! 🙏"
Ek content politics mein banaa dijiye darte hain kya
Please video on sandeshkhali incident west bengal
"Nice video. There should be equal rights for men and women. However, this imbalance comes from the system, law of the land also. As far as equal rights are concerned, the law treats men and women differently and it fuels the alpha men thought when there is discrimination done with men. E.g. Almost always Men are guilty until proven innocent whereas women are innocent until proven guilty."
Very well explained 👍🏻
Problem was never about giving equality it was about mentality first we struggle to change men's mentality about women now because of that women in west and some places here they feel they are superior problem is about Mentality

"As u showed the definition of feminism, do people know that, people think feminism means women above men, alpha women(this is reason for most controversies). But as u said, feminism isn't about women being on top, instead giving equal opportunities for both men and women. This was a great video .
Could u make a video on multiple genders, LGBTQ+++ etc. Is that real issue ?
a great fan from Karnataka."
Great sir
"15:15 at this point i disagree coz in my friend circle we share all our problems and everybody helps each other , (even emotionally)

Once again dhruv proved how manipulatuve he is and how in every video be tries to divert the actual issue.

Loved your nuanced analysis!

Simp will be simp
Finally he's also diagnosed with feminism😅
"Men:
Strength (larger muscles)
Speed (stronger muscles = more propulsion)
Durability (better bone structure)
Endurance >= (varies on what activity is being
done, but in a fight it likely goes to the dudes)
Stamina (larger heart and lungs = more
Oxygen intake)
Women:
Combat (can exploit the weak-point of a
man's balls)
Weapons (often carrying purses, wearing
heels and possibly heavy jewelry, even
hairpins to stab with)
Endurance <= (smaller muscles require less
oxygen)
Equalities:
X
IQ and BIQ (nothing makes a man nor woman
more intelligent than the other)
Skill (yes,men are involved in acquiring more skills than women)"

"I call myself a feminist but making a whole video on it and not addressing the common issues faced by feminist men of today is hypocritical(eg man has to pay on the first date, DIVORCE laws, child custody, false alligations etc etc). You gave examples of the simplest issues out there - ones that no one can debate or talk about. You took the easiest way out.
And saying 'not a real feminist' has become today's 'not a real man'. who is distributing the certificate? where is the line being drawn?  Actions are happening under that banner. So ignoring and saying that 'they' do not belong to this pure, ideal group doesn't cut it.
I concede that you highlighted what feminism should be but A big channel like you should have called out more double standards and addressed the issues faced by non-'chapri' men as well."
Mene khud ko imagine kiya 😂😂
Indian society all country 😅on the earth
This vid won my heart. You nailed it. Dhruv!

"Bullshit theory. Just manipulating the facts according to needs. They can only see the greater men number in politics and not on the border . When there is a danger situation , they remind gender roles and hide in the nutshell. Do not influence men wrong . If future generation really get into emotional drama and stop working on themselves then tough Men from west are ready to take over.  Rights are already equal in constitution and opportunities are based on excellence."
Unsubscribing...this man has lost it...not doubting the content of his videos...just the quality of topics he chooses these days...just lol
dhruv you are always savage.
Haldwani par real video banaye
"In India, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had a major role in improving the status of women, he proposed Hindu Code Bill in which the rights given to women to own and inherit property, and granted daughters equal rights as sons in matters of inheritance and provided widows with a share in their deceased husband's property and many more. He always says, ""I measure the progress of a community by the degree of progress which women have achieved."""

"I think many people have wrong concept about 'feminism' because of the term itself. Since the term is derived or is similar to 'female', people think that it's about 'female superiority '. 
In my opinion it would have been better if a better teram was used to describe it. Maybe 'NORMALISM' or 'EQUALISM' will be better as the term itself indicates equality.
Idk if my opinion is a better solution or not, it's just what I feel so."
This is boring topic druve
Dhruv Rathe Johny sins of India 😂
2:06 💯
Lots of love to you and your team. Keep educating us.
Lots of love to you for this video❤️
"I completely agree with all your analogies and im not against the view you stand for. But consider this as a doubt from this 18 year old child, a person with a wheelchair chair and a completetly healthy person might differ, example quota in examinations so you can't say that they get equal rights right. Same with obc and other quotas given to groups. If the quota system goes away, then i feel you can say everyone is equal. Please do respond. If possible please do make a video about the quota system and how it affects other people who may be intellectually better. Thank you."
"Patriarchy: System of governance ran by men with more power & responsibility entrusted to men especially the ruling elites.
Feminism: Political ideology or movement centred around the female.
Masculism/Masculinism: Political ideology or movement centred around the male, in other words male version of feminism.
Matriarchy: System of governance ran by women with more power & responsibility entrusted to women especially the ruling elites, in other words female version of patriarchy.
Egalitarian: Being a supporter of Egalitarianism i.e. the idea of treating everyone with equality."
we need more men like you!
"Great points explained. Ye Jo ' patriarchy' hai ye anjane mey teen age me hi ladka ya ladki ke man mey Gus jata hai.

Jo log aapne opinion me pakka ho chuke hai inko change korna mushkil nahi namumkin hai."
As a woman i dont like feminism its full of lies and propaganda.
Woww Just WOWW!!! ❤❤
Revolutions happen due to discrimination and unequality. Feminism is a revolution. We are in the process it will work one day when we will get equal rights and not be treated like some other species.

"All is about ""log kya kahenge"" , dont know why log sirf dushre kya kahenge uss pe hi depend karte h, all are humans , sab ke pas emotions h , sabko wahi krna chahiye jo unka man kare . Dushro ke baato pe bilkul dhyan nhi dena chahiye. Insaan akela aya h ,akele hi jayega ,aur jitna din jiyega kya sirf dushre kya kahenge uss pe ? , kehne do koi kya hi kehta h . Insaan bano , aur apni life khud ke marji se jio. Life is short , dont waste your time by listening all these stuff"
Very bad content. Seems not matured
"Feminism's name has been tainted by the west, especially the privileged people that have everything in life but they want to be the victim, they overused terms like girl power and patriarchy for justifying their spoiled behaviour, whereas till this day in Middle East and in India there are still a lot of women and girls who wanted to be something but cannot raise their voice due to the environment set around them and unfortunately the privileged feminists of big cities are not going to be a big help for any of them."
❤❤❤❤

Basically feminism is not wrong but feminist are wrong who promote sexuality and LGBT like things in our community that's why a lot of people are against feminist.......like they demand that women will also go outside without a top like men and their are a lot of demands which are against our culture and religion and you people will observe these days the immodesty in Bollywood and feminist are promoting these things.....
"Please don't confuse men, just let the females be confused 😂"
Totally disagree with your video today.women never can be equal to men .they have different roles. Women have been getting privilege all the time.they are also  getting almost all the rights in democratic countries.
A very enlightening video on what feminism really is. This must be watched by everyone who thinks that feminism means oppressing or objectifying or going against men.
Is video ko dekh kr momino ke bhurkhe fat  gye..... 😂😂

"Feminism has come a long way since its inception, challenging societal norms and advocating for gender equality and justice. While it has its advantages and disadvantages, feminism has undeniably made significant progress towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society. By recognizing the contributions and struggles of women, we can continue working towards a world where gender does not limit one's opportunities or dictate their worth."
"You talked about Patriarchy in blacks ,whites, indians, christians. Even vedas and puran, but what i am thinking about is why have you not talked about extreme patriarchy in islam where women can't take their single life decisions and are oppressed to an unimaginable extent. Sharias and what they think about Patriarchy. He didn't talk about islamic mindset on women not even once. If you present something present it in a full-fledged manner."

"Dear Dhruv sir please make a video on Sandeshkhali Violence, we want justice...🙏"
"First of all the Indian law doesn't seem to believe in women empowerment, or think they can be independent, all they do is choose to view them in innocent, victim perspectives. Many recent cases are evident where the wife is getting paid alimony despite the fact that she is committed to an extra marital affair, in some cases the wife is draining the husband physically and mentally. Though she is literate, earning good for herself, she demands alimony. When they are physically fit and audacious enough to file a false case without any fear that they may get punished, why can't they continue to do the job earn bread & butter for themselves and split the children's financial responsibility, if they believe in feminism. Why no feminist is opposing it, it's clear the women with such cases are demoralising the spirit of feminism. In my opinion considering the recent cases, I feel that some of the Indian judges deliberately choose to be ignorant.

I believe there should be gender neutral laws, no matter which gender committed the crime should be punished.

Dear @dhruv rathee I request you to make an informative video on such cases and how some Indian judges are demoralising feminism."
"Dear Dhruv sir please make a video on Sandeshkhali Violence, we want justice...🙏❤"
"today I am unfollowing Dhruv rathee for what he actually explained about feminism..... (he have not mentioned the consequences that a girl and his family had to suffer when a girl brutally ra***d by Some toxic and inhuman character male , just because of their male ego  when any girls shows feminism infront of them and sometimes even hurt and slaps man , trying to showoff the power of a woman.... 

Hello , Dhruv rathee have you ever thought of this all no never .... because you don't live in India then how will no this all ..."

Yrr bhai aap to sabke ladai jagde khamt kr doge😂
As I am female I totally agree with Dhruv rathee video
Jab AP ki videos let hoti ha to dil se bura ladta ha bhai
"Yeh aadmi har baar ghum phir kar ""JANTA JITNE WALI BAAT HI KARTA HAI"" arre Mr apko pata bhi hai ladkiyo ko Aaj ki date mein kanoon se kitni power mil chuki hai, aur jyadatar ladkiyan power ka miss use kar Rahi hai...  Pata nahi kiski beti ko khush karna chahta hai yeh banda.( Dhrub rathee= shubham mallik) The number of fake cases registered for harassment and domestic violence by women are somewhere close to 98% as Shonee kapoor suggested and in all likelihood this represents the actual number for the proportion of false cases as I explain it here:
Well first of all we need to understand that all Women related laws and especially dowry related laws are non-bailable and cognisable. That means cases can be registered against husbands without any kind of evidence being provided by the accuser-women and the husband is also arrested immediately and put in jail until he gets a bail.
When feminists do not use logic while registering the cases and in all publications they only cite the number of cases registered, knowing fully well that cases are registered even where there is not an iota of evidence then it is quite surprising to see how they seek to apply logic only when it is convenient to them for proving the statistics are wrong.
When a law is non-bailable which means police are allowed to do investigation and cases are registered entirely based on a written statement by the accuser and without any evidence. And if even after all these provisions, if the prosecution is not able to prove their case then why should it not be then deemed that the case itself was a false one to begin with.😮"

"Sir कई बार मैं feminism के बारे मे search किया और समझा लेकिन mai hmesha भूल जाती थी 
Kyuki हमारे aas पास yaisa माहौल है ki jaha अपने लिए bolne का अधिकार नहीं है और kaai बार मैं घर me और दोस्तों को और होने वाले husband को समझाने की कोशिश की लेकिन mujhe उलझा dia gya 

En sab दे जीने की इच्छा नहीं होती है 

शादी नहीं krna chahti Kyuki घर me मैं सबसे बड़ी hu और mujhe लगता है कि मुझे bahot sari जिम्मेदारियां   निभाना है Kyuki मानवता yaisa krne ki सहमति दे रहीं hai 

इसे मैं अपना अधिकार समझती हूं इसी मैं यैसा करुँगी 

आपके इस वीडियो ने mujhe लोगों को जवाब देना सीखा दिया

Great man ❤❤
👍 always learning...thanks ...Dhruv..
Very nice video😊
"The only point I disagree here with Dhruv
Is supporting the right and condemning the wrong is a complete process.
The so called feminist should condemned the incident where a woman slapped a driver. And not the other way round to say ohh they didn’t say anything so they didn’t support guess what common sense says one should not beat anyone yet there would be people thinking it is justifiable in the name of feminism. To such people it is important for the influencers(feminist) to openly condemn so that stupids can somehow know from others what is right or wrong as their own common sense is a failure"

किसान के बारे मे Video बनाईए ।।
Perfect explanation. Explained everything so well but there’s one point I want to add on…it’s not only males who don’t know the exact meaning of feminism but also the females. Everybody need to educate themselves about feminism so that boys can’t blame of any girl who doesn’t know the exact meaning of feminism and so it doesn’t become an issue or an opportunity to let them down.
"I have some confusions about feminism for example in our metro, trains, buses there are reserved seats for females but females are allowed to sit on seats which are not reserved for them where as if a male asks a female to vacate the seat for him although the reserved seats are available the females get aggressive and violent when this matter goes to police station or to the court due to a violent scene happened the police or the court taken female side saying that as a equal rights she can sit on any suitable place but a male cannot violet or can't be violent to occupy a seat which is reserved for females
Secondly please read about filing a case for domestic violence in which only females can file the case and males cannot
These are just an examples for your research
I am not against equality for any gender but when our judiciary teaches us like these examples and there are no signs of alternatives can we really appreciate or follow for the thoughts of feminism ?
As a human we learn everything by our surroundings and if we see discrimination since our childhood against any gender by any person, society, government or judiciary system we cannot be feminist

Actually many males are feminist but they are not aware of that ...and what these males hate and mock is toxic feminism ...not the real one because there are many men who are actually feminist and awareness is spreading day by day
"Are feminism and women empowerment separate things? 
You didn't touch how much power our legal system have given to women also how often men suffers from it."
"Hey Dhruv, I think you should make a video about the farmers in India who are being brutalized by the army and are protesting for their rights. That seems like a more urgent topic than feminism right now. 🙏"
DHRUV👏❤
Whenever KuKu Fm feels sale is going down they just contact dhruve 😂
👏👏
14:20 😂😂
"I appreciate @dhruv to bring more clarity into feminism.
If feminism mean equal opportunity to both men & women then
1. why women are given priority over men by granting them reservation in private & govt. Sector??
2. Why women are given financial benefits like land reg. Concession, tax concession, scholarships etc.

I think from my perspective most of the men wants equal rights for women but not at their expense. Even after that no one even acknowledges the men's contribution. That's why men usually get annoyed talking about feminism.

Also,

1. Men too are victim of patriarchal mindset but they usually dont react every small thing but they fight & overcome the issue.
2. Why the hell women need to attack on men everytime, they are ones who are now able to work at equal just because of efforts of men as well. But what men are the villians in the end. 

I just wanted to share what a man might feel. They want women to be equal but even they are victim themselves, helping women but all they recieve is abuse."

Very Informative and very well explained 👍👍👍
"Question asked : 
Is feminism destroying indian society? 
(Note: i am not a anti feminist. I support the feminist movement but not the modern unhinged version of it) 
Toxic femininity mentioned... (Forgets about it just after mentioning it) 
Talks every point positive of feminism. (Forgets about all the negatives) 
Blames patriarchy. 
Mentions male loneliness... Blames patriarchy. 

Says non feminist females have 'norm conformity' 
(Isnt being feminist a norm in today's generation..then are you also a norm conformist) 
Blames patriarchy again.

Mentions some events which people labled 'toxic female' (neha dupia and women hitting cab driver) diverts and starts bashing chapri alpha males of social media. (Dude come on! I dont think there exists a better way to show your bias) 


My personal points: 
If you watch a lot of youtube shorts you may have come across a youtube creator who is a lawyer. He makes shorts on the gender bais towards women in the indian law. 

There's gender inequality but not on the women's side its on the men's side. 
If you so called feminists do believe feminism to be a word for 'gender equality' and not 'female superiority' then why dont we ever see feminists fight to make the law equal for both the genders. 

When men try to fight for their rights they're 'Toxic males' but when privileged women fight for rights they already have and even so want more. Its suddenly 'female impowerment. ' 
There's still great amount of women suffering in the rural areas. But their problem has already been given a solution. Its just that they either dont know of it or it hasn't reached them yet."

Sir  i am very excited for your next video and Thenx for information 😅😅😅😅😅
"I don't think that occasionally being aggressive is patriarchal , being rude is patriarchal, being short is patriarchal, being jobless is patriarchal, its all because men are mostly found with strong will power, a demonstration to elaborate ""a sawt always has lion to protect while lioness look after the other necessities"" that doesn't mean that the sawt is following the ideology of feminism or patriarchy, that's all management nothing else in the end animals are more intelligent"
"Dhruv, hats off to you for bringing this to light. This is such a reality of our society. Real feminism is about removing patriarchy for both women and men 🙌"
"i just want to ask that agar kisi feminist ne support nahi kiya lucknow wale case mein and neha dhupia wali baat pe , to oppose bhi to nahi kiya , if feminism is getting equal rights to boys and girls to equally react karo na agar koi ladka vaisa karta jo ki galat hai to saare feminist uske khilaf awaz uthate , jo ki sahi hai . but ladki ne kiya to nahi kiya shows ki ideology ye hai ki karo koi rokega nahi........."
I've been seeing so many videos regarding 'Toxic feminism' where they've been talking about bollywood movies promoting 'Toxic feminism' where they don't even get into the real meaning of feminism and are only talking about the negative sides but this video was totally different where Dhruv explained the meaning of feminism and related it to tons of shits going around irl not only stupid movies . These other youtubers really need to get their job done properly lol dhruv is just too good
Bjp is behind of toxic feminist
Thanks for making  knowledgeable videos. Please make a video on electoral bond

"Feminism is men and women right(Liberty,Equality and political right) not only female perspective.The main problem is  our religion tell us female are weak,narrow minded.Till now is the best video for our society ,they should know feminism is not patriarchal type thing it is a ideology ,which tell us men and women are equal not that men superior to women."

Neena gupta was talking about idiotic feminism
"I often have generalized men as selfish and violent, because growing up, I hadn't seen any good epitome of a man, I had only seen them disrespect women. I faced sexual abuse as a kid by some guy, by a cousin too, I saw my father disregard my mother, even most of the guys in my class were just downright disgusting and immature. I can't help but feel like all men are same, even tho a rational part of knows we can't generalize a whole gender but Dhruv, men like you have regained my trust, and given me hope that there's good people out there."
11:21 I imagined you
"females vouching for feminism will be the first one to leave a man if he is crying or demean him if he is earning less (just like men demean women in their houses bcz they earn more or only they are earning). You can change the Society but not these damn double standard Humans. Try to find one girl who chooses a Feminist Man in her life at first. Nope they wont. 1st they will get emotionally & Physically abused by a Toxic Man/Some Toxic Men & Later they will choose a feminist for their comfort, they wont show the necessary respect their partner, the same respect they want being a feminist.  Come to Real World Guys."
"Yup, actually women are the main enemy of women"
Your videos help me to get out of depression i have a lot of things to discuss with u

"How sensible argument Dhruv bhaiya..
It's Such an important topic..
Thank you for discussing it with care and sensitivity..
I hope people learn things from this.. 
That women stood against women's rights, got to learn it from this video..

But modern feminists atleast in America can be toxic

Thanks man
"i love my daughter, my wife and my mother, it doesn't mean Men are equal to Women, that's why we have 2 different words to identify ... regarding rights ... it can never be ""Equal"", yes certainly it MUST be Equitable. .. grow up Dhruv."
"Despite agreeing with all the points you mentioned in the video, I do have to point that the vagueness in the civil/criminal laws of the country skews towards women with a bias, mostly considering the man to be in the wrong when the proof is inconclusive. This has caused an increase in misuse of the laws by some which make some men invalidate the actual issues other women face. Plus there's no substantial consequence for a woman when there's a misuse of said laws. Hence, I feel it fuels this divide between men and women."
Kisano ke aandolan pe video banaiye sir. Godi media kahi nahi dikha raha hai
"Thanku dhruv rathee ❤🔥 This video, really gives true and clear picture about feminism. Feminism is all about encouraging equality of political, social and economic rights between male and female.Thanku dhruv rathee❤🎉🎉🌼🌼🎊🔥🔥"
Bro you nailed it❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Dhruv, although what you said is true, you also missed the point that real feminism is not truly being followed by our society. Not only the ""alpha males"" of the comment section, but also the so-called wannabe ""feminists"" who twist the meaning of real feminism. In my opinion, you should have dug deeper into this because people notice people like this more than real feminists and tend to follow their path."
Very impressive topic for our society
Bhai alag अंग hone se kux nhi hota it's all about mindset 🙂

Feminism ko pahle main support karta tha par jab se sacchai dekhi feminist ki tab se chidh ho gai h feminist se.. actually feminist equality chahti hi nhi h woh sirf ladko ko gulam bana kar rakhna chahti h.. kabhi feminist se discuss kar k dekhna ya unke comments padhna sab pata lag jaega...  Feminism achhi chiz thi par ye feminist ab feminism k naam aatank faila rhi h... Feminist ladkiyo k ghatiya se ghatiya crime ko b justify krti h...
Dumbest analysis
abse nhi dekh rha mai teri video
"I can't thankyou enough for this particular video Dhruv. I'm a first year political science student, who faced so much criticism the moment i said I'm a feminist among my new classmates which ofcourse wasn't surprising but pretty disappointing. But that didn't stop me from giving them reasons and indulging into arguments as to why it's not a 'CANCER' (that's what they claim it is) i thought i might change their perspective for good But the saddest moment in this was, when a girl mocked me infront of those people as to 'why do i need Feminism? Don't we have equal rights, given to us by the constitution?' And i saw them giving that smug smile to show how I am the only crazy one here. 

In that moment i really wanted to ask her, ""We abolished Untouchability under Article 17 no? Then why we still see it being practiced widely across the country?"" 

But alas! I felt defeated in that moment because it was coming from a girl of my same age.

P.S. I'm gonna share this video in my class group and i dont care if they think I'm batshit crazy. ( for you gave me the courage that I've lost in bw.)"

"What about ""Matriarchy"" then? Is it acceptable or not?"
"It’s not equality you need, it’s equity what you really need. This is what makes feminism pointless. 

Equality just divide everything without considering the demand or worth of individuals. That’s why you have to follow equity to make a fair distribution of anything. You'll see women happily married with husband without job for centuries to come, same was before. But how many example you can give where wife earns and husband don’t work??? 
I agree women should get a chance to get anywhere they want but through fair competitions and tests."
Dhruv rathee is only one person on YouTube who makes us understand difficult topic in easy
No
On point🥂
Thank you for making this kind of video which keeps important lessons for our society.
Change thumbnail 😅😅😅
Dhruv's content is generally improving... pleasure to watch 💜♥️
Do you agree with reservation. Isn't it inequal
Feminism= Opportunism. They fight for equal rights but when it comes to responsibility they escape from it.

"The real problem is- many women want equal rights (full support to that), but when it comes to responsibilities they dont want equality. Great you missed that in your video but was expected."

08:27 नारीवाद जैविक भिन्नताओं के बावजूद समानता को बढ़ावा देता है।

14:44 नारीवाद पुरुषों की भावनात्मक अभिव्यक्ति और मानसिक स्वास्थ्य पर प्रभाव डालता है।

Tell me what rights are given to men and are not given to women
Andew tate wants to know your location
"Yes most men donot understand the real meaning of feminism...But  women who call themselves feminists...have you ever tried explaining your partner, friend, fiance about what real femnisim is?!...How many of you have done that?!...There are many instances of some women who go on hating the male gender, about how men are not required in society, about how they justify extramarital affairs, about how when woman earns she is independent and doesnot need to take care anyone other than herself...These women also proclaim themselves as ""feminists""...they write so in their bio, tell so in their reels...So my humble request to all the real women, real feminists out there, first try to eliminate such women from the ""feminist cricle"", then...i hope perhaps more people will support feminism in the true sense...Thank you"
To the point❤
"Then why under 498A is a girl allowed to be set free even if she has lied under oath?
And why does the girl have location advantage in a court case? 
We are already in matriarchy when it comes to judicial rights in India"
It's about not knowing the actual meaning of feminism i and I m glad that we have some wonderful men and women who are feminist and one more thing as there are some chapri boys who relate everything to feminism but we can't deny the fact that toxic feminism exist
Please make a video on kintan case a 6th grade child beated to death by seniors . By the way love your video's ❤

"A MOVEMENT IS DEFINED BY IT'S PEOPLE, NOT BY ANY DICTIONARY DEFINITION. Aaj ki society me feminism is dominated by femi-nazis it has become an ideology to hate men, rather than supporting equality, Actually as a society hume gender-equality ko gender-equality ki tarah hi dekhna chahiye, feminism, masculism, patriarchy aur matriarchy jaise shabd confusion create krte hai. Aajkal majority of the feminists ki ideology ko dekhkar agar feminism ki nai definition nikaali jaye to vo hogi -- ""ideology to hate men"". Mordern feminism females ki insecurity ka hi ek bhot bada reason hai, it's a paranoid, agar aap TV aur social media pe dekho ge ki sab aage khilaaf hai, to OBVIOUSLY aap insecure ho jao ge aur apne support me kisi movement ko join karloge fir chahe us movement ka purpose doosre group ko hate krna bhi kyu na ho. I am also against discrimination, sexism, rape, domestic violence, etc. But better if we remove the toxicity from these things and simply focus on GENDER EQUALITY. --Ritwik Dadarwal"
Like bro👍
"Dhruv 
 i am not criticizing you but i
Recently  learned that ""chapri"" Word should not be used , as it's refers to a particular cast
However i know your intentions are not promoting casteism and you are using it to express the negativity of  people 
But may be you should not use it as  
It could be used against you  (to misinterprete about you"

"This video reminds me of Jasleen Kaur and Sarvjeet case. For those who don't know, a young girl Jasleen posted a pic of Sarvjeet on Facebook stating that he had made obscene comments on her while they were amidst a traffic. The post became viral and the girl was praised for bravery. Sarvjeet was arrested. He didn't admit to the allegations claiming to be innocent. He was bashed by the netizens. Then some witnesses came forward who admitted Sarvjeet wasn't at fault. The charges at Sarvjeet were dropped after 4 years. He lost his job and couldn't find any other job. All because of false accusations made by that girl. Don't know how he is doing, but this incident is an example how feminists are misusing the laws given to them."

Nice video ❤
"I will not support you 100%, Dhruve. Males and females are not the same 100%. God created them for different work. In some work women are perfect, their men are not perfect and vice versa. People, by the name of feminism, give all the men's work to the women, and what do you gain now in this generation? More than half the percentage of divorce. Nobody wants to compromise for each other because now everyone thinks they don't need anyone since they earn money. In the middle, their kids suffer and get spoiled. The husband is a protector of the woman, but whoever tortured their wife, there should be rules and legal ways to deal with that, and the same goes for others. You never can expect when you walk with your wife, and some men are harassing her. At that time, of course, she will say you are the man; you should protect me. But men never can expect that. Of course, there is a purpose to create them differently physically and mentally.

This is why old-time family lives together. Of course, there were issues and suffering, but at least they learned to live together in the end. Somebody has the right over you in some cases; it doesn't mean that women have fewer rights. When we were kids or teens, our parents had power over us; they loved us, punished us, and disciplined us. Does it mean they were wrong? Parents and kids should have the same right to live together? Now western countries have this kind of mentality and make this rule. If their parents shout at them and even a little bit punish them, then they call the police. In this way, the young generation gets spoiled, and families get broken.

You also said the similarity between men and women. I know both of us have ears, nose, hands, and so on. But animals have that as well; similarity. Does it mean we and animals can do the same work? The main difference between humans and animals is we are intellectual. We use more brains than animals. This makes everything different and works differently. Women and men don't have the same feelings, brains, and hearts. Yes, it looks the same physically, but the way it thinks and feels is different. And that makes us different to do different work, where women are better in some cases, and males are better in other cases. We have even different choices of colors and toys from childhood. This is natural. We are making it unnatural.

Saying this, you are actually breaking society. Just remove the oppression part. Nobody should oppress each other. There is some extraordinary passion of women as well, and they can be astronauts, doctors, etc. And they still can do that. They did that before and are doing it now as well. God sets a rule as he creates humans, and he knows better how we get along. Problems happen when we each have different opinions and try to make our own rules. Just accept nature as it shows us. Women look lovely maintaining kids, houses, and families, and respect them and protect them as your wives. In the same way, men are physically stronger than women; they are good in outside work. Let them work for you. It looks sound and balanced. Just don't oppress each other. That's it."
"This video is a perfect example of what we call ""Cheery Picking Fallacy"". I used to respect this guy a lot but he lost it after animal review. That review was a great example of  ""Hasty Generalization Fallacy"", calling people mental for enjoying a movie? now that's stupid, He does have informational content on his channel and I respect that, but this guy is becoming more stupid by each day."
Right...thkuu so much ❤❤❤❤
Bas kr bhai 😂
I have never commented on any vedio on any platform till now but your explanation forced me to comment for the first time. Thanku  sir from the bottom of my heart. I am highly thankful to you for  giving  your efforts on such a debatable topic. You are  great sir.👍
Bhai feminist bana Diya ❤
"All the things you are saying are only in theory 
In reality women use feminism all over the world only to get facilities 
As you say that due to patriarchy men have the society's expectation to Earn more its actually in real life False
IN REALITY FEMINISTS NEVER MARRY A MAN WHO IS FINANCIALLY WEAKER THAN HER 
SHE WILL STILL EXPECT HIM TO DO EVERY THING A MAN DOES PLUS DO EVERYTHING A WOMEN HAS TO DO 😂😂😂😂"

Equal right means? We should remove ladies special coach from train? We should stop saying ladies first? We should not give female quota in any place? There are a lot more like these examples.

Women has one small character called fickle.. she never satisfy what she have .. she always in search of best things..  that's the reason why men keeps her in house  and not go outside.. it's one of the droupadi character in mahabharata... girls flip easily she move on easily.. that's the reason men always scared..

"The fact that most women are misled into matriarchy in the name of feminism. Moreover, there are toxic traits of both masculinity and feminism (the misunderstood one), but only masculinity is considered toxic. Patriarchy is toxic, and matriarchy is not women empowerment. Only the correct feminism should be taught and understood by both men and women."

They opposed triple talaq, they voluntarily accept parda (just for the sake of religion) , MTP rights, even Arab nations (the prosperous one) women rights are denied etc. N you are giving example which are baseless... That podcast of Nina Gupta is not against feminism u have trimmed the vedio to justify your perspective..... 😢 disappointed Dhruv Sir"

Bro uss pe bhi baat kro jo india mein feminism ke naam ka galt use keeya ja rha h abh government ne rule bnayea k agar koi ldka ldki ke sath marriage ka jhooth bol k relationship mein rehta h to baad mein ladki case kr skti h lekin agr jhi baat ladki ladke ke sath kre ton uss pe koi rule nhi je ton equality nhi hui na india mein bro jo feminism ka glt use ho rha h uspe bhi baat kro
"Enough of what ideal feminism is and how it will benefit both men and women, let's talk about what goes on in real world. Feminism and female empowerment are widely used, especially in India to justify wrongs done by women on men. ""Women have suffered for so long, men's turn now"" is a common feeling among so many Indian feminist, including men. To say that not a single feminist agreed with Neha Dhupia there is a big overstatement. There were many. There are also many who justify similar scenarios. Low paying and physically challenging jobs are never scrutinised for being male dominated, only cozy and comfy high paying office jobs have the gaze of so called feminists set on them. Ask the feminist if she'd prefer being deployed as a front line combatant at the LOC while her partner stays back at home praying for her well being. It just doesn't happen as it's not natural. Ask the feminist if he/she supports gender quotas in job market. Most would say yes and that goes directly against the feel good idea of equality. Saying women don't have a body as strong as men but have a mind that can compete with men's so they should only be expected to demand equality in office jobs is also not fair. Why should 50% men who could've potentially grabbed a high paying office job be rejected to pave way for women with similar intellectual calibre or sometimes even less just for the sake of ""numerical equality""? That's goddamn inequality. 
And btw it's not like I wish for women to start lifting guns at the LOC or start laying bricks from tomorrow. That'd be a nightmare."

Ladka ladki equal theory Mai ya ache baato Mai ho sakty hai .....ya fir yeh keh sakty hai kuch hadh tak similar hai but equal kyamat k din tak nhi ho sakty .......mere kehne ka matlab yeh nhi hai ki in Mai se  1 behtar hai bus equal ni ho sakty ....but equal right sab ko milna chahiye ...."
Mewing pe bhi ek video banao
Equality man and women sab kehne ki batain logo ko sirf ladko ko hi rights dene me confident hota hai qki vo sab jante hai ......women right se related itni movies bani hai koi unke baare me baat nhi krna qki vo movie reality nhi or jab kese biography ki baat Karo tho vo bigdi hui hai.... Ladko ko emotion express krne ki freedom nhi h or ladkiyon ko ladko ke bara bar khade hone ki freedom nhi hai

Guru Nank Ji bhi example hain
"I have no issues with equal rights to women. It should be given. But what about where discrimination with boy occur?
Eg:-1) if I passed 10th or 12th,Bsc exam in bihar as a boy I didn't get a single rupee but girls get upto ₹50,000.
2) In nursing job for girls 80% reserved. Isn't this discrimination?
3) Many places like Delhi travel for  girls free isn't this discrimination, is not possible to make free travel for boys also.
   Hope you explain about this issue also."

LGBT community is destroying India ..
"There are 100 reasons why women are superior in their own way and men are not capable of 1% of that superiority. Both are different and GOD has made them that way...
why are we trying hard to put them in a competition ????
there is no comparison....."
Very good video
"When you realize there weren't any matriarchal civilizations in history and the fact that men have built every civilization by their sweat and blood makes feminism and matriarchy irrelevant and ridiculous. Its just a way to promote misandry and gynocentrism which builds unfavourable environment for both the genders, making them loathe and fight each other while destroying families and ultimately leading to the downfall of society because women can now act according to their whims and desires. They don't have to obey any authority."
Kitne baar thumbnail badloge😂😂😂
I'm always excited for Dhruv's videos
"More power to all the women and men out there...

Thats super awesome
"Thank you so much for clarifying what Feminism is, But I request you to make a video, how fake feminist Male/Female taking advantage of a beautifully equality concept as their shield for doing nonsense thing like you did with Animal Cancer Video. It's not hate but I just want a video where you'll talk about how fake feminism reuining the meaning and creating a bad effect in some of good human life. I love your video and explanation and I'd love to see your explanation. 
Like fake rape case, Fake dowry case and etc. As a victim I'd love to see the video."
Lekin aajkal koi feminism ki real definition shayad hi follow karta hai zyadatar ladkiya jo khud ko feminist batati hai unka yahi matlab hota hai ki wo ladkiyon ke favour me ya 'team' me hai isiliye koi is ideology ko sach me follow karta bhi h to khud ko feminist kehne se bachta hai ke agar kal ko kisi ladke ke rights ke bare me bol diya to ye fake feminists sir pe aa khadi hongi

"Respected DR sir, OR Team DR,

I wanted to inform you that there is a huge mess up and mismanagement that took place this year in jee mains 2024. I request you to raise our voice by analysing the current scenario and information data available online. 

Trust me it is a serious matter.


Inshort there were 10 papers this year on dates 27,29,30,31Jan and 1 Feb (morning and evening). There are many data available and tutors who have raised there voices but these is only between those who gave jee. Other than those people are unaware about this thing.On 13 Feb the results were announced.


There were around 12.3 lakh candidates who gave their examination on jee 2024. 

Jee gives percentile to examine the competition of each session and then they make the result. What actually happened this year is as follow( I am not telling you to blindly trust this speech but please analyse the scene on internet you will got it)"

Pls Dhruv make video on porn industry😢
Dhruv you have a lot to live and understand. You'll soon get the taste of truth.
"Thanks for covering such a heavy yet important social topic! Hopefully, we have social reform where such topics are included in high school curriculums (others topics being financial management, emotional intelligence, etc). 
It’s interesting you included Neena Gupta’s clip in the beginning as that was my 1st thought when you mentioned females pushing the idea of patriarchy (even though I admire her for her openness)!
Social conditioning has been happening for years and not many can stand against it as they fear of being alone or outcasted. 
Society, cultural practices, education, religion, etc all influence how women and men are viewed and what “place” they hold in a household. Growing up in 80s I used to challenge these differences like my brother was allowed to stay out late even though younger but I had curfew of 7-8pm, he didn’t have to do house chores but I was forced to learn them, I had to learn to save money but he was allowed to spend on snacks with his friends, I wasn’t allowed to enter the mandir area or enter kitchen during menstrual cycle and so many other examples. And the funny part was- all of my girl friends were following or had to follow same rules. 
I would be punished for questioning the authority and humiliated for asking to be treated equally but I would be reminded all the time that if didn’t go with the flow then I would have hard time finding a boy for marriage (which I didn’t and in fact I met a lot of jerks in the process and choose to wait for the right person). 
The point is social reform doesn’t only need to happen at a constitutional level but also at a household level (this would be grassroots level) where feminism and patriarchy doesn’t need to called out but rather there’s equality, respect for each gender, acceptance and home free of biases!"
"Bruhh,you are illogical..."
This video is non-sense…. Druv Rathi doesn’t understand anything …big time idiot

"To promote Gender Equality the topic should not have been named as Feminism cos no one will dig in deep to understand it. Like most of them in world judge the book by its cover the same way they understand feminism by its title, hardly anyone knows it emphasizes on gender equality.

Because today in indian society both male and female reason are declining that raises to the discrimination for both side❤"
"“Only Women Children and Dogs are loved unconditionally. A man however is loved Under a Condition that he provides something”
This is reality and it gives answers to your questions about Patriarchy. Frankly speaking i love your videos and you are an intellectual fellow but in this topic i oppose your beliefs not the one that “Women shouldn’t have rights” but the one in which you talked about how Patriarchy is an issue. Well if it was an issue then our societies wouldn’t function for all these decades. We still got to the Moon, we still made Nukes, Wifi, AI , Transport all of this was made bcz men were incharged of construction and development and they did their jobs under the sewers under the tonnels medling with garbage. But now you are telling us that somehow we are wrong Patriarchy is an Issue. Then i think there is something wrong with your New Untested Method.
And to add a very important but Factual info
It was Men who allowed women to enter all these spaces and their rights but after that they started yapping about how being Gay is ok then “women dont need men” then Men are evil and after that they started talking about accepting Trans people instead of treating them Mentally. Just see where it has Got us bruh."

"I thought you would talk about toxic feminism(Which you did a little in the end.)(just like you talk about toxic masculinity). 
But you talked only about feminism.
Though i am with equal rights but nowadays I think most of the females use the word feminism to their benefit. They want to justify everything by toxic feminism.
Everyone should understand that fighting for Equal rights and doing whatever you want are not the same thing(applied for both genders)"

Bro agar equal rights ki baat aati hai then why  girls have reservations in every exams..!! Aren't they equal to men. They why there are specific reservation for women!! The only one who appears HYPOCRITICAL here!! is you sir!!
Dhruv bhai apne hamari bat smjhne me galti kardi syd.... Hum feminism khilaf nhi the lekin kya esi filmo se girls ke dimag me feminism ka kuch alag  concept banta jo completely wrong hai....  these types of films should be criticised too. Girls misuse their rights against men as a weapon. Iske khilaf hain hum .... Khud girls ko feminism ka mtlb nhi pata ....
Full support ❤
I do understand that this films do not justify the real feminism but they do portray the picture of what is feminism is to our youths who aren’t really educated on such topics and learn mostly on social media and by films. Such films are highly brain washing our youth to a great level making them think that this is the real feminism or how should a sigma male should behave. I think you should release a second part on such topic about how such films are brain washing our youth
Dhruv rathee bohot acha editing karta he is admi ko aur subscribers milna chahiye

I m really sorry for my thinking about Feminism. 😢 after this video i know lot of things to learn.
I wish boys of my age would see this video...they literally live in a life of memes ...always want to be cool and alpha male ....that's why I always stay away from them cause I don't want to be a topic for gossip to them  ...I'm really thankful to myself ❤

"Dhruv brother please one video on ""ELCETROL BOND""."
"Gender equality is a myth until people realise that patriarchy isn't the solution. Ek ghar ghar tab banta hai jab pati aur patni dono ek team banke kam kare. The problem with this modern world is that they get motivated by anything instantly without even realising. Everyone is busy watching memes, sigma videos and movies like Animal*. The society is a mess, full of idiots who just don't want gender equality. They're just making videos and manipulating teens. Realise first that we all are humans✅️"

"The problem is in the name itself . Make it equal rights instead of ""feminism"" .

 Feminism may have a particular defination but... No one is here to to explain feminism to some illetrate , uneducated , underdeveloped popular people present at top of the society ,media and cinema. A large population of females follow them and get a completely different idea about it.  And that is why we've got some movies, speeches and all which provokes both genders. 

There is no patriarchy today except in some very very rural areas . It is in the past now everyone gets to study and beacome something these days. Patriarchy ended and feminism still lives    and for what ?

Feminism today involves equal rights for everyone  except men. 

Females have far more legal rights than men , i think legally males are helpless."

"Men and women are not made to compete, women are for men . If a good woman is with a good man he can win the world ❤ . Stop comparing, man is incomplete without a good woman"
"This vdo is not only for boys or gurls.....every gender should watch this ❤
Yes,we cant be equal but we can be similar guys.....its not a point of getting chances its the point of thought :)"
Big Thanku Dhruv bhai before the video I knew feminists only talks about right of women thanku for change my mind I will try to spread this word!!
And this is how real feminism is misunderstood by the society... So disappointing 😔
👏👍
❤❤ most favourite 9:31
"Wah He just quoted Vhp  and garuda puran . Didn't even have guts to point out other religion where there there are no women rights at all. No equal right of property is even mentioned in their holy book. And people say you are unbiased  .Bhai propaganda ke chakkar pe itna bhi mat giro ki you just criticize just one religion. Fine BJP is not perfect even hinduism is not perfect, so you keep bashing one party and one religion. And No i am not a unemployed Andhabhakt, before you make this comment and move on. I am an Educated working professional always ready for a healthy discussion ."
"Fun fact : He changed this video thumbnail ""thrice""😂😂😂😂😂😂"
Beautifully explained 🎆🎉i like it ❤

Jitna bhi gali doo agor equality ke bare mein ladkiyon ko jada barhaba dogi toh hamara desh mein bhi  devorce jyada hogi
feminism is fraud ...
"In the name of feminisms many spreading toxic thoughts rather than equality... And dhruv mankinng videos  his one eye is open and another is closed..


In the name of feminism many peoples spreading such a toxic thoughts and his eyes and ears can't see of hear that.

Kind of selective amnesia..."
"Sorry to say, 3rd wave or modern day Feminism is not same as Feminism."
Lekin ajkal to aurat ko jyada rights bhaiya ji...
And what are your views on section 69?
Thook diya dhruv teri is video pe .....
Plz make a video on Pakistan elections 2024..
The Best & the  Most Nicely  Explained Video on FEMINISM so Far on Youtube!! Great Work Dhruv Sir...❤
"शुरुआत तो अच्छे से की थी लेकिन 13:00 से लेकर 15:00 बकलोली पेल दी, ये patriarcy नहीं बल्कि basic biology है! अब नर कुत्ते भी लड़ते झगड़ते है, क्या इसका मतलब है कि कुत्तों में भी patriarchy होती है???🤔"
Rajam Ram mohan roy sir🥹📈
Dhruv Rathee please kisaan andolan par bhi video banao.
"Dear dhruv, with all due respect, you are also a cancer to society"
"Great sir keep it up
Thank a lot ❤"
Dhruv bhai ek hi dil hai kitne baar jitoge 😢❤❤
I don't really care about the definition but the people who uses it to the extreme.
The fact that we're different doesn't mean one is superior to the other. Though I want women to have the same rights as men and get paid the same if they're giving the same contribution. I personally believe when a woman takes care of her House her children she's raising the future and the raising of the future is a very important task than any other
bahut achha video

"Animal mei joh female characters hai, unhone toh yeh script padh kar acting ki,  toh unhe koi kyun nahi bolta, no body forced her to do this role,
Why did they accept such roles in the first place"
"You are absolutely right. In this video you have touched every point. I remember when that case happened where that woman was slapping that Driver all these toxic men were so quick at posting how this is feminism this is because of empowerment as if women should not be empowered because of their empowerment they’re going to go around and slapping men, and there was so much misogyny and hatred towards women and I was so boggled Thinking that do these men not have mothers and sisters? Do they not have any empathy for them and what happens they see their mothers and sisters being suppressed at home and as a boy child they’re given special treatment when they go out they are nobodies and they see all these women progressing And they think women should be like their mother and their sister who are treated badly who go through everything that they do to them or their fathers. It’s the ingrained misogyny and I responded to one of those comments and I was bombarded with the toxic men, trying to justify how this is happening because women are being empowered. So the problem of modern India is that women are being empowered and they should not be that’s their issue. It was so ridiculous that you could see these people are talking with only two brain cells and there is just no point responding to them but it gives a good example of patriarchy at play, and then they make arguments like men are falsely accused , law is tilted towards women and what not and I have seen men guilty of things and then to save themselves from punishment They say they are innocent and they didn’t do anything and they’re being falsely accused a lot of guys do that. Fortunately I have had amazing examples of men in my life for most my father and I have immense empathy fir men in  General and anybody for that matter, their lives are difficult but there are toxic and psychotic men also out there who make everyone’s life difficult, and in today’s world, those men are having hard time getting Someone to marry them and now that is converting into incel community and they have even more rage against women because they’re not accepted as who they are by women which is aggressive, self-centred, selfish, narcissistic."
I believe every viewers of this video become a feminist. ✌️🤞

"Well, well now let's talk about the pressured lbgtq content in any literal series and movies. 🙁 Because of this I have to leave that film or series and everywhere I go  it same. It really feels like they are forcing it."

"मान गए भाई ध्रुव, मैं 22 साल का हूं आए दिन देखता रहता हूं कैसे समाज में लोग Petriarchy विचारधारा को बढ़ावा देते हैं | मैं जब कभी अपने दोस्तों से feminism या  feminist होने की बात करता हूं तो मेरा मजाक बनाया जाता है, मुझ पर मेरे ही दोस्त हस्ते है लेकिन मैं इस सोच के साथ खुदको बेहद पसंद करता हूं | आज की इस पीढ़ी को इस विचारधारा की आवश्यकता है, आज कल सोशल मीडिया पर बड़े सिगमा, अल्फा, विमेन ☕ करते फिरते है वो भी सिर्फ कुछ लाइक्स के लिए औरतों का मजाक बनाते हैं | बेहद शर्मनाक लगता है जब भारत जैसे विकासशील और धर्मनिरपेक्ष देश में ऐसी सोच को बढ़ावा मिलता है, लेकिन मुझे आपका विडियो देख कर बहुत अच्छा लगा आजके युग में इसी की बहुत आवश्यकता है | धन्यवाद ध्रुव ❤🇮🇳"
"I m not against women, ofcource without a woman ( mother ) no one can exist on this planet.

But I see many such examples, when a man earns and takes care of his family then it is a normal thing but if a woman earns then she leaves no stone unturned to show herself superior to the man. I know many such families where women misused their powers and destroyed a happy family. And what can we say about today's girls who play with the emotions of boys?? Be it love or responsibility, it is always the man who becomes crazy (Majnu), Laila often sees the opportunity and makes her way.

Sorry for this but it's my inner feelings who written into words 🙏"
Watch movies like a movie Broo don't make it a social issue to gain views... What's the purpose of all those studies if you will gonna criticize the movie after all those studies...???

One drunk man is more intelligent than three women with PhD degree
'Chhapri gang' 😅😂 simply great!

Im 16 and im also feminist
Nice and very clear research on feminism.💮💮
बहुत सारे बाबा भी हमारे देश में ऐसे हैं जो स्टेज पर बैठकर फेमिनिज्म के खिलाफ बोलते हैं?¿
We need feminism not pseudo feminism(Who says they can survive without men) there must be women empowerment but sometimes it often leads for them to take advantage and become pseudo feminist so both masculinity and pseudo feminist are equally threatening to our society we need feminism especially in India but must know how to differentiate this with pseudo feminist
Only support good human
"However, it is also a fact that feminism is often disparaged by many feminists themselves, like take an example of Neha Dhupia and the makers of Four more shots etc like filth. Feminists should fight the snakes present in them first then battle patriarchy and misogyny."
Now that's what I call Education. God knows what they are teaching us at schools and colleges.
Brillent mind man
"I am not agreeing with you on this one. I mean look at the western world, look at their divorce rate , look at their broken families whereas in India divorce rate is lowest as well as families live and love each other. Men are supposed to work harder and provide for family while women are  expected to take care of house and kids. This is the best way to bind the families together."
My respect for him📈📈
"When you said imagine an unemployment person.. I literally imagined myself😢

Btw video was awesome."
A man who actually told about reality

Thank you brother for your valuable information...🫂🫡🙏🏻
Meanwhile me watching this video as a Narcissist ☠️
i can debate with anyone that this video is soo wrong
I have a huge huge respect for this man.. he always make sure to educate people with right thoughts .. not so called influencers jo ajkl har glt chiz karke or usi glt ko influence krte hai logon ko
"Ok ..... sarkar kyo fir women right ko badhati ja rhi ??? Kanun mai ladki ko bechara kyo dikhaya jata ?? 
1. Ek ladka kase kudh ko nirdosh sabit kar sakta hai agar sex hua hai or ladki baad mai mna Kane lage ???
2. Ek ladki ladke pe shadi se pehle sex karne par jail kra sakti hai par ladka kyo nhi??
3. Society mai ladki ki baat tab tak sach hai jab tak baat galat prove Naa ho or ladke ki baat koi kyo nhi sunta ??
4. Ladki ka ladke ko maarna justify ho sakta hai tho ladko ka ladki ko maarna kyo nhi??
5.ladki jab ladke ko maarti hai tho ladke se ye umeed kyo ki vho respect women ki vajah se kuch Naa bole ??
6. Divorce ke time hafe property ka kya matlab pati ki mehnat ki property sirf iss liye kisi or ko dedo ki shadi kar li thi ??"
"Hamesha hindu society ko hi example ke roop me kyn dete ho

Sir apne btane ka way bht interesting bnata h video ko😂😂😂 funny example dete ho ap kafi 😂
"No one has a problem with Feminism. It is Pseudo Feminism that everyone has a problem with.

@Dhruv Rathee, Next topic for you: Why man should pay maintenance and alimony in a failed marriage. Talk about what you actually see in real life, not the exceptions."
"One of the major problems are those toxic “feminists”, who want more rights than men, considering themselves above men, wanting more pay without much work. This really spreads misinformation about what feminism actually means, thus most people think feminism is bad.
And about the alpha male stuff, they are just trying to catch up with the toxic “feminists”. It’s mostly about these insta and YouTube videos and reels, stupid edits, which started as a joke and now became a mentality. God help this world."
Third gender also has equal right
How many times will u change the thumbnail??
Dhruv bhai love you hogya😭🫡
Bro u changed the thumbnail. Before it was animal movie something I noticed @dhruvrathee😂
I'm a feminist after watching this video. Is anyone out here to join me?
Bhai apni garud Puran ke bare mein to bol diya thoda Kuran ke bare mein bol dete sari kamiya Hindu mein hoti hai
"Their is huge rise & Pride taken when Feminists say ""Women owned"",  ""Women Operated"" & ""All Women firm"". They simply don't care about employing Men. Is this not Discrimination?  Is this not reverse Racism?"
Dhruv rathee bhai kyu boor ker rahe ho desh me itni cezz chal rahi hai unper video banao 7 navy wale wapas aye farmer protests or bhi bohot kuch

This video has opened my mind.👍
"Dhruv apki sab vdos amazing hoti hain itni km age me itni samajh bht km logon me hoti h ,india me so called rashtrawadi log sab muslims ko atankwadi kehte hain inko samjhao kya kisi atankwadi hamle ka aam muslim ne kabhi support kiya jaise ye bajrang aur anya dalon ka kr rahe hain, i hope u can describe it very well, kya ek aam bharat ka muslim aurangzeb ko alkayda ko support karta h never"
Feminism Has Made Women Life Miserable
"17:15 , I was in doubt, but when he mentioned that she is a feminist, I became certain that the video is propaganda. Casey does not identify herself as a feminist."
You are very intelligent and so rational sir ❤
"Very informative and interesting video. Although women are getting equal rights but  at slow pace, although women prime ministers  in the world proved better in performance than their counterpart."
"Puri video dekhi par........
Samjhana jra👇🤔"
example of social conditioning or religious conditioning that women wear burqa in in 45 degree temperature
"To be honest i dont have any problem when feminism or women having equal right as men the problem i have is when womens say woman are greater than men , in the name of euqal rights they are selling their  n*udes on internet and filing fake r@pe cases on men Is this really what feniminsm is?"
Main ladkiyon ko equality dey toh deta magar ek reason hai
We need more men like him in society.
respect button ❤
From This video learning our society lot of things ❤love you sir❤❤❤❤
"the problem is, today mostly those who are so calledly and openly standing for Feminism are presenting Feminism as Matriarchy"
Superb
All india behind dhruv rathee atleast on this video.. 😅❤️
👌🏻👌🏻
❤❤❤❤
epic me kaha gaya hai  - Brahamdev ne tridev aur tridevio ko ek saman adhikaar diye the
pretty common behaviour that I have observed in social media is that people just comment on the situation  without even knowing the full story. I don't know how why these idiot just assume the situation and talk nonsense
You always inspire me with your research work and analysis ❤❤
Bhai naa mene animal movie dekha hu na feminist movies bhi nhi dekhta study per video banao yrr bahut din aapne banaya nhi study per video
Thanks!
I am glad i watched this
8:51 ye aurat ka khud ka bhi toh ek career hai. Kitni hypocritical baat hui ye
Thanks Bhai
Animal film to ldkiyo ne khub dekhi aur character ko bhi like kiya to kya boycott ni kr skti thi ya unko Krna hi ni tha jabki sbse phle to unhi ko bolna tha
Amezing example for chapri alpha 22:00
salman rashdi is not a legendary Author he is heretic he hurt the believes of many Muslims
Can you make video about pollution problems and remedy for India
Finally someone spoke about it❤
"Even though I've not been a great fan of Dhruv, this is one of the best, very practical and true to life video I've ever seen on this topic on men/ women equal rights...👍🏻"
In today's world even women do not like to call them feminists because its meaning is not taken literally. It's considered as opposite of patriarchy.
Baba saheb was also a great feminist
I believe in equal rights
feminism ❤❤❤every woman becomes mother ❤️❤️girls always respectfull
Mere chahne ya na chahne se kya fark padta hai phir bhi Main chahta hu ki Aap Genghis khan ki history par detailed video banayein Or is par ek rational person ki vichaar dein Thanks
"bhai aap kahan ki baat ko kahan lekar ja rhe ho  humare yahan gharelu aur sushil  larki ka matalab ye nhi hota ki wo  agar bahar jakar kuch karna chahti h to wo na kare 
aap kahin ki baat ko kahain jor rhe ho 
haa ye baat shi h ki bahut se jagah p women's ke rights violate hote haur ye galat bhi h 
par jo ek adarsh patni adarsh nari ki baate kahi jaati h wo bhi shi h kyuki aaj ke time p wo moral values khatam ho rhi jo larke karkiyo ko milte the aaj biagamy aur polygamy ek feminism ka hissa ho gya h aur pucho to kaha jata h ki my life my rule 
aap hi batao ye kahan se shi h"
Feminism - Randibazi karna
Make one video on fake feminism 🙌
Absolutely clear.
Every person should watch this and see importance of giving and be a good person and both men and women are equal and nobody should dominate give equal rights both should share work responsivity😍🤩❤💜
Who will explain toxic feminism who is mind washing young girls
"Bhai tum bhi discrimination hi kar rhe. 😂 
What do mean by chhapri boys? Yeh kaun si category hai?"
"This video is just a populist approach to the whole topic. Boys / Men, take a good care of yourself first, then think about feminism. Don't sacrifice your own happiness and wellbeing in an effort to follow an ""Ideology"" called feminism. Be nice, but be in touch with reality. The women/girl groomed by partriarchal generation will not be able to appreciate a feminist man over a well built, well groomed, money making ""not so feminist guy"""
"You are right, the movie is meaningless"
❤❤❤
"Everything’s right…..only the part where female friendships are better than male ones, I would like to object. Male friendships are way more understanding, uncompetitive and open in nature, very unlike the way you depicted here for the sake of content bias. And also not expressing emotions is kind of good for any person. Why bother anyone else with my issues. 
Again, in the Animal or the Kabir Singh movies, negative emotions were shown by the director, which you vehemently opposed. 
You have kinda objected your own statements for the sake of content I feel. Though equal rights are obviously should be mandated. Also, if you have connections with the corporates you would have known, currently hiring is more for the females over deserving males, for the sake of gender diversity. I am a student at an IIM, so am quite aware of this.
Please stop making content only for the sake of views, do some relevant in depth research first. We need talents anyhow, not some diversity quota or anything. This is 21st century, bro."
I think you should also make a video on Indian law against men
Why am I crying
"Well I am a feminist but I strongly advise to not to watch this video and try to understand what feminism is. This guy is using misdirection so strongly that is appalling. He is pushing his way of thinking and his own experience to dictate what something really means, however it’s just completely a bias and illogical opinion. Rest if up to you how you want to interpret."
"Wow,you call them illogical and still argue that men and women who are doing equal jobs should get equal pay. Are you aware of the fact that women get mood swings during periods.and this was admitted by a feminist to me by mistake while she was trying to justify the menstrual leave.if she is getting mood swings and become unproductive for 4 to 5 days in a month,how can she expect payment equal to a man doing same job with full productivity for full month?"
Sir ek video banaye jisme bataya jaaye india me kaisi english boli jaati h aur real english jo europe me boli jaati h like wo idioms and phrases me baat krte h
Such a amazing informative video Dhruv bhaiya ❤

Mere kuch arguments hai Jo tumse nehi milenge dhruv
Thank you very much ❤😊
Boys don't cry😢😢
"Kabhi dhruv ne baki animals ko dekha especially mammals ,its pointless to explain.rathee wont understand if women go and do job the younger generation get spoiled very badly unwatched and no connection at all well no point in telling low iq fools"
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 good work dhruv
Very good topic
He bhai! Yha ap jitna smjha le ye log n sudharne vale😢😔
Hats Off! Hadn't heard true feminism described so truly yet !
Thnx dhruv ❤ for providing amazing videos 😊
m kaafi purana fan hu apka .. per aaj kl ki video m thoda jhol hone lg rh h for example ranveer wali clip m unke bolne ka mtlb kuch aur tha and rhi baat animal ki to aap ek bar dekho vo wha mujhe ase nhi lga ki women ko defame vgra kuch kia h
Animal movie is worst than actual animal itself. Degrading humanity to the core.
US gave political right to women in 1972 while women already had political rights since back then in islam
I am also feminist
"I don't care about patriarchal and feminsim, all i care about my family that's all, In my opinion male and female are the same so of course females have same right as males but i am against to LBGTQ 🏳‍🌈 they are just you know!"
BRO MAKE ONE VIDEO ON NEET AND JEE HOW STUDENTS WERE FRUSTRATED LIKE KOTA SUCIDE CASES
"should have mentioned 
Andrew Tate & Jordan Peterson"
totally stupid video.If Man and women is equal. Become Pageant Mr dhruv Rathee
Nice content👏
Feminist hona glt nahi hai uska upyog glt krna glt hai
Great 👍
"hey dhruv rathee i want to know your opinion on some questions .. if you think mens and womens are equal 
 then do you think the decision to save womens and childrens on titanic was wrong and womens to let flee from ukraine war was also wrong .. should womens also be forced to fight war alongside mens like it happened centuries ago .. whats your take on this ?"
I think mushlim ko samjh aa gya hoga
"i did not want to have intimation without my wife's consent but her family wanted me to force her, so we didn't connect. This is patriarchy, I guess. And now we got seperated."
15:36 I don't agree with your point fully
❤
7:48 hence proved : biggest enemy of women is women as always
Best 🎉
Dil ko sookun milta he ye jaanke ki aap jese log duniya me he . love you druve rathee sir ❤
Why you changed thumbnail
13:05 Arpit Bala also once said Same Line par Uss Time maine uss baat ko Majak me liya thaa 😮
huge respect for dhruv
Mai manta hun ladkiyan kamzoor hoti isiliye unko na shirf equal rights mile balki unke liye kuch unke favour me rights mile tho mai kya hua? 🤔
"""You have gone mad. You are just trying to manipulate the common people. Nature has some laws, and we can't break them. People with no jobs, with no work, think about these things. A man and a woman can never be equal. But we have to give them great respect. Rather, I would say we all human beings should give respect to each other, whether it's male, female, or any sect from LGBTQ. Everyone cannot be equal, but should be given equal respect. You mentioned when a man cries, we say it doesn't suit you. Yes, that is very true. See, when a father is supposed to cry in front of his daughter, then how it looks and how society can accept that. As much as we try to break the laws of nature, it is simply inversely proportional to our peace. That is it!!"""
Mad like dhruv rathi will not realise pain of MEN who was trapped in false case by woman in india
11:13 I imagined my self🗿
😂tbh most indians ...well actually most people around the world dont even get the concept of feminism. It is for equal opportunities. It has nothing to do with females alone as it is misconstrued today. Feminism as a concept is beautiful and very empowering but it has been morphed to mean misandry. PEOPLE! MISANDRY IS NOT FEMINISM. yeh toh wahi baat hogayi ki hamare bhagwan aur guruo ne hame sikhaya kuch aur humne uska matlab nikala kuch aur to serve our purpose😂.
Dhruv ye sb pta h hme....tumhe asa to ni lgta k me batunga inkoo....kuki tumhari body language se to asa he lgta haiii....kash sbi 1 sal upsc pd le inki dukaan bnd ho jani
Also about neha dhupia in a previous season of roadies where iram slapped kashish neha supported kashish not iram😊
Nice knowledge
your whole explaination had been show in the sony sab show Wagle ki Duniya
Such a knowledgeable video that I  was needed.
Every time i watch your video my respect for u increases
People qsked video on feminism ❌ on psudofeminism✅
"Aadarsh mahila me bhi isne religion ghusad diya😂 
Burkhe me bhi dikha deta."
How can u say that black man is different from white man at 10:04 ? That's just unacceptable
Dumb feminist like dhruv will not give attention to 1.5 lacs men suicides yearly due to fake cases by woman on men..
I'm a big big fan of your way of thinking. Thank you stand liya apne
"This changed my mindset and views about feminism 
Thank you Dhruv Rathee"
Giving equal rights still never gonna make women equal to men… both are dependant and have their own strengths and weaknesses… best is to understand each other individually and do things which are right logically.
❤❤❤
Instead of this caption -Is Feminism Destroying Indian Society? shouldn't it be Is Patriarchy Destroying Indian Society?  A negative word with Feminism is not complimenting each other... Otherwise an amazing informative video☺!!

If there would be a boy in place of girl then whole feminist would have oppose it but because a boy was beaten up so no feminist oppose it.Why?
Is it equality(feminism)?"
Kisaan andolan 2.0 ko lekar kya vichaar hai apke ??? Ya koi Dabav hai aap par ?
But i heard feminist says that man should pay for having sex with their wives. What about this?
"Great video 
."
@dhruvrathee what if someone sexually harass your wife would you think like Budhha
"Next make a video about false allegations, paternity fraud or 498A misuse. If you have a spine..."
"He talks about Garud puran
But he can't even think about hijab, isn't this is backward thinking Mr.(Rashid)Rathee"
Weak men speaks like this.💀
Nowadays the Actual meaning of Feminism is continuously  misusing by many female Influencers!!😑 I also want an  Equal Society but this toxicity and hypocrisy is literally a jerk🤦🏻‍♂️

"Hi sir, good evening, can you please make video regarding conflict between fund transfer from Central govt and State govt, both are throwing stones at each other, and this has become big news,as a public I would like to know, who is correct"
My opinion on  this video is don't hear the idel words. People are crab mindset so they always bring a new bad words.
Well Researched. Very Few People Can Make This Type of Content .
Isase yah pata chalta Hai ki ladkiyan bhi Sahi Nahin Hoti to aadami bhi Sahi nhi hote ladkiyan bhi galat Nahin Hoti aur ladke bhi galat Nahin
Who was there yesterday who have realised that thumbnail is changed ! 😂
21:40 and the dialogue of the movie no means no was on point
Bhai itni jaldi thumbnail Kyon change kar diya?😅
"Finally someone said it!! It is really sad to see feminism get degraded by toxic events , hoping that this video will reach the right audience 😊"
"One question, who will give the rights to women? And who will give the rights to men to downgrade women??"
"Really glad to see Dhruv has got the confidence to say these bold things freely. People like Andrew tate are polluting internet while on the other part onlyfans celebrities are spreading limitless garbage.

Feminism can and should always be about treating females with pride and equal opportunity to grow while “that’s her choice” needs to be denied too. Being a cheater cannot be her choice. 

Well made video Dhruv. Young Indians will learn a lot from u, already have i guess."
21:40 this movie is one of the most underrated movie in Bollywood the movie portrays with the amazing example that how people have made their mindset and rules for women which are not even in written in our constitution and  If am talking about four more shots and thank you for coming these movies are very poorly written and these movies are just like imaginary patriarchy and imaginary feminism without knowing the real meaning of these words they are just doing this for attention that's it
"Feminism is a thing jiske against saare hindu, muslim,sikh chhapri ladke ek ho jaate hain."
Nice dhruv
"Yeah on social media especially instagram contains these type of reels about women and relating with feminism , which manipulate these insta users."

"Feminists are not saying any words against the wrong move done by the female...that is also not good .  In real life, women are getting more benefits than men, there is no men help line number,  men help support in India, even in human rights office also if any man asks for his rights , one can hardly get the help. So please make some videos on men help support. so that the real male victim can fight against the fraud case  done by the female in this society. Is ke liye Dhruv Rathee, aap ko court se kafi reference milega."

I am so happy that he made this video and clearly explained the real issues about feminism and also indirectly gave a befitting reply to a youtuber who criticized him for making a video about Animal.
He talks on vishwa hindu parishad but not on muslim countries who opposes womens  in everything they do!!
"ab real masculinity pr bhi video banaiye,agar kuch pata hai to"

It’s not about masculinity and feminism. It’s about targeting right wing.

"bro feminism has some negative point which is against nature, jiska answer kisi ke pass nahi he. but anyway feminism not only affecting society and family structure but affecting womens health just only because feminism sikhata he MERA JISM MERI MERZI jab, affecting childrens life by not giving proper time because wo to JOB kar rahi he. career bana rahi he. 
your only telling oneside truth isse divorced ratio bhi badhey he, i don’t have numbers but this is not illogical in society everyone has different ROLE. if you mix them
system is going to fall down. 
by the way im not against women empowerment, empower them with education empower them with business empower them with evrry aspect in life bus they have ROLE IN SOCIETY which can not be denied.
your explanation is a bit against nature. thats all i have to say!!"
"No matter what’s topic, suddenly you see him targeting right winger organisation."

I thought a lot different for what feminism means but u cleared all my doubts. Iam so grateful to see this video I hope fool people of my class watch this
Thankyou Dhruv Sir for making this video ❤❤❤
"feminism is a biggest joke, if men collectively take away woman rights, women can not unite and fight back the men of that country. woman rights are actually given by men which itself state that men and women are not equal. have you ever heard that women granted rights to men throughout the history? and if men and women are equal then why women in Saudi Arabia or other middle east countries are uniting and fighting men to get equal rights ? its because they cant, because men and women are not equal"
Osho ko suno sab saval ke jawab h❤
Please spread this video!! Share it with family and friends!! Even today the fight for equality for women is far from over.
Kya aap bhi meri tarah 2x per video chalate ho
Thank you so much sir❤❤
क्या बे कांग्रेस के दलाल संदीप वांगा का बहुत पसंद है क्या  तुझे  बार बार उसका नाम लेता है जैसा तेरा बाप हो 😂
Jab tak Gender neutral laws nahi banaye jate India me tab tak ladke suffer karte rahenge aur feminism ka bhi koi Matlab nahi banega. Talking about equality while suppressing other make no sense.
"Agreed but kindly also explain that why few women think that they can slap a boy but i boy can not slap back.
Sab ke rights barabar hone chahiye. Politically, economically

What about girl expressing love or the better word is peeche padna is okay and if a boy does the same is crime. A girl kissing against boys will is just irritating and boy doing the same is crime.
I had a girlfriend and i know i chose a wrong girlfriend.
Where i had to take care of her or her feelings but she does not need to do the same. All above on the name of feminism. Bro if you get a girl like that. Ur life is finish."
I didn't know the meaning of actual feminism before....but now I'm proud to be a feminist and i love to promote gender equality without any hesistation....
If Dhruv Rathee become a ruler of India then I think whole India changed.
"औरत को न देवी मानूंगा न नौकरानी मानूंगा

Men cannot respect men. Why so much hatred there could be better way. Why this language chapri etc No one jsut have a thought they do respect their moters. Maybe some incidents have changed their minds.girls have a wierd way to of being feminist nothing was told in that case. Why only against men. I am a feminist myself that does give me the right to criticize all males. This was just because of the language you used for the males.
Thumbnail changed??
"But , men can’t be treated as women in society.😢😢"
I am impress with your ideas.    I heard that boys are like stones ; and girls are like diamonds.  But the idea I got from you today of Justice    Dhruv rathe ; your explanation is to the point and easy to understand.    Salute
😎😎😎😎
The fact that I already knew he would support all left ideas about feminism 😂
"You are much away from society otherwise you would know how much is the difference in biology.they should have there rights but encouraging women to be disrespectful to parents, husband, society.and see what feminism to the West."
"Meanwhile Feminists not visible in Ukraine war.
In West, there is a trend called MGTOW - Men go on their own way due to extreme Woke culture."
Boycott Dhruv rather for being a supporter of terriorism pseudo feminism
Nmeste Bhai
"Actually femenism used to be giving same opportunity for girls but now if u look at Europe, USA, femenism is about getting more privalleges and being loud mouthed. We should never allow this sort of ideology to spread in our cultures"
What about womens getting more right..what about that females blaming males for false rape case...there are many issues that you're not mentioning
"As usual, great work ✌🏻"
Chapri gang was epic😂

This is indian society bro we will have to accept it no choice left
Video on farmer protest needed
"I also support your opinion but 
Nature has made some differences between men and women
These are not only physical but also mental. There is a slight difference between men and women. The brains of men is 11percent bigger than women it is not only size matters but some parts of brain also work differently in men.
The hormones in women and men are also different the main male hormone testosterone is responsible for muscle mass and fat distribution while the amount of testosterone is less in women.
Researchers have shown that male are more aggressive than women and by these hormonal differences they have more tolerance.
At the end I would like to tell that nature made us differently but not in the sense of discrimination. Female should also be treated equally, they should be paid equally.
The real man always respects women and need of women😊"
please make video on farmer protest 2.0
Men's Problem which means Women's Problem all Same Good or Bad
"Very clear verdict about double standards and real feminism. But sorry to say Dhruv, you got Nina Gupta wrong She meant that women need men for giving them physical safety, which is true. Please go through her interview again. Other than this the video as always is Par excellence"

"Amazing video, thanks for bringing the real definition of feminism to the world. However, I have lot of concerns where females are not aware of actual feminism, where they take the feminism and women empowerment to a whole different level, specially working wives. First of all, I understand where did this all come from, and the whole blame goes to dominating males or males patriarchy. After that the right women started raising their voice in favor of Feminism, however most of the women misunderstood it. One of those examples can be the laws where more power is given to Women, what an irony it is with regards to Feminism/Equality, and where 70-80% cases women take wrong advantage, and the other party which are men always become Victim. Does anyone talk about those Victims?"

I’m actually 100% agree with you but yo do the same  in this video. you mentioned  Savitribai phale after Ishwar Chandra vidysa and raja ram mohan Roy. This is just for correction because I know you are pure soul
Great video ❤
"this video was on point, thanks for making this. I'm so tired of hearing people misunderstand feminism as hating on men. As if its not also about standing up for men's issues. Patriarchy negatively affects us all, some more than others, but everyone suffers."
Dhruv sir you are killing it!!! ❤ You have been giving excellent knowledge!😊

I love Dhruv Rathee for a reason ❤
Dhruv calling those people Chapri is next level 😂...much love to him❤❤❤❤❤
"Actually.. use of word (feminism)is going wrong , Now the society is moving towards Matriarchy.."
"The video discusses the concept of feminism and patriarchy, aiming to dispel misconceptions and provide clarity on their definitions and implications in society.
Feminism is defined as advocating for political, economic, and social equality between men and women, not seeking superiority for either gender.
Patriarchy, on the other hand, refers to a social system where men hold control and power over women.
Examples are provided to illustrate how patriarchal ideologies impact both men and women negatively, perpetuating harmful norms and expectations.
The video highlights that feminism does not seek to pit men against women but challenges patriarchal structures that harm both genders.
It addresses the issue of toxic masculinity, which pressures men to conform to rigid gender roles and suppress emotions.
The video criticizes the portrayal of superficial feminism in media and calls attention to genuine feminist films and movements that advocate for equality and challenge patriarchal norms.
Instances of hypocrisy in society's treatment of gender issues are highlighted, including double standards in relationships and societal expectations.
The video emphasizes the importance of understanding and supporting genuine feminist movements that strive for equality and freedom for all genders.
Ultimately, it calls for the dismantling of patriarchal structures and the promotion of genuine equality and opportunities for all individuals, irrespective of gender."
"Its just like..chapri wale...Ramji ka nam jor sor se lenge....
Lekin..Yahi chapri log me..Ramji Jaisa koi values nahi he

..sab ke sab chapri he sale..."
"But one cannot deny the fact that in promoting one gender we have endangered males as a gender in the last few decades. No doubt an adult woman has equal cranial capacity. But, where were women during women wrestlers' protest? Sorry to say but an educated Indian woman is loyal to her family, kids but she is not loyal to women as class . And when I say this please don't tell me I am against women education. Women as a section  is losing class consciousness. Hardly anyone is talking about men issues under the head of feminism. It's very easy to blame patriarchal mindset  for every single problem. Yes, it is a problem but adult women and men have understanding to judge what is right and wrong. But we fail in realizing ground realities. It is very easy to blame patriarchy for everything despite seeing the social reality women themselves are the biggest promoters of it. There was a time when there were people like Shulasmith Firestone and Iravati Karve"
Dhruv >>>>>>>>👔🙌
Kyu nhi ho rhi criticize
What about the men's suicides rate in Western countries which is highly feminists
I am sorry dhruv rathee but I respectfully disagree at Certain points

Why Sympathize with women
Bro makes the video on our thoughts 👍👍
"we know what the meaning of Feminism in this era. they are making fight each other man and women in our society.they are making fool our woman..... i aggre with you Rathe Ji. but,in this era the feminist are talking about ""WOMAN RIGHTS"" ,not about MAN RIGHTS. they alaways fight with boys about WOMAN RIGHTS. some days before a woman said this proudly that '' she don't need a man in her life,,she can survive alone. also she don't need a men for birth a child,she can do this with dog spa*m.'' what the nonsence. this tocix feminist are washed the brain of our woman.. i was always  respect woman,,but not the feminist, who maked a bad impact to our society. i hate them alawys......Men and women complement each other, they are not rivals"
Your videos make my days bhaiya...i feel i learn something new and beyond the school academics...Thank u 😊
"Sir main shirf ek baat  bolungi bs Jo ki mera sochna hai which means we don't need 
EQUALITY in our society we just want NEUTRALITY in our society in terms of human beings"
Women who follow religion are in favour of patriarchal society.
"Equal right and justice.. What a joke... Bro.... Go and see the no. of false matrimonial cases and no. of male suffering even being innocent.. Is it equal right? Whoever is done wrong should be punished irrespective of gender, but never happens in reality...What you gonna say about it.?
I address it to you before too but you never dare to say anything about it..."
Love you bro
Pahle ke video mein aur aapke video mein language ka bahut fark a gaya
"Feminism isnot a concept that is now being portrayed in the society presently. True feminism should work towards giving an equal life especially to marginalized women and women in general interms of their capacity development, decision making power and participation in economic and overall development. The buzz that's created now is taking the society to completely opposite direction our ancestor women fought for."
Who else seen that thumbnail changed?
Very poor
Bhai movie Ko itna seriously kyon le rahe ho
"In villages women are not allowed to laugh, they can't go anywhere without taking permission, they are treated like slaves. And iron is a lot of women have accepted this."
Weldon Dhru Rathi
"Women already have equal rights. Equal rights are not a problem anymore in most of the countries with democracy. In many countries like india , Women are given more rights and they are abusing that. Feminism makes no sense in 2024. Women talk about being independent and equality but still want alimony form husband because they want to live as a freeloader without working. In india Women get free public transport on many cities but men don't. Women think it's OK for them to have standards and choose a husband who is rich but if men want a beautiful girl as their wife and not an unattractive one then Women have a problem with that. It's ridiculous and it's definitely not about equal rights anymore and Women have more than enough rights."
"you are my only hope 
respect you bro for sharing your cool opinions"
I agree on most of the things you said in the video. But I think the current wave of feminism (or pseudo-feminism) is somewhat moving towards questionable directions.
Gender sanahi insan sa judge karo

Dhruv Rathee gay detected  feminism word itself comes from the feminine gender and u think u can change my mind by trying to add it with males the reason of man getting less musculine day by day is feminism and if its about equal rights women have too many rights then men have if they are not happy with this lets exchange the rights

Well the definition or the theory of feminism is admirable because of its utopian spirit while when it comes to practice there are massive differences at least what I've seen and experienced. Though I'm a English litrature student and i had a particular paper on feminism I can say The more one will delve into this rationally and most importantly without a bias and then coming out of it and looking into the society you won't find it's definition working in modern day world for both genders.

Men are not payed for glamour but women are , so does it mean now ad makers should forcibly hire men for ads.
There is a fine line between equality and over expectation that shouldn't be crossed.
Women on work in mechanical, chemical engineering field get benefits of  working in first or general shifts and not at night so now should men protest on such facts.
Equality can be demanded but not favorism.
In karnataka women get 2000rs without working , free bus ticket now what will the feminists say on such inequality and will they fight for removal of some laws which favor females over males."
"Good video.... I agree and believe in equality of opportunity for everyone, but not equality of outcome. Equality of opportunity is something that anyone with any sense would support, but for equality of outcome, you have to confuse beyond belief to support equality of outcome. 
There are multiple reasons for pay gap, and one of them is gender but it's not the only reason. You say women in aggregate are paid less than men, well then we break down by age, we break it down by occupation, we break it down by interest, we break it down by personality. It's a multivariate analysis."

"If we dive deeper patriarchy as an ideology has evolved from thousands of societal needs it may seem as toxic but probably isn’t. It’s easier to criticise the established norms than to create ideal societal architecture. Currently our society going through unprecedented paradigm shift with advent of social media over virtual outlets. It’s conflicting to support either. I feel we need to ditch these terms and for gender equality. USA is an obvious example where these ultra left liberal ideologies have wrecked the society blurring the lines of societal norms. I believe in gender equality in politics and work environment needed. Also needed is the respect for people on basis of merit, irrespective of their gender/religion/caste/tribe which is missing in our society."

"My opinion is that, nowadays men is not against feminism ( i.e. helping women getting equal rights) but we are against the rules and policies made by government that supports women but easily used by some women against men to satisfy their ego. In which men suffers a lot but even after false accuses no action is taken against that women. 
Equality should be for both genders.

And not women men's will be living happily and peacefully we can't deny this fact because of still patericial exists men's also carry so many responsibilities but this should be carry both male and female because of this happened women's faces discrimination, inequality and men faces responsibilities, unhappiness of hide their emotions etc etc .....

"I do not agree with Dhruv this time. The distribution of responsibility among men and women is continuously changing as per the  change in life style. The democracy is a devloped version of Governance of last two hundred years,  many isms like feminism have been developed on the base of neo politics....same is the word patriarchy.....but society taking women as weak is false......yes there is competition among men.....but that is with men to men to attract women.....

Dhruv dear view this from a different angle."

But it is true that a women can never be equal to a men 🙂

"Summarizing what you said 

Def of patriarchy, feminism, matriarchy 
Normative conformity 
Are men and women different 
Structurally and functionally 
Men's issue
  Unemployment
  Money earning
  Height 
  Violence 
  Man lonely ness 
     Crying 
     Emotional
Education of woman 
Right to vote



Feminism 
First talk about the things I agree with you that are wrong 
1) Normative conformity
2)Height 
3) Violence 
4) Man lonely ness 
   I) Crying 
  Il) Emotional
5) education of woman 
6) right to vote 
7) Feminism roasting

Now talk about the things about which I don't agree with you 
1)Functional equality between man and woman 
Do you think in every sector man and woman (numbers)equality is necessary 
Ans-- in different sectors different ratio of man and woman is ideal lets  understand it with examples 

1) let's consider the gynacology department in this sector you have two option 
   a) equal man and woman 
   b) more woman and less man 
       Now which will be a better no doubt option    
       'a'  is possible but do you think the option 'b' will be better  than option 'a'


Now answer some of my questions 

Who will be better to take care of a child a father or a mother both giving the same effort?     
Obviously both are important but the ratio of mother /father should be more than one or less think about it 

2) let's now consider the defence sector what should be the ratio here
a) only man should be present 
b) some women should also present 
c) the ratio man and woman should be 1
d) woman should only present 

What do you think here 

My preference is in normal conditions option A in special conditions it may go to B, C and between C and D. D is practically almost impossible 

In the above I am saying about the battle field fighting 

For different sectors the ratio and preferrance should vary 

You may have question why I am saying that woman's preferance for job should be secondary 

My Ans--- think about the long term 
Let's consider 

1)both the father and mother of a child doing jobs and they came tired after office and cannot take proper care of their children 

Most probably the child will not become a good person, a good citizen of a country and a good human being 


2) Mother is the housewife and the father does a job and comes late at night/not taking care of the child 

In this situation the child has more possibility of being a good human if her mother takes care of it with much effort though there is a possibility that the child will be inhuman (but it is majorly controlled by the mother's guidance) 
  In this situation if both will contribute to the family it will be good but their first priority is to make their children a good human 

3) you know this situation


Now answering the question why care of a child is so important 

I) in most of the cases parents guidance decide the feature of a child (human/devil) 

The one for whom you are earning actually unknowingly you are destroying their feature are you actually doing right 
Here earning for them doesn't mean 100% for them but at least some % for them 

I am saying doing a job for a woman /over working of man is bad but consequences from this if ignored is very bad in long term so I  want we should avoid it 

I should also remind you about a very innovative, futuristic and developed idea of developed countries and educated people about child birth control 
what consequences happened  you and I we all know population crisis population collpse 

From no child and child adoption to at least 2 (2.1) child per woman 

These are  human findings I don't want to regret feature or let my generation regret for it in feature 

Now I am finishing it  
Insallaha I will talk about other partially or fully not agreed statements later 

Thanks for reading till now /mere scroller"
I agreed with you...  I will chang my mind * mental block *
"2:40  Feminism Definition - 
Feminism is the movement to fight for equal rights & opportunities that men have. 
It neglects rights of men totally.
Feminists do not raise their voice against lack of rights for men, unequal laws that favor women.

Who are Feminists i reality today?
In reality, Feminists are bunch of losers who want to blame men for their failures."

"The biggest mistake our ancestors did was to underestimate a woman. Her softness and motherhood were not respected enough, she was not given all the rights because of her feminine energy. So she had to prove it to the world and fight for her rights. And today we all can see the importance of feminine energy which wasn't appreciated enough back then. A great video ❤"

"*What is Islam?* 
Islam is the name of the religion, or more properly the ‘way of life’, which God (Allah) has revealed and which was practiced by all of the Prophets and Messengers of God that He sent to mankind.  Islam specifically means being in the state of submission to God, worshipping Him Alone, and reverently accepting and obeying His Law. 

*Who are Muslims?*
The Arabic word “Muslim” literally means “someone who is in a state of Islam (submission to the will and law of God)”.  The message of Islam is meant for the entire world, and anyone who accepts this message becomes a Muslim.

*Who is Allah?*
Often one hears the Arabic word “Allah” being used in discussions regarding Islam.  The word “Allah” is simply the Arabic word for Almighty God, and is the same word used by Arabic speaking Christians and Jews.  As a matter of fact, the word Allah was in use far before the word God ever came into existence, since English is a relatively new language.  If one were to pick up an Arabic translation of the Bible, one would see the word “Allah” being use where the word “God” is used in English.  For instance, Arabic speaking Christians say that Jesus is, according to their canon belief, the Son of Allah.  In addition, the Arabic word for Almighty God, “Allah”, is quite similar to the word for God in other Semitic languages. 

*Who is Muhammad?*
The last and final prophet whom God sent to humanity was the Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him.

*What are the Teachings of Islam?*
The foundation of the Islamic faith is belief in absolute Monotheism (the Oneness of God).  This means to believe that there is only one Creator and Sustainer of everything in the Universe, and that nothing is divine or worthy of being worshipped except for Him.

*What is the Quran?*
The Quran is the final revelation of Allah to all of mankind, which was spoken by Allah the Exalted Himself and conveyed through the Arch-Angel Gabriel in Arabic to the Prophet Muhammad, in sound, word and meaning.

*What does Islam say about Jesus?*

The Islamic belief about Jesus demystifies for us who the real Jesus was. Jesus in Islam was an extraordinary individual, chosen by God as a Prophet and sent to the Jewish people. He never preached that he himself was God or the actual son of God. He was miraculously born without a father, and he performed many amazing miracles such as healing the blind and the lepers and raising the dead – all by God’s permission. Muslims believe that Jesus will return before the day of Judgement to bring justice and peace to the world. This Islamic belief about Jesus is similar to the belief of some of the early Christians."

then what is the meaning of equality? And if feminism and equality are same then why do we have two concepts(from two concepts I mean Equality and feminism)
"I would call myself a feminist if it means equal rights for both men and women, and while watching the video i was like ""yes his points make sense"" and then he start quoting hindu sculptures and books and vishwa hindu parishad and all..... and then i waited for him to say something about islam, the religion where females have lil to no freedom whatsoever, but no. Homie didn't said anything.  I do sometimes think are you a part of some sort of propaganda against hindus? to show the religion bad or something? coz like let's be real we know more qnd more freedom is given to hindu females nowadays, atleast in cities and all but why is it that you always have to criticize us on something and will never mention the good thinks, and how I've said all this, ppl might come and call me hindu nationalist or andhbhakt or bla bla bla whatever, but if a muslim person raises voice against ur videos ppl will just understand them without saying anything. It's just.... unfair man"

I have suffered from long depression for 7 years, due to PATRIARCHY, bullies, and the school and college system. I have lost precious moments of my life due to all this dirt. If I had answered them, I would have had to leave my career. But if I had the ability, I would have taught them all a lesson and it would have been absolutely fair. Surely the sitting God, who sits like a rich selfish rich merchant having all power, did not come to my aid even after a lifetime of devotion. and goodness and kindness."
What a well-made video! Loved how you covered so precisely!

"No doubt you have given clarity about what is feminism.
At the same time when a feminist let it be a male or female raise his/her  voice against inappropriate activity showing masculanity by  men should also raise voice against when it is done by women.( just the last example of a rich girl beating poor boy in public )
Just a mere silence of not supporting the act is an indirect way of supporting it."

While we acknowledge the validity of discussing the dynamics between feminism and patriarchy, we propose reframing the discourse. Instead of pitting these concepts against each other, let's shift our focus towards promoting equitable distribution of opportunities and recognition where they are genuinely warranted. I would also love to hear POV from you in this regard."

Being adarsh bahu there is no 'regressive character' it's the dignity of women we have in our culture the reason why WE RESPECT WOMEN and you're simply denying them of their basic principle? Like if a woman has a man who respects her loves her isn't it natural for her to do everything according to his man? We have all been raised in a home where we have this basic principle of 'FAMILY'. A person who has studied from abroad lives outside India has no audacity to reflect us our very own culture please shut up
But now all women were have equal rights
"""I am a scientist, business owner, writer, teacher, PhD holder. I am a lot of things. But I am not a feminist. You don't have to be a feminist or use the word 'feminism' to want equality.

Feminism leads to sub standard, compromising and low quality relationship dynamics for men.

Why not atleast talk about men's problems in this regard if not solving them.

Men talking abt such problems are tagged as desperate, creepy, looser.

Where is equality in this?"
Legends know that thumbnail was changed😂
"please cover Sandeshkhali incident from West Bengal, people need justice there"
Superb
"Neha dhopia se bada hypocrite person dhruv rathee, shame on you 👎"
He changed the thumbnail 3 times in 17hours
I totally 100% agree with what Nepolian said
women and men are equal in rights but their roles are very different in a society. in my point of view feminism means women should be given equal opportunities to flourish and do whatever they want to do in their lives and have their own opinions.
Hey please you promote Prashant sir. He really deserve
"Can you also discuss about Section 69 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Samhita the new penal code , which is clearly against men  but no one is speaking up about it DHRUV RATHEE"
Shame on you dhruv rathee
another reason to appreciate and respect Dhruv's team❤👏👏
Dhruv rathee dogla 👎👎
"Jb ladka Paisa kmata h to usko apni family ko upr uthana  uska kartvya hota h.
Wahi jb ek ldki paisa kmati h, to usko koi nhi chiye hota."
Dhruv rathee your youtube channel is my comfort place ! Keep making more videos
18:00 सावित्रीबाई फुले यांना महात्मा ज्योतिबा फुले यांनी शिक्षण दिले आणि त्यांनी मिळून मुलींसाठी महाराष्ट्रातील पुणे या शहरात तात्याराव भिडे यांच्या वाड्यात मुलींची पहिली शाळा सुरू केली. महात्मा ज्योतिबा फुले यांच्या निधनानंतर सावित्रीबाई फुले यांनी मुलींच्या शिक्षणाची मोहीम हाती घेतली
Thank you for the information.
Brother please make video on Punjab farmers protest and tell people the reality of modi 🙏
Maturity is when you realise dhruv rathee said right
Amazing 👏🏻👏🏻
"Dhruv rathee never talk about Islam, Islamic females shame on you 👎"
All these finer points are usually ignored in the pop culture and media. That's why the Andrew Tates of the world are so popular.
Men's are brave 😎
❤
Thanks❤
"The way we have been blinded by this world is so iconic at every level but thanks to you, I understand yet another concept which I misunderstood earlier. For haters who say you are manipulating them, are not to be blamed at all since they want to be blinded at all times for they are pleased by that. They want to live in a fake world which excites them and not the calm real world. Unlike earlier, now I am bent on becoming a better understander than forcing others to understand."
Love You Druv ❤️❤️❤️
"I always wanted to break the gender stereotypes in relationship and marriage. For example, why should height or age or income or man should be always more than woman. I always hated that. I dream of doing the opposite"
Please make a video on Adolf Hitler's life my request stay blessed

"Bollywood ke liye nanga hona,sarab pina, sigaret pina boyfriends banana,hi feminism he"
Great.. thanks for such information
"Dhruv rathee manipulating other people without showing full information ℹ️ Such a shame, dhruv rathee shame on you 👎"
"Your mention of Neena ji's comment was not suited to context here. I heard the entire statement she made and it was not entirely wrong as she meant the how men and women are different when certain practical aspects of society are concerned. She gave an example of her being unable to leave for an early morning flight without any male accompanying her because of security concerns. It is sad that what she said was right but that's the present we live in. Can hope the future changes.
Other than that, i liked your video and logicals were on point."
Gender neutral laws bhi banne chahiye kuch cases me....

You never fail as a guide to many … !!!! This video was much needed !! Amazing content dhruv👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
"Even if a girl is feminist, she seeks traditional qualities in a man. Like ability to earn more than her, leadership dominant and decisive etc.

Will women choose average men? Even if she claims to be feminist?"
What about politics on men vs men or men vs women or in home and outside by negative people!
"One video on farmer case!!
Want to know all about that"
Dhruv rathee is such a hypocrite person shame on you 👎
Love you sir ❤️❤️
"Thank you Dhruv for this Video.

bhai feminism bahut badiya ideology ha but feminist galat ha
Thanks for info
"I am a 16 year old boy , this video has changed the way I I think about feminist"
Bro dropped a trap with thumbnail and title to attract patriarchs and they got bamboozled
"It's all about controlling each other behaviour according to yourself,and government play supreme role in making of a society"
"I think the word ""feminism"" gives the opportunity to be framed as being related to something that only benefits females and tries to suppress males. And so it is easier for some stupid to make people believe that feminism is meaningless."
Bahut se YouTubers ko content mil jayega ab😂
I bet you will be awarded with Nobel price soon
"""Toxic Feminism"" both word are same, like ""Solar Sunlight""🤓"
In our state there is one inequality to boys that if girls will score low in NEET examination they have 50% Reservation they have nothing with boys.this is injustice why anybody dont care and talk about this 😢.both should be given equal rights.
"Ab Bhai ko feminism ke naam par views chahiye 😅😅,,,"
"Dhruv rathee you are such a hypocrite person, shame on you 👎👎"

"As a 17 year old boy, I've always came across the wrong definition of Feminism such as Neha Dhupia meme or those stupid films. I also did not believe in Feminism because I was confused but this video gave me a lot clarity to this topic. Thanks and Now, I can proudly say that I'm a feminist and would try to educate my friends about it"
Saab kuch chalega lekin no seal no deal will remain same (for both sides)
दिक्कत फेमिनिज्म से नहीं है। दिक्कत है औरतें अपनी बाॅडी को एक ऐसेट्स समझती है। जबतक औरतें अपने शरीर को ऐसेट्स समझना नहीं छोड़ेंगी तब तक औरतें हकीकी आजादी हासिल नहीं कर पाएंगी
Hello
Calling a bastard dog legendary author... Shame on you
DHRUV SIR APKO VIRGINITY AUR NO SEAL NO DEAL JAISE CHEAP TOPICS KE LIYE BHI EK CLARITY VIDEO BANANI CHAHIYE...FOR EXAMPLE WO LADKE JO SHAADI KE PEHLE SEX KARTE HAIN PAR UNKO BIWI BEDAAG CHAHIYE HOTI HAI
Dhruv rathee is such man telling everyone that you have to remain slienced if anyone hurt you and doing conterversy with elevish

Equal rights paane ke liye aapko equal hona zaruri nahi hai...💯
Our Religion Islam gives us the best education about women's and men's rights. and Allah and we Muslims don't force anyone for our religion. Alhamdulillah!
Thank you Dhruv ❤️
"This man being fantastic as always, You never disappoint 🤞❤Hats off to you man🙌 You've earned my respect.
To make a video on a topic like this is really appreciated and thank you for making this. this is important for the people to understand this who supports patriarchal thinking.
Keep working hard 🤟"
love you sir so much for your valuable vedio😢😢😢
Feminism is al over the world btw if you listen about andrew tate's controversy
this video is just a way to correct the defination of feminism....but actually this thought of feminism is going out of control...in schools we know that girl are not beaten even they have commited a big mistake as boys as the reason that they are the future mothers and will give birth to healthy babies and should not be beaten.....but the truth is that they are not beaten beacause of this beti bachao and beti padhao scheme....it is just a begining.....slowly this history will be repeated but this time men will fight for thier rights.....this world has not learned a lesson from history..and is going to repeat this mistake again.....SUCH CRUEL WORLD.....SUCH SHAME!!!
Bhai ki video pe BJP ki advertisements 😊
"Error spotted: 2:09 he has shown women heavier on the balance, which actually displays that they have more rights"
Ye feminism to ho gaya. Par ye caste system aur reservation ka kya??? Open caste ka kya.

How quietly you equated all problems of women to hindusim. You're a real ash hole MF
What an eye opening video....very well researched....deserves to be reached out to masses....hats off to you .....salute....
Finally I understood feminism😊 thanks DHRUV RATHEE❤
Society is the root of all trouble  😤

Nice video bro
"I don't know about Feminism. But I know that you are all who talk about Human equality, they have to know that Mans and Woman can not be equal every field. But I think you think from above. If we want to talk about the equality of men and women, we have to come back to the ground level and then talk. I will give you an example otherwise you will not understand. Example: (I used to work as a worker at the new thermal power plant in Rampal in Bangladesh and I used to pull a cable 30 to 40 meters from the ground and it was as thick as a hand. 
When it comes to equality, girls have to work here too and I don't think that a girl who makes people work in a place that talks about feminism is a man.) So I think that men and women need equal rights, but don't come to talk about equal rights everywhere. If you want to come and work in a place like me, then I will accept your words.
 I hope you will see my comment. Thank you"

Dhuruvv bhaiya you are indeed a great person hope to talk you. In the person one day 😊😊 very nice and satisfied explanation
"Always hindu sculptures.  , 
Apne hairs kisi ko mat dilkhaoo , what about these ...broo

But way of explainning is awesome"
"it's impossible that everyone will get about it , mostly educated people will watch this video but in villages it will never happen (sad but true) :("
Yes they are
"Really amazing to watch this video fully ..what all points you have discussed here all logically correct ...patriarchal mindset or feministic mindset, it shouldn't hurt the humanity in today's world..there is a lot to change in our society specially our built up mindsets which discourage someone's rights or ideas just for being a man or woman ( a boy or a girl ) ...And the video was more informative..Thank you sir 🙏🙏🙏"

"14:48 यहाँ मैं असहमत हूँ । यह नही है कि रोने की स्वतंत्रता नहीं है पर रो रो के खुद को पीड़ित दिखाना और सहानुभूति बटोरने के लिए उलाहना देना- ये बकवास और धूर्त व्यवहार अपनाने की स्वतंत्रता नहीं है। infact ,victim play करने की freedom किसी को भी नहीं होनी चाहिए male or female."
Ek video in chapri logo pr
Changed thumbnail 3 times in 24 hrs 🤡💀💀 tells a lot about the audience here
"The incident where a girl slapped a boy raises an important question:                                         Do feminists support boys in such situations, or are they against girls?                               How many feminists stood against the injustice in the Jasleen Kaur case?                                You are very good at changing the way of thinking in the wrong direction."
❤❤
thank you for speaking about it..i hope the videos reach their original viewers who need to know about REAL Feminism.. Patriarchy is cancer to society..
Well said....  Its good to see you explained this topic so clearly....  Thank you Dhruv ❤
"Dhruv as you make videos on 9/11 ,Pulwama Attack so could you make a video on the 26/11"
👍👍👍👍
When dhruv didn't sponsered kuku fm till 15 min i was like how's that possible but then suddenly he promoted and for no reason i was like yes yes😂😂
After watching your video i support feminism
What a simple way of understanding the topic ...kudos❤ great job Dhruv 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
DHRUV SIR.  FEMINIST KA MATLAB YAH BHI TO NAHIN HAI NA KI  KOI FEMALE PUBLIC PLACE PER BIKINI PAHAN KAR GHUME AUR AGAR USKO KOI BOYS DEKH LE TO USSE  CRITICIZE KIYA JAAYE 😊
Very well observation...very true

Great
HUMANITY>>>>ANYTHING
Aisa Maharashtra me nahi hota sabhi ko same hak hai Maharashtra me ❤
Increasing feminism making man unemployed
Equality Humanity ❤
"From 11:00 I thought Dhruv would share something practical, something about the reality of the society. But all he explained was a utopia. Women don't think this way, sir. A few things are evolutionary.

In General, I like Dhruv's videos."
One of the best video on YouTube
Pheli baar kush acha kaam kiya good topics
Your video editor needs recognition too.. he's cooking man 🔥
Really something logical
I am 15 years old but I am also feminist ❤
"That ledy in video clip visited a school in my village. She said girls should marry as soon as possible, her husband will take care of further education. Sadly in consecutive 2 years, many of girls in my village got married and out of them only one girl manage to study and got a job. She changed the scenario of girls education in my village for a decade almost."
Thanks brother 🎉
"Why can't feminism be just called equality? 
When we say all castes are equal, we dont call it Dailitism... we call is equality and casteism.
When we make the thing specific to one side, the other side, starts to become portrayed as a bad actor.
Would have been great if you covered Masculinity as well. Toxic feminism and toxic masculinity as well... covering entire scope.

Your view points on gender equality is bang on, but your viewpoints on everyone being able to do everything is incorrect. Majority of men cannot be caretakers, hence majority of nurses are women(its not a societal structure alone, its their strength), just as majority of women are not territorial and aggressive(which puts them in disadvantage) when it comes to roles which demand it. 

Trying to portray it as Black & White helps in engagement building, but facts and reality are always in shades of gray."
"I don’t mean to be rude, but this is a funny thought: shouldn’t monkeys have the same rights as humans, since they share many physical and genetic traits with us? lol"
What about anti men laws in the Indian constitution? Indian men are suffering so much
Truly standing ovation for you....... we need more men like you......❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢🎉❤❤❤❤❤😊
Feminism is also a type of discrimination.we should go for gender irrelevance
conclusion- aurat hi aurat ki dushman hoti hai🙂
"@dhruvrathee 
Bro i think your arguments are baseless. Feminism wants equal rights for men and women whereas according to our constitution women have more rights than men. Women trap Men in fake cases becauses they have special rights. Many lives got destroyed because of such women because nobody will believe that a women has done something wrong or abused a man. The alpha males you are calling Chapri are actually criticising such Feminism because it ultimately meant equal rights. You can see in a video the woman is slapping a man and nobody is stopping her but if that would have slapped just once in return public would have start beating him or he could have been sent to Jail. If you are such humanist then reply to me  otherwise it's obvious that you are one of those fake feminists who make such videos to get view"
"Bro accept he is feminist,"
Incredible video real and in-depth knowlege .
saying as a boy      feminist is not the problem but toxic feminist is the problem   ex- like for you bjp supporter is not the problem but  andhbhakt are the problem
And I was thinking I can expect a constructive video from a liberal.. smh
This was much needed! Being a woman it really hurts to see people trolling us on social media & glorifying misogynistic movies. Thank you brother for opening the eyes of many!
Bhai yaha Democracy khatrey me hai aur tu Feminism & Patriarchy par baat kar raha h.

"Video is appreciated but the fact that men and women are different can’t be argued against. Again, differences are there but discrimination should never be tolerated."
Wow! itni achi explanation aapne ❤ thank you
"Feminism has been a cancer since its inception. 

Feminism was never about ""equality."" It was always about reparations, retribution, and restitution against men by using the govt.

The fact is that, instead of feminism, we should use the word gynocentrism. Gynocentrism is the root cause of all problems.

Masculinity is not for the feminine to define. Because men and women are not interchangeable widgets."
Amazing video ❤❤❤❤❤
"Hey Dhruv, the video was really good, but there were some things missing here. For example, the current laws where a father can't even get a DNA test done should have been addressed. On the other hand, under the guise of feminism, how many boys are accused and trapped should have been discussed. If a girl accuses someone, they are thrown straight into jail without even taking their statement. This is something that should have been talked about too."
"I measure the progress of a community by the degree of progress which women have achieved.

We want bhabhiji's view on this.
Dhruv RatheeFeminism
"Why dont you talk about false 498a , false DV , false rape cases ...what will u call it patriarchy or feminism or matriarchy. 
I am sure you will not so any video on millions of innocent men facing false charges where they are declared criminal just on verbal statement of women that he asked for dowry or he asked for sex or anysuch false statement is sufficient to put innocent men behind bars ......i will really appriciate if you make vidoeo on such false cases  of 498 , DV and false rape cases .."
Islam is the biggest feminist religion ❤
"“Everybody talks about Women's Rights✅✊🏻
but Nobody talks about Women's Wrong ❌🌚”"
Earlier I think there is no red strip on women's eyes in the thumbnail but now it is . Am I right?
"Dhruv bhai, yeh to insan ki fitrat hai, Female ho Animals ho Gareeb ho Bachhe ho jo bhi weak hain unko dabaya jaata hai exploit kiya jaata hai .... Par Yeh galat hoga kisi ek ko aap victim banao!! Aap insano ki iss fitrat ke upar kuch bolo.... aise kisi ek victim ko support kar ke aap bhi to hypocrite ban rahe ho!!!"
Islam gives equal rights man and women
"Dhanyawad Dhruv, love you from the bottom of my heart ❤"
Puree video dakh li lakin Kuch samij ni aye😂😂😂😅😅
Everyone should know the real meaning of Feminism ❤
"Fk patriarchy and patriarchal dumb f*ks. Patriarchy never served men. It made us act like machines. No emotion, no kindness act like a f*king  machine. When i was 16, 17 years old i came across many fake and made up videos about feminism. My thoughts changed when i met men and women who adhered to the true feminism. Which preached for equality and in many cases they even cared for mental health of men. In my experience, the men i grew up with, most told me to toughen up and not to cry cause i should act like a MAN and not show emotions. Most women in my life, told me i could cry and show what i feel. They never judged me. They asked me how i felt. ❤"
Men of Quality are not afraid of equality.
Your videos are too addicting I am just addict to it and I just love your videos thank you Dhruv sir ❤
He literally changed the thumbnail 3 times 😂
Day after day my respect for dhruv has increased
Eagerly waited for this topic on your channel. Well explained. Hope many of us got to know what feminism actually is and what not.
dhruv rathee never leaves without roasting instagram chapris 🤣🤣
Mind-blowing sir
Aab kuch Chapri Aayenge Or bolenge Systum Systum 😁😁😁😁😁
You missed dr Ambedkar’s contribution towards women
Ai generated image are not good
"Bro thanks for telling us about the feminist, up till now i was unaware about feminism, like i was having a very little information or you can say that i have been mis- guided about it but after this vedio,I know about it.Great Job🎉"

Still you not explain the movies thank you for coming and etc in detail like you explain the animal movie
"Dhruv rathe: Berojgaar ladke ko yaad karo.
Me: khudko yaad karliya"
Best explanation 👍
Feminism bol bolke ladko ka job aur rights dono chinn rhi hai ladkiyan samaj aur politians
"Whatever the literal meaning,
Real feminism doesn't exist anywhere.

Feminism's purpose is to establish ""Matriarchy"" and Hypocrisy"" in our country.
Patriarchy is never good for us, but when did matriarchy (fake feminism) become good ?
And In 2024 Feminism is not interest for Women/Equality.
Feminism is in the interest of Worldwide business.

Any right wing, left wing or any anti national like you, everyone is part of this business."
Yeh sab chodo Dhruv Rathee world Me kya world war 3 hune jaa rahi hai india me farmer protest karre uspe vedio banaou yeh sab konsi topic pe banare hu bhai godi media ne shayad warning diya kya 😂

Why you didn't mention about muslim community ?
Ek hi video me bhai me 4 thumbnail badal diye 😂
😂😂😂😂😂
❤❤
"when Netflix giving him money for decode breaking bad , money heist and gangs of  Wasseypur like movie and series and calling money heist a perfect crime and  gangs of Wasseypur a modern cult classic in which they show drugs , heist  and extramarital affair and lot more illegal things and  he okay with that because he get  paid for that and this time  Netflix forget him that's why he is pissed from animal and making dedicated video to criticize it, however i also support equality and it is must , and i am not in favor that movies spoils people if  it is right than money heist  breaking bad ,  gangs of Wasseypur has more run time than animal  so stop being pussy man grow up  and at last gender equality is  must .."
Hats off to you 🫡
"Feminism ka asli matlab kisi ko pata hi nahi hai... Jo ""chapri gang"" logo ke bare mein aap baat kar rahe hai, unme seh Kai ladkiya bhi hai jinko feminism ka matlab bhi nahi PTA hai..... Aisa nahi hai ki ladke nahi chahte hai equal rights, ladkiyo ko bhi samajhna chahiye true feminism kya hota hai... 3rd wave feminism mein misinformation and misrepresentation hoti hai isiliye ""Men are dogs"" narrative ko barava diya jata hai.... INFORMATION seh zyada NARRATIVE ko barava diya jata hai.... Yeh hai society ka asli problem, same case, race and religion mein bhi dekha gya hai... Sabka apna alag narrative hai, aur usi ko leke misrepresentation hoti hai."
You are guiding people ...improving their understanding...nice videos
definitely a great video Dhruv sir you cant be wrong with the amount of research you do this masculine society never wants equality truly amazing BUT except India where we call women a Goddess the in countries like USA humans are not the same as of our culture definitely women there misuse feminism please make a video on the scams that chapri women do in those countries and how we can avoid our country ending up the same manner @dhruvrathee
The video was really good.. but one name you forgot to mention when it comes to feminist.. and  i.e. B. R. Ambedkar.. m surprised that you did not talk about him..
You are giving what society needs.... Thank you Dhruv Sir...🙏
This is 4th thumbnail 😂mene dekha h 😂 is video ko bar bar bus kro bro kitna mehnat kroge 😅
Divorce par video banao
The current depiction of feminism in today's society isnt what feminism actually means
"Fuxk feminism ,they just uneducated frustrated bitxhes"
"You were completely one sided on feminism yes feminism was born for a good cause but you never mentioned about toxic feminism and matriarch except only the definition. If you say women are equal in front of men then why professions like military personally,special forces, political leader, labours, engineers,manufacturers are all men"
U deserve 15 million....!!
This opened myy eyes for feminism
Jaise video start Kiya BJP ki advertisement aayi 😂
Make a video on men’s mental health.
Lekin toxic feminist ka ky ?
Yes finally someone explained thiss>>>>>
This video should be taught in schools.
"I rarely comment on any videos but I really want to thankyou for this video. 
When someone asks me to explain feminism or to justify my emotions against their patriarchal behaviour, it makes me feel so angry and helpless to be honest. How can something which is so logical and simple be so difficult to understand. The reason is simple- people who talk about fake feminism more than feminism were sexist from the very beginning. 
So yes, sometimes I try to explain, sometimes it's too hard so I get angry instead, and sometimes I just tell them that you are wrong and should read up on it because I am not going to spoonfeed you the information.
So ladies, I know it takes a toll on you..but let's go deeper in it..feel worse about the society but also stay positive within because change is happening and changes will happen for the good. 
There are feminists, men, who don't feel insecure everysingle time someone talks about feminism, who don't feel attacked, women who don't feel like they are betraying their better halves while talking about this. 
Once I was explaing about women rights to one of my friends and she tells me after listening to everything that yes all of that is fine but you can't hate on boys and should speak about them as well. And I was so surprised because I genuinely thought that she was getting me. I reminded her that literally nothing I had said had ANYTHING going against men particularly. It's the society. If that society comprises of those men (sexist) too then why should we be shy to speak up against them? Secondly there is absolutely nothing wrong in talking about men suffering from the patriarchal society, because they do..a lot! But saying ' talking about their sufferings' in response to women's suffering is just kind of comparing the two and taking no responsibility and sort of saying shut up and stop whining. Why can't we talk about both.
 Feminism also doesn't mean that if I have 10 mins to say something, I give five to women and 5 to men. That is so stupid! Somedays I can talk entirely about men and somedays entirely about women and that doesn't make anyone a lesser person. i can talk about women's rights for hours and it's FINE. it's needed. We are all in the same boat. Men are suffering without them realising that they are suffering. 
And being a women, explaining the most basic of the things..I can only imagine how many more years it will take for things to even come anywhere closer. 
So ladies please start getting offended and asking the right questions xD"
I was hesitating at first to watch this video because of the thumbnail but now I am relieved to know that Dhruv is inspiring as always
Professor dhruv rathee❤
Thank you sir ❤❤
Dhruv rathee is a masterpiece
"Women can get sex easily, cheating is an easy thing for ladies. Thats not the same case for men."
"Current affairs gives a different view. I never saw a feminist stand against laws which are made to punish hard working innocent men. Look at the number of fake cases file against men, look at the amounts that Shikar dhawan and Shami had to pay and social embarrassment. Those are hard working men no feminist never had them as role models instead why feminists choose people like Karan Johar over Shami or Shikar. How would you explain current events @dhruvrathee ? Equal rights starts with equal laws. Instead of equal seats in the parliament ask for equality. I understand you glanced over men’s loneliness but it was an area to be explored and you should research on those topics you can release a playlist instead of a video."
Ekta kapoor roasted😂😂
Finally someone being logical about the true meaning of feminism !! Keep it up brother it's really eye opening for the upcoming generation.
आपने अच्छा explain किया । धन्यवाद
"Skill kaise badhaye sir is par koi video banaiye

"I am in class x before this video I was just studying a chapter name gender, caste and religion. After this video the concept of feminist and sexual division(public division\private division) is clear. 

I would like to thank you dhruve rathee for such a concept clearing video."

"Dhruv sir , there are many cases where womens have raped mens but , there is no proper law to punish these type of women , i am not saying men are not bad , there is no equality in law system and punishment for this toxic rape cases ."
Next video - girls period❤please o
please make video on Pakistan politics                              please
I am feminist
❤❤❤
"a great video Dhruv, indeed a great video, very very very informative...
BUT
Would have been far better, if you had added another section, ane called out all the people who actually believe in the same thoughts that you explained in the video also if you had added a conversation with like-minded people in the video, and proposed a systematic approach for people, so that they can lead the change around them starting from their families.
I know that change would be hard, especially in joint families but in nuclear families where both the in charges (husband and wife) are in charge of decisions, it can lead to a ripple effect and lead to a better society.
I know it would make the video much longer and that probably won't be good for your channel.
But I'd really appreciate if you could make a second part and include such solutions too...
Regards"

Nice catch sir ........thax to make this video 🎉
Toxic feminity is as dangerous as toxic masculinity

"A Film I would like to add in Best Feminist Films is ""Mahanagar"" by Satyajit Ray."
"Nothing to give feedback. Video has its own perfection, but as i focus and Interest in development it is really necessary to expand the enviroment of the education , freedom , self choice and of course humanity."

Hats off to you
"I am a 22  year old boy , this video has changed the way I  think about feminist and all , thank you So Much  dhruv sir"

Feminism का मतलब समझ आया करण यहाँ है कि भारत है कहीं ना कहीं संस्कार है मंगलसूत्र है भरोसा है और आज़ादी भी और लोकतंत्र है सब कुछ करने के लिए आगे बढ़ने का अधिकार है बस बेरोजगार से शादी नहीं करते 😊😊😊 😊😊
Give this man a Nobel already❤
So basically everyone's english is not correct
"Guys, You may or may not agreee with me but A family, Govt. Or Organization runs properly when a certain person take control over a certain thing and thats totally acceptable and necessary thats why women are chosen for handling household responsibility and men for outside work. Both responsibilities have their own set of challenges... Women are good in organizing tasks sensibly while men needs to be tough all the time. No doubt girls are also tough and physically strong but A man can lift 400 kg while women are limited to 200Kg.. why?  Obviously There are restrictions made by god and nature which should be okay."
"Buht sari bakwas logic se bhari pari hy yy video.

Par women ke pas hai to equal rights
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
"12:19 but,  ya bhi to equal rights chati hye, patriarchal thinking bhi rakhti hye..  And aj kal jeyadater ladkia feminist word ka missuse kerti hye"

This country needs more men like you Dhruv ❤
Feminism term is wrong. We don't need it's Asli Matlab. We need to be human.
You are a gem❤

This video is a definition of masterpiece ❤
"Indian feminist me Ambedkar ka naam bhul gaye bhai.

"Why these all Terms About social standard such as 'feminism, Patriarchy ' have to use from other language...jinka matlab hi jaldi samjh naa aye???"
This topic gets  totally manipulated and misunderstood by various platforms..well explained dhruv 🙌👏👏
Please also make video on 10 th class board exam and the pressure they face because of career 😞
No one is against feminism but there are few female who themselves interpret it in a wrong way. In the name of feminism they do uncivilised things. Be just a good human…that should be one’s only priority.
Neha Dhupia is a Matriarch. I don't think she is feminist by your clip.
Legends know the thumbnail was changed 🗿🗿🗿🗿
Today is there alot of misconception about word Feminism. Especially Feminism is becoming the reason of hate alot towards Women. But thankyou Sir for introducing the real meaning of Feminism.
"Great work really evolved my mindset
Thank you so much ❤"
"Men and women are not equal 
First time i found your video baseless"
A real man will always be a faminist.
Every Indian citizen should watch this and learn this.
Narcissistic Relationship aur Abuse par video banao...
No men are completely against the idea of feminism. But the problem comes up when 'pseudo-feminist's overthrow the actual feminist ideologies and imposes illogical and antimale actions.
Then read the life of Prophet Mohammed s.a.w.w he is the one who started feminism

3rd time thumbnail changed 👀

Feminism is bullshit
"12:03 apna biwi bhi wahi bolegi, ""mera uper kha raha hye tu"""
Believe me or not but equality is an illusion.
"Bro really again discrminated masculinity and supported feminism ,in short he wants a world of strong women and soft boys ,
Men are brave and women have more rights than man in india ,and dhruv really said a man and a disabled man are equal  😂😂😂😂😂
They both have different rights even they both are men 
And people who still think men and women are equal  
Take a look on america 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️masculinity is ending there , once a super power country now begging in front of other countries"

"Lol, utterly nonsense...  if you say men and women are similar because they have 75% similarities, like eyes mouth and ears lol then what about monkey they are also similar to us 😂😂 they should be given equal rights or maybe a disabled person are as equal but obviously they deserve special rights... I disagree with you on this video"

Pls sir make video on farmer protest 2.0
👏👏 perfect
"Be careful what you wish for. If you go with the textbook definition (original) of Feminism, many will agreed to it. However, the present 3rd wave feminism is totally different. Many original feminists also reject the present day feminism. The present day feminism is totally EVIL in nature. Its not about equality anymore but totally a men hating cult, destruction of family values (nuclear family), promiscuity in women as empowerment, promoting single parenthood, choosing career more than raising your own kids and many more. Please do some more research before you believe anything Dhruv said. He spin this argument in totally different (intentional) way and PLEASE do your own research on the present day feminism. Check what the western countries are going through because of the 3rd wave feminism. I believe everyone is equal and should be given equal opportunities. However, i dont believe in equal outcome. Anyone should be judge of his/her merits and not because of whats between their legs. The 3rd wave feminism cannot even define a WOMEN. Don't just blindly believe what someone said on the internet BUT DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH."
Best Youtuber I've ever seen ... More power to him

Bhai itna bhi leftist mat ban😂
Now this's called real CHAD🗿. Hats off to you Dhruv
It's worth watching Dhruv Sir ' s every single video. We learn alot from your videos ❤
Legendary author Salman Rashidi? Why is Dhruv Rathee exacting his status?
chapri people in any social movement not only un relate to it but also use this to earn followers. I think we should not even consider chapri in this serious discussion.
Dhruv bhai I'm big fan but ek chixz me kehna chahunga ye baki sari baate thik hai lekin ek chiz hai ki ladki agar jada par likh leti hai to haat se nikalti hai wo kisi ki izzat nhi krti hai usse lagta hai wo aone maa bap se v jada achhi ho gai h par likh kr ye scah hai or practically me maine dekha hai samne se bohoto ko
"What Dr.B.R Ambedkar did for women in india????

"I disagree on many things with u , but I think u have done a good job explaining true meaning of feminine , I would recommend you to add psychological and physiological reason more precisely and evolution too and debunk the myth around that."
Like china India ko bhi single child ka law lana chahiye…..apne aap equality a jayegi…..nothing more to do ……we followed this in our house…we are three siblings and we all have single child….

Dhruv rathi ❤❤ always right ❤
Thank you so much sir  you are a legend 🙏🏻❤ now I know what is the meaning of feminist exactly 💯👍🏻

Men and women can't be equal.They are unique in their own different ways
what a damn good episode.
Thumbline is editing
"Ladkiyon ko ghar me hee band karke rkhna sahi hai , and you can see that what's happening in society when these bitches has stepped out in our world"
I feel the problem is most of the people don't relate feminism with equality because the term itself starts with femine.... It should have been called Equalism or something.
Everyday I'm learning something new
Thumbnail change kar ke aukaat dikha di😂😂😂
"Really life changing video for all...

Mind boosting video...

Really nice..."

"how wonderfully explained feminism!! thanks for getting everyone's basics right.... ...... However, it may take ages for the right thinking to permeate in society. Hopefully, this would be a flagbearer vlog, thanks Dhruv!!"
There are no differents between you and click bait users. Shame on you
Bro tm cancer lag re ab mujhe
Dhruv video is good but i was expecting more from you. Like giving reply to andrew tate arguments and other people.
Bhai Farmers protest pe video bnalo Bht nainsaafi ho rhi hai kisaano ke sath
"Thumbnail has been changed 3 times,i think something is wrong with this video"
"When life is at stack feminism vanishes,ukrainian male are inhabited to go in a war but female are free to leave the country do wherever they want,no feminist demanded equal right here saying female also need to go to war"
Even being a 9 grade student I have freinds whom with im open about and I suggest mwn to make freinds who they can share their feeling and urges openly . Ive been in school from  1 class and know almost whole school but only have 5-6 freinds who Im open with .  Make freinds that understand you not those who make you cool etc
watching dhruv video is like investing your own knowledge ❤ <33
Yes men and women are different and both are important . Its like ying and yang . Two faces of a coin. One cant live without the other . Great episode Dhruv ❤
"Hum ladke ladki par haath nahi uthate the soch ke ki aurat weak hai, agar barabar hua toh kya unko bhi public mein maar sakte Hain agar usne Hume mara"
"Problem is that most feminists equate all the toxic aspects with feminism.. In day to day life, we don't see mature, sensible people. Following the correct definition of feminism as you mentioned. You perhaps haven't spent time with the masses to realise what exactly is propagating at the lower level.. No rational person like you mentioned, can ever be against women rights.. But excess of anything is never right.."
Divorce & Break up are the harshest thing for a man in this world.Thanx for the feminism educated people at least accept these things .Male & female are complementary to each other who make the liveable toxic free world.
Chiii

"Feminism is cancer for the society. 
If you are a man then act like a man . Adverse effects of feminism is destroying american and European society. Don't allow this feminism bullshit in india . Only hardcore patriarchal societies can win the struggle for existence. Men and women are born different. 
If you are a man then becoming strong is the only option you have. 
Long live patriarchy."
"Bro's literally trying to supply where demand is higher. 

He's passionate businessman, he loves his job.

And the thing is bro researched network [ Network is a thing accepted & created by society(society means majority  of people) ]. That's why he's being taught by so called society (which is brainwashed by some people).

Somethings he just said is complete against the will of Universe. And the people who loved this video is because they trust this man because he gained trust of other people.

The thing is Patriarchy is intellectually equal for human beings."
Sir please make a video about Sir Mahatma Gandhi and Nathuram Godse 🙏

Very nice video 🙏🙏🙏❣️❣️❣️💯✔️
May your  soul rest in peace
This YouTube channel is only for the people who thinks
"So sadly 
Government of India And Our Constitution in some ways is not totally Feminist
Because They Gave Women Some Very Extraordinary Rights
Like If A Girl Went To Police And File A Real Or Fake Case Against a man related to sexual harrasment
Then, no one will listen to that men and he will get arrested
There is law that 
If a man prove in court that her wife is torturing him and bit him a lot and so he is taking divorce
Still he needs to pay her alimony, Why? 
Just because he married to her 🤔🤔
I'm not against to bring women forward or any thing 
But what if they misuse their rights"
"Schools mei bhi boys ko teacher hamesha punish karte hai , marte hai aur bohot daate hai... 😢

Aur ladkio ko padhane samay daatenge nahi , na punish karenge aur nahi kuch bolenge ulta unka saath dete hai chahe galti bhale he ladki ki ho😢

Unfair.. aur jab ek baar maine bola ki sir aap partiality kar rahe hai to unki bolti band ho jaati hai 😢.... 

Sad reality"
What about power of sex. Why women can get sex easily and not men. This should too end.
"Love you Bhai, I am also a feminist"

"What about Jyoti Prasad Maurya?? What about the female who cheats their husbands by doing hookups when they are not home?! Just check the status, about it, Dhruv, being feminist is a good things for both the genders but, think about the men who got cheated after being feminist, these women also come under the umbrella of this feminism. Say about it also in this sort of video.. Dhruv you are the most intellectual youtuber but, see this thing and reflect on it also in your videos.. its not about patriarchy or feminism, its about being respectful for both the genders. PLEASE REFLECT ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL!!"
Dhruv stop injecting western culture in 🇮🇳
Boring video

This is called a dark reality of our society 👍
I was a 12 years old if I remember correctly.....one colleague of Papa came home and he was discussing ki kaise unke bhai ka apni patni se panga chal rha...usne ek thappad mara to uski biwi ne mayke me btaya aur baat ka batangad rhi...I overheard that...and couldn’t control...Just said going there ki uncle agar whi aaapki bhabhi ek thappad palat kr aapke bhai ko maar deti fir??? Baat ka batangad to chhodo...kya hota koi imagine bhi nhi kr sakta...this is a long struggle...
"Me : As a feminist man, I believe in gender equality and support the idea of providing 16 weeks of maternity leave for all individuals. It is important to recognize and value the contributions of women in the workforce and allow them the time and support they need to care for their newborns.

Long live patriarchy
Great teaching
Make a video on husband and wife relationship skills.
"Its interesting how the defination of patriarchy has something like ""...controlled by men in which they use their power for their own *advantage* "" while defination of matriarchy has something like "".. women have most of the authority and power... Which belongs to women and is given so children..."" Sounds so convenient hm"

but now a days women take feminism  in otherwise just for their own sake...they use it wrongly
"When you dont relate with ideology just call them chapri....
The faults in your video
1.Lack of research
2.Prejudice about patriarchal thought 
3. already declaring one side as wrong without going deep into the subject matter.
4.And not highlighting the actual issue.
5. Total injustice to the topic highlighted.
You know what 
Seeken jigyasa is making far better vedios on same issue with a lot of research and detailed explanation.
Giving justice to the topic.
It's recommended to watch that video on the same topic and then compare the level of content."
"Sadly, there are still so many chapri alpha wanna be snobs out there"
Woww Dhruv Rathee is the best in explanations!!! Loads of love for your content 🇮🇳
"I think patriarchal mindset will much deep down when the boys of 20-30 yes today will become father

"Feminism is a morally right concept but it is misunderstood when women uses the word ""feminism"" to justify for irrational acts or speeches which are simply done to show dominance or due to there ego"
Girls should be a mother first.

Respect man
"Guys, just normalise using words like toxic feminity/masculinity and patriarchal/matriarchial mindset. I have been so disturbed by the way toxicity is trending. Things like toxic alpha and Sigma males/females, hating feminism, men getting hate from women, women getting hate from men and just general toxicity is trending and getting normalised. We gotta trend these things and wherever we see bs let's just call it out."
Nice
Thumbnail changed
as usual very well explained and very informative... keep it up Dhruv
"23:42 dhruv, i really like your analysis, you are an educated person and show it in your videos, your views about this issue are similar to mine, hope more people both male and female would understand this !"
Respect for you my brother ❤️👍
In today's world women has more advantages than men
"Oh my God Dhruv❤ How good you are , how courageous you are , it is easy for toxic people to spread their  discriminatory opinions but very difficult for good people to spread their good opinions... I genuinely pray to God to bless you🙏🏻 ... More love More power to you♥️"
Esliye pahle ke log..  ladkioo ko Ghar see  Nikalna  band thaa😂
"I highly disagree with your political views(and content) but this video was much better than your others and is balanced for the most parts (though i do have complaints about no mention of gender spacific and unequal laws that were lobied by feminists using emotional discomforts around r**e cases) 

Non the less it was still good
 i can't support modern day specifically internet feminists they are just opposite of those male teenagers doing the same things, they hate when others do it"
Informative as always 🔥
Thank you
Ye fir Hindu ko le ata example dene mein . When we talk of feminist it does not the women will be seen  wearing a tika and saree. What about Muslims women wearing hijabs . Isko chull hain
"Sir, 
App sochte hai na, Market main nikal k 5 Feminist ko dekhenge, Sir ka hi soch Badal jayega"

भाई जी आप भी मुझे पितृसत्तात्मक व्यक्ति लगते हैं मैंने भी आपकी वीडियो और ब्लॉग चैनल वाली वीडियो में भाभी जी को तो बहुत कम देखा है?
🙏👏🏻
It's such an informative video. Hats off to you Dhruv bhaiya for explaining the right meaning of feminism and the kind of feminism they talk about is being chapri not feminism. kudos to you🙌🙌
Aaj koi Muslim nhi dekh raha bolte hua ki as a Muslim i support this 😂😂
Thank you
Thank you sir …for this vdo it will help a lot ❤
Boards Wale presenty  lagao 👇
"I think feminism goes beyond equal rights and equality. There is a term called ‘Gynocentricism’ you should gave explored that too. Celebrating the difference instead of fighting for equality is better. My family taught me to treat females differently from male. They told me females deserve more respect, more love more compassion. So I treat females differently. And I am feminist."
But what about toxic feminism??
8:53 but vivian left you with a child
❤super bro
"2:50 salman Rushdie is not legendary dear dhruv Rathee,

BRo Make ViDeO oN MoNgoL EmPiRe !!
You told the positive side of faminism. Now make a video on negative side of faminism. And discuss how is it affecting our society and teenagers. And also tell the solutions how to save our childrens and youth from these.

I love this man❤
15:00 worst thing ever! Guys apko apne emotions jatane ka poora haq hai…jaise har ladki ko hai kyuki aap insaan hi to ho. Ap dhyaan rakho apki partner aisi ho ki wo apka dukh sune aur samjhe. 😊 and women are very good at it. Bas sahi partner chuniye
What about islam why you are targeting hindusim?

Thank you dhruv rathee I'm 17 years old and this video change my mindset thanks you ❤❤
"Thank you for such a sensible video. I would say I am a feminist, and I have huge respect and empathy for all the efforts of my husband and brother and the struggles they have to face in day-to-day's life. And I myself just want to be financially independent, and enjoy the co-existence of all the rational and kind hearted people, irrespective of their gender."
"Under these giant topics, there are many subtopics and at the end it becomes debatable. 

For example, Nowadays if a man earning 20k/month will get a partner earning 1 lakh/month?"
Who else have already watched the  vedio on Nikita thakur channel?like so that I can now
In short girls/women are the enemy of themselves
Best in world

Manipulation at its peak
"I hear feminism and patriarchy need the hour. But it is unable to understand. Finally, this video helped me understand."
"Men also have huge pressure to have higher status then women because women (working or not) don't choose men  of lesser status to marry or date, even if they choose that's very less %, and mostly they ultimately cheat or if not are always verbally abusing or taunting those men.
So the problems in your video are really surface level, its more deeper than that, a psychological problems.
If a women is being degraded, whether it's, mother, wife, sister not fighting back is indeed coward, if left once those same people will do again if lesson not taught properly tho I do agree most of the things in your video."
"Consider the following questions:

Despite advocating for feminism, why do some people still adhere to the tradition of the male being older than the female at marriage?

Although advocating for the abolition of caste distinctions, why do many individuals still engage in marriages within the same caste, often citing respect for their parents as an excuse? Furthermore, why do they continue to call Brahmins at the time of marriage, prompting reflection on the necessity of Brahmins in contemporary marital ceremonies?"""
Thanks sir

"Very well critically analyzed! Also, I found out that you are my senior from school. That's crazyyyy!! Love your work <3"
সব ঠিক আছে কিন্তু মহিলা দের equel রাইট দিলে সমাজে খারাপ প্রতিক্রিয়া দেখা দেবে । মেয়েরা সবসময় পুরুষদের নিচে থাকবে এটাই স্বাভাবিক ।  এক্সাম্পল কিছু বাড়িতে মহিলা সংসার চালালে সেই সংসার এ অশান্তি বেশি হয়।
the best state in india is kerala . am i carrect
Jay Bhim sirjiii 😊
"I cannot agree more with Dhruv sir. Every word was fabricated with others to give the most comprehensive view about the misconception of feminism in our society. Those people who happen to, unfortunately, mistake feminism for pseudo-feminism are none other than the ignorant people who voice their 'valuable opinion' on social media creating a choas. Lets normalise the fact that we need to do some research in topics and then come up with one's opinion. Else we all know half filled pot makes the most noise!
Thank you Dhruv sir for clarifying the most hot topics of these times which was the need of the hour."
Koi nhi chahta ki ladki aage nhi bare aagar aagar ladki sahi hai to ladki ko hum v ijjat karte hai support karte hai
Very good explanation
Its not men its women who do not believe in feminism. They want all benefits of equality but they don’t want the downsides of equality. The problem lies there
Bollywood promote misogyny + sexualising women. Bollywood must change these distracting concept
People often struggle to understand the true meaning of feminism.
Finally the Real thoughts released ❤❤❤

Bhai eqal right niii hi mile to shi h because auraten humesa galt use krti h rights ka isliye aurteo ko na hi mile
There is no feminism in India thats why rape happens everywhere largely in India
Ye bhi bta do bhai feminism me nam par ladkio ko kapro se azad karna Azadi nahi hoti or fir bhi agar feminist chahti hai ke ladkiyo ko azadi ho jo chahe kapre pehne to hmesha jab kapre utarne ki bat hoti to ye feminist in ladkio ke sath khadi hoti h or wahi par kuch ladkiya apne aap ko cover rkhna chahti ho or hijab phena chahti ho to ye feminist dikhai nahi deti dogle 😑
Dhruv bhaiya you are very informative to watch and a good utilisation of time ♥️... Thank you very much! 😙
"Don't call ""औरत"" it sounds cheap say ""महिलाएं"" या ""स्त्रियां"""
Aur log savitribai fule ko Shiksha ki devi na maanke Saraswati ko devi maante hai😢
Dhruv rathee do u know why u are growing faster towards the success this is becoz of your thinking
Social media has made it a man vs woman society when we actually need each other.
❤❤❤❤
"If you will be in all your consciousness i.e not in bed , not eating or drinking anything then by paying a careful attention on this video you can easily catch the level of misguiding of this dhruv rathee, 


Its obvious, this world runs on the carporate and money factors and not on feminist or masculinity . 


This point should be noted:- 
*No any father who is rich will think not to give education to his daughter,. This type of inequal distribution b/w home and office work  only exist in poor families 🫡"
Aise kaunse rights men k paas hai jo women k paas nhi hai?

I too a Feminist but mene mostly dekha ha k males kabi apne rights ka galat use nhi krte but on the other side females misuse their rights...meri merzi
For example agar koi actor soft n*de photo shoot krta ha toh wo galat and aggr koi actress aisa krti ha toh wo uski marzi
And 2 organs different hone se rights different nhi hojate"
CANT WE JUST BE HUMAN FIRST?
"😔Don't Destroy Your Goal for a Hole😔

Dhruv sir how had Albert Einstein discovered The Theory of Relativity? Please make a video on this topic.
Dhruv bhai u changed 3 thumbnails already😅
Boys hi boys ki dushman hay jese ladkiya ladkiyo ki dusman hoti hay
Most of them don't understand true meaning of feminism and they the preach like they know everything. This is a great video about true feminism and how it should be understood.
GOOD ONE DEAR DHRUV...HOPEFULLY BOLLYHOOD BAKWAAS PEOPLE WATCH THIS VIDEO
Mai agree karta hu apke baat par ko mard aur aurat ko barabri ka haq milna chahiye Jo khud islam ane ke bad Islam ne aurato ki diya hai shayad bht sare andh bhakt is par agree nhi karenge iske liye apko prophet Muhammad sallalau alaihi wasallam ki paidais se lekr unko last day tak padhna padega
Thumbnail has been changed
Helpful video for everyone 🎉
logo kahe na kahe larki jada kamati hai to lat mar k chali bhi jati hai admi ko

Dhruv bhaiya aapne ye to bata diya ki jo movies feminism ke naam pe dikhaya jaa raha hai ..usme asli feminism ni hai.....lekin ye con bataayega ki us type ki movies kaise Indian culture pe bad effect daal raha hai
I personally love this video
Equal right ki bat karo ego or revenge pe gyan mat do

"I Don't support feminism because womens are created differently their Physology,Anatomy,Mentality is different. I have a question why women and men can not play any sport's game together ????"
Ambedkar was also a feminist.  He was insightful and had a vision. Why didn't he talk about Hindu code by Ambedkar?!
Anything wrong are not supposed to happen to anyone and are not supposed to be done by anyone . As simple as that

"Kisi word ki definition kya hai se ghanta fark nahi padta. Uss word ko kistarha ki soch me istemaal kiya ja raha hai isse sab banta aur bigadta hai.

Feminism sirf apni definition tak hi unbiased and right cause ke liye hai. In reality, almost all those people who call themselves feminists, present womwn as victim and men as cruel. They discriminate and hate men, and put forth the definition of feminism just to defend themselves."
U hv double standard Dhruv
A general category handicapped man gets reservation in govt jobs but a normal man does not!!
He should be the education minister of our country
Extremely good!👏👏👏

"If you tell me Men are born to suffer but Women are born to be happy, Won't that be bad if Women take place in war and you see a Women fight in War, lot of traumatize they will face can they hold it? just think of the torture given to POW i.e (MEN) isn't that to be equal, do they mean Women should also face the same torture , Nooo why we can't we Men are not born to torture that are born to be happy. I know some do but it not same. We should face the problem on our own this is our training You can also see that your God( not goddess) suffer the most that what men are I'm younger that you all some women are taking equality to another level so I don't like it at all"
Feminism ka exact definition was given by priyanaka chopra in her interview

60% agree with u dhruv bhaiya
"Patriarchal soch ki baat nhi hai, common si baat hai jaroori thode hai ki har ladki ghar se bahar nikle. Agar koi ladki sahi mein cooking karna chaahti hai ghar sawarna chaahti hai tab to tum usko patriarchal soch ki bol doge. Jisko icha hai jaaye kaam kare lekin jaroori thode  hai ki sab hi kaam kare."
आपको जैसा समझाने वाला school teacher होना चाहिए जो बच्चो को subjects इसी तरह easy concept से समझा दे।
Men and women are not the same never will be but everyone needs equal rights. There are no fixed solutions just don't put men and women in competition.
Your argument is correct but sadly most girls today are learning feminism from sadak chaap actresses like Deepika Padukone who say its ok to sleep outside of marriage and other cheap Instagram influencers.
Your animal video was almost trash
"I love you Bhai

"If a girl call herself a feminist but she also involve in unethical offense toward man , then why Other feminist do not criticize her to use the title feminist for defend herself for retribution of her crime. Sometime Feminism causes overEmpowerment of women and Chances of disobedience amongs women for the truth will increase."
It is a best vid.

We should promote feminism but we shouldn't promote patriarchy and matriarchy.
bro conveniently  ignored all patriarchal examples of peaceful religion.
Very nicely explained
👍🏻
"mard aur auraat kabhi equal nahi ho sakte ,dono ki hi apni apni ahmiyat hai society aur life mein ,yes but respect and behavior sab ke liye male female transgender sab ke liye baraber hona chahiye"

Thank you so much for explaining...... 😅
"The biggest problem is thinking that ""FEMINISM"" is a gender specific word."
Me khud berojgar hu 😅😅😅
How misleading....you're basically indirectly comparing a toxic masculinity which is an extreme version of a basic masculinity with a basic version of feminism.....what about toxic feminism why are you not talking bout that which is actually a real thing not a fiction like animal movie.....atleast animal movie is a fictional character what bout the real world toxic feminist??
Being a student of sociology this was really helpful 🤝 thanks
Why you changed thumbnail 😂😂😂

Dhruv Rathee sir I need a one video for ... Doctor bhem rao ambedkar ... Ki unhone kaise kaise apni life mai struggle Kiya hai ... Starting se le kr end Tak ❤ please
Have any one thought in chess where it is open to both men and women only one women named judith have ever been in top ten(why).
"I really loved this video,i loved how explained everything with facts but in simple words,even i had trouble understanding some issues,Thank you so much .💖"
❤❤ Really changing my mind
The title of this video should have been. Masculinism
"Ok so no hate to Dhruv but 
When women are given the equal rights and the privileges of a man they misuse it. For example false accusations of domestic violence,r*pe and molest*tion or they want equal pay but don't want to do the equal amount of work. 
No one talks about the poor working conditions of a male laborer, the low wages but what are they talking about....... that how could man earn 20 lpa while a woman only earns less than lpa like no educational background check, experience, years of hardwork.
In ALMOST ALL THE CASES OF REAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE no one is actually supporting the man(whether he was the one who abused or got abused)."
bhaiya please delhi mein jin college teacher ko nikala gya hai cast ke case mein please uspr video bnaaooo jisse cast difference krne walo ki aankhein khule
Dhruv Rather are u feminist?
There are no such real meaning words about feminism. And there are no equal rights only equal opportunities.
❤
This is nothing more than a brainwash to the people who have little knowledge. You will only realise the reality when you get trapped in fake rape case or fake complaints.

Thank you for explaining the truth❤
Thankyou❤

Very crisp info. We ve come a long way  since Sati practice abolishment. But still long way away from patriarchal custom of women moving into inlaws house. After marraige the son and his wife has to move out of their parents house and start an independent family.
Before today I was fully unaware of the real meaning of frminism

if Dhruv Rathee is made PM of India ever, he will pass the ANTI CHAPRI ACTIVITIES BILL. His hate for Chapris is EPIC!"
Fantastic video Dhruv. Fighting toxic patriarchy has become the most difficult task for most women. You just made the dialogue much easier
😂😂 bro he targeted males in whole video despite of knowing that women's are more toxic ...
Why isnt it called Equalism?? This will always make me wonder
Dude you nailed it 🌼 the whole video is actual and real information

I agree with you❤
"well i dont agree with most of the things said in this video , i am not an alpha male or sigma and neither i want to be just to clarify"
"I believe in Feminism. but, there is a problem with modren feminism. If i see my relation with my mother and my kids relation with their mother its very different because my mother took care of me and i love her the most. but, my kids are attached to maids in that sense their mother is not much important to them because she is a professional women. I believe we should support our girls if they want to do something but, also teach them our values so that next generations can flourish. I don't believe in westren feminism where women is commercialized and a mother would not care about her children but, others' children for money, she won't clean her house but, others' for money, she won't stay with her husband and cheat with other men, thats all F ed up."
Just stop Rape and violence against Women we don't need more we can work hard for our career
"Thankyou very much sir .
Aapne iss topic ko samjhane ki kosis ki ummid h kafi log samjhe isse .

Mujhe kabhi kabhi iss baat par bahut afsos hota h ki karl marx jaise badhe thinker ko bina samjhe hi unke specific words use kar ke iss duniya ko do hisse me baat diya gaya .
Karl marx k sabse bade dushman toh unke followers hi hue jinhone unhe kabhi samjha nhi ..

And please kisi bhi ek group ki side maat lijiye galat sabke sath hota h ..chahe ladka ho ladki ho transgender ..ho 
samaj ek tarah ka dharna bana kar usse aane wale logo par thopti rehti h .. 
Magar humme padhna issliye h ki hum ek reasoned mind person ban sake aur ek dusre k sath behtar cooperate kar k rahe . 
I hope ki humara samaj bhi padhai ko issi najariye se dekhe 🙂🙂"
Tumhare pass inta bhi dimak nhi hai ki ye faltu ki baton ko तुझसे sun ki Janta सिख सके 😂😂

"Animal video- Dhruv against Men
This video - Dhruv defending women
According to dhruv men are the problem........In animal video he showed TOXIC masculinity but in this video he showed feminism not TOXIC feminism.....making no sense at all"
Plz ek video farmer's k liye banaye
My respect for him increased by 1 million %
Dhruv please make a video on the clothing industry and its impact on the environment.
"The current definition of feminism is man hating no matter if you believe otherwise, we all know how women already have same rights as men perhaps even more, I would say socially its not quite there but everything a men can do legally a women can well do as well.

I think you focused too much on toxic masculinity even though it wasn't title of this video, we know that its bad but perhaps you should also mention how feminism shouldn't be taken as reason to hate men in general.

Please don't incline towards either of the side too much balance is the key."
Dhruv please make a video on the clothing industry and its impact on the environment.
Dhruv please make a video on the clothing industry and its impact on the environment.

Tere Videos Mein Hamesha Hindus Kyu Target Hote h
Make a video to criticize wrong feminism...by criticizing some characters like neha dhupia
"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you 🙏 Dhruv. This was much needed.❤"
Bhaiya what about over women empowerment. Mens ke sath women’s kuch bhi galat kare women ko koi kuch nhi bolta law also help women. This is not we call equality. We want video on this topic
"there are many field where women can't have equal right as men....like sports, but they should get get equal right in office work etc where they can provide equal output ...we have to understand that man are women are different"
Every things has pro and cons ... dawn of feminism has giving freedom to women but but at the same time led to singlehood mindset in man.. feminism itself has brought many imbalance in relationship dynamics.. which you can see as divorse rate in socity beacuse of all those female rights they dont need man anymore for protection and security  but only their sperm for children.. and all the laws against man after divorse is obvious ...
par sir ye sab to kabhi theek hoga hi nahi .. 500 log change hojyege 1000 hojyenge kya pata 1 lakh log b change hojye ...lekin .. pura ka pura desh to anpd hi rhega is soch me.
Today the one & only utuber.....u are so right on everything..every topic....I have so much respect for u
Men illnesses is very very true.
Chapri gnag😅😅😅
Bro I don't understand the last clip that why we support the girl even though she slapped the boy in front of everyone.😮
"Bhai,, mera ek baat suno,, both men and women are not same"
"As a girl, I can say, I'm never against men rights, both should have equal rights..  the effort you've put in this video is incredible. Hats off to your team.. Eye opening message for society"
👍👍
"Whenever he says chapri gang
Meko wahi fanbase kyo yad ata hai😂"
"You should talk about both sides :-

If a girl behaves inappropriately, it's noteworthy that some other girls may support her under the guise of feminism. These things also portray faminism as a bad thing .so only boys are not responsible for the degrading name of faminism, talk about both sides.
Some feminist are also a think that they are superior compared to mens these things you do not address. That also portrays faminism the wrong way."
Too gud 🙂🙂❤️❤️
Sir mera kuku fm ko band karna hai

"Thank u for clearly explaining what is feminism, now I got to know what is feminism"
24:02 bharta me sab equal sabko apni ideology rakhne ka adhikar hai. Enlogo ko chapri bol kar discrimante nahi karna chahiye ha agar vo galat hai toh unse samjhaya ja sakta. Equality ko dekhte hue unhe chapri ya phir discriminated sabdo ka upyog karna bhi galat hai
The high tropic is issue
Thank you so much bro …. You changed my point of view regarding feminism ❤

"Some of the arguments are logical and true but there are restrictions for everyone. No one should be ""maadr peedr Azad""
I mean to say Adultery is not equal Feminism or patriarchy
I.e in the West most of the boys/girls have body count more than 1 even if they're not married.
Most of the couples have EM affairs which is disgusting and a threat to humanity. These idiotic things should not be equated with feminism."
Facts manipulated successfully
I respect you a lot man bro best of luck ❤❤
This video actually feels right!
Plzzz made a video on LGBT
But u didn't speak anything on female reservations.....this is also wrong girls ko to sab rights ab mil rahe hai fir bhi top institutes mein fee concession women reservation chalta hai aur ek deserving student piche chala jata hai .....ab to government ne tak women ko higher education free kar Diya! Kyu ladko ne kya paap Kiya hai I'm not saying I'm against it but equality laani hai to idhar bhi Lao........I think u can explain this better in your next video this is just my pov and I'm sure many people agree to this!
"Yeah well. This was expected from him. 99% of the times, the term  feminism is used is it's extreme sense. No one cares about the actual definition of feminism. And who can actually define what feminism is? Who has the right to correctly define feminism? So it's all bogus and we should see what this word feminism is actually doing to society."
Well I agree with 80 percent of the words you have said
You are a gem
"This video is excellent.
Every person should watch this."
"when you use Instagram too much, it makes you more toxic masculine or toxic feminist, when you ignore these topics then you understand both men and women are equal and important"
"I'm proud bewakoof, but feminist kabhi nai banunga.,"

Main Problem is that we don't know the real meaning of Feminism in India . Isliye so called Alpha male itna uchlate hai . Feminism ke term ko humesha galat hi dikhaya gaya hai now it's our responsibility ki uski awareness ho acche se . Thanks Dhruv For This Topic ❤❤
Well done boy 👏🏻💯🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 you are great 👍🏻
"Well i don't feel that we need these type of movements or ideologies and identify ourselves with it be it feminism or male chauvinism and i also agree that nobody has the right to justify cheating through this popular misconception that 'men will be men' or by woman such as 'kudiyo ka zamana' both are equally wrong in every sense and can't we ensure justice in every aspect i mean both genders should be treated equally, law and order should be maintained, justice should be ensured and legal, political, personal rights should be given i mean i believe in the fundamentals of islam and as a muslim i believe we don't need these type of movements and ideologies to identify with Allah SWT has guided us in every aspect. I can explain how Islam has raised the status of women which was not the case before Prophet Muhammad Peace be upon him and made them equal in various aspects and rulings and i can prove it see men and women both are commanded by Allah SWT to believe in Allah only and both were commanded to perform salah (Namaz) and the reward which both the genders get in the hereafter is also the same and that includes the Transgender (niether a man nor a woman) too i mean the reward the punishment and justice is equivalent for all mankind and that is the reason Islam is a peaceful religion for the whole humanity. I mean islam gives women the right to express herself and that applies for men also islam has given women the right to own property, to buy and sell, to inherit, to give charity to give gifts and these rights are there for both the genders. Also, you cannot take wealth of a woman without her consent and a woman also cannot take wealth of a man without his consent. In addition, Islam honors women as mothers too and as mothers women are treated with kindness and as mothers they are respected and obeyed greatly. Islam always educates us and the translation which i am quoting its there in the Quran too and it states that 'the heaven lies at the mother's feet' i.e. the best resort to reach paradise is through one's mother and islam forbids disobeying one's mother niether as muslims we are allowed to make our mother's angry nor we are allowed to utter even a single word of disrespect towards our parents and mother specially. Here it should be also noted that the mother's rights are more than those of a father. Islam honors women as wives and urges the husband to treat his wife in a good and a kind manner and a wife has rights over her husband and the husband too in the same manner has rights over his wife except the husband has a degree over her as a husband is responsible for the household's expenditure and is responsible for taking care of the family affairs. 

Also Islam states that the best among the muslim men is the one who treats his wife in the best possible manner and it is forbidden for a husband to acquire wife' money without her consent.

Islam honors women as daughters and encourages for good parenting and emphasises on educating the daughters and that applies for men also and Islam states that by raising her daughters in a healthy manner will ensure a great reward in the Hereafter.

Islam honors women as Sisters and Aunts

Islam enjoins us as muslims and encourages us to maintain ties of kinship and as muslims we are forbidden to severe those ties and that applies for both men and women 

Also women can run their own business if it lies within the boundaries of Halal i.e 
. Permissible and their Parda i 
.e Veil does not get impacted then women can work and have their businesses also 

So to conclude, both men and women have the right to lead a decent life without facing agression or being wronged. Also Islam ensures that justice is ensured for both men and women, both get equal rights and  law and order is also same for both men and women and spiritually also both men and women get the same reward in the hereafter. There are few exceptions for both men and women at some place women have more rights and at some place men have more rights but i feel islam guides us for a more balanced and peaceful lifestyle so as muslims we don't need these type of ideologies and movements. I agree there are those muslims also who don't practice islam and do wrong things then also we have sharia law which allows  justice for the oppressed and all the oppressors, transgressors and criminals get punished for their evil acts also if the justice is not ensured in this Duniya it will be definitely ensured in the Hereafter so i feel as muslims we don't need these type of ideologies for ourselves be it misogyny or be it feminism."

these are the videos u should make not politics
"I never understood who's arguing for what rights, Legislature of our country has clearly given same rights to each person. As a matter of fact in colleges women are given more attention in cases like career opportunities and some colleges offer 100% placement for women. I have shame on being a man."
"Once a legend say
One drunk men is equal ten phd woman 
Ek mard ka kaam aurat nhi kr skti bhai that the true"
"The problem is not feminism, the problem is what people mean by feminism. When u will asked to them who are engaged in feminists movements or who support it with knowing it's actual meaning...u will heard their absurd thoughts regarding to feminist ideology!"
"what you know about this, real struggle is done by boys in their life . All boys are facing  situation that the girls are treated good and boys are treated badly in todays day . please  see a real life struggle of boys who are facing these problem . I am also a boy and see all those thing which happen with boys now a day."
Only .01% women are tortured and others took its advantage and misuse law and order. Those tortured women can't get justice 😢
"For the first time ever Dhruv Rathee not impressive at all. Feminism is ok and must be promoted but the actual topic ""toxic feminism"" is an actual thing and you didn't even touch the topic. Show the dark side of feminism please where feminists are using it to gain undue advantages."

*Please do a PODCAST with Andrew Tate*
"Equality is always dangerous. We should strive for Equanimity/Justice. 
To all these Alpha males and Animal movie lovers - I have just 1 point. 
Imagine the movie with Ranbir Kapoor as the son of a labourer in a real world.....all your Alphas and gammas will disappear.

If you give the same normal printed books to student with normal vision and a blind student for their exams...it is equality but not justice.

We should be careful about feminism as to how its understood now. Feminism wants to bring Equality. It says that women should have ""same"" rights as men.
So if Men play 5-setter tennis matches and women play 3-setter tennis matches for the entire tournament, then how can we have equal Pay to both??
If Men in military do the heavy lifting which obviously women cannot then how can there be equal pay??
In another situation a female and male CEO should have SAME Pay as the work effort is same for both.

Vice-versa - If women take 6 months maternity leave, then should Men also take 6 months leave? No....right, because there is no justice there.

We want to force everyone to have 1 spouse, and make prostitution illegal for all - Equality. So what will happen to a 28 year old person whose spouse is long-term sick or becomes physically incapable in satisfying their partner. Also if this person is not capable of living alone...then what will happen to them??

We can take this concept further - If entry fee for good Medical colleges is 50 lac rupees for all then there is equality but how will a equally talented child of a rickshaw driver ever dream to become a doctor?? There should not be reservations but apply different fee structures based on economic background.

If we all think about JUSTICE rather than EQUALITY or FEMINISM all our world problems will be solved."

Nature made diversity and humans made   discrimination😂
"I appreciate how easily you've described this sensitive topic.  I particularly liked one key aspect of this discussion: females always receive emotional support from their male or female friends, but in the case of males, they often cannot get emotional support from their male or female friends. As a result, they are unable to share their pain, leading to feelings of loneliness, which can ultimately result in suicide."
It's important to understand the difference between believing and being toxic. I can't say this video was a justification on patriarchal toxicity because there is always a different side of a coin which is ignored for the convenience. Could have been better.

"nice video dhruv, i want to share that the points that you mentioned in the end 

no feminism showed support :- but they didnt showed protest against it. I am a proud feminist but i also think that when some girl do wrong things then the community should not sit quiet and protest against them like we do on men. thank you"

I would've loved it if u had spoken on this and given ur own take on them... I would also like to know your views on Peterson's arguments which unlike Tate, are definately much more logically corollary and comprehensive"

This was your most informative video. Appreciated your efforts. Good 👍
"Absolutely pointless waffling.
Who doesn’t know the bookish definition of feminism or the concept of equality!? 

The real world is all about snatching power from one another, feminism isn’t anything different - it is a superiority movement. In practical life, all you see is women cherry-picking the privileges they can get from both ends of the spectrum. They are weak when they want alimony, fight on the frontlines, do extremely dangerous and dirty jobs or ever take accountability for their fate. They are strong when they want more freedom to take ultra unreasonable decisions in life and there is some kind of incentive attached to it - you just cannot make it up."
"Correct me if I’m wrong here but I believe the whole ideology of feminism is just straight up bias and b.s. I know this statement is quite controversial and might hurt’s some individuals feelings but hear me out I give you the explanation. 

Let’s suppose I throw everyone on a deserted forest like we do back in era of Homosapiens and a life threatening animal pops out, it’ll be mens who jump to ensure the safety of the whole tribe, womens and childrens. So nature designed men and women to fulfill their own duties. The whole concept of feminism emerges from the modern society which just want mens to loose their natural instincts and become soft because if they do back on their natural instincts the one who are going to suffer the most are puppet masters up top on the ladder. 

And when Dhruv said “is it necessary for a female to go out make their career” my answer to this is “of course you can doesn’t mean you should” I mean only if all the mens develop some courtesy towards women rights and just provide for the family in a healthy manner then why would a woman go out to thrive and hustle. They can just take care of the wellbeing of the family and live happily, (ofc I’m not saying don’t educate yourself and don’t have any hobbies & interest and just throw your life on your someone else’s happiness). I don’t know how I express myself in least upsetting way possible because most of the Indians are quite sensitive and dramatic in taking this types of Philosophy.

p.s. - don't label be orthodox because of that deserted forest example it was just an ' imaginary way of expressing that men and women ain't the same'.

Dhruv, I’m looking forward to hear from you what your thoughts on what I just said."
"how much true is the statement "" tum mere vansh ho.. tujhme mera Khun daudta hai""....."

I agree with you in all but dhruv bhai what about the fake rape case and fake dowry  allegations and discrimination faced by men because of women empowerment. Isn't the misuse of law which is given for the goodwill of women.

"Nice video Dhruv bhai. 

I haven't come across news or a case where the feminists fight for the male victims. 

Just like the last example in your video. You said that the feminists didn't support the rich girl for her non-civil behavior. 

Then, why didn't any feminists step forward to support or help the boy. 

Just a thought for discussion. Not a debate. 

I believe there must be equality. But it seems like the wind always shifts as per time."

"I guess instead of term feminisim, we should promote term humanity. No one has misconception on the term ""Humanity""."
"In my region feminism is very misunderstood. here feminism means anti-men. here people are forced to believe that feminism is anti-Islamic which is totally wrong. in actual, feminism is against those cultures, those traditions which had made our Lifes really difficult. Women believe that men do not suffer from emotional pain, they are strong, he is considered as an iron man even when he is totally broken.
 if you have control over your women, your daughter, your sister. if you are able to force them to marry the one u want then you are a real man otherwise you are not.
sadly, we don't even have the rights which our religion has given to us."

No feminism is not destroying Indian Society. But pseudo feminism is. We cannot digress from the fact that feminism is important and avoid it being shadowed by pseudo feminism.
You are talking about equal rights. What about caste system in exam?
I also believe in equality and today I gained more knowledge about this thanks Dhruv Bro

You are soo great dhruv sir🥺...just love you❤...
Real feminism ( according to your expectations ) is not exist.
thank you @Dhruvrathee bhau for differentiating between Feminism and TOXIC feminism
What rights women do not have in today's world ?  They have all the equal rights even more than Men's.
you gave me a completely new dimension to think….thanks🫡
Thankyou ...someone explaining feminist word so positively..

"Men's suicidal rate is more, not only because of unemployment or loneliness, Its also because of emotional abuse they get from their respective partner. Fake rape cases, Dowry cases, abuse cases are prime example. Parents also getting jailed because of wrong & fake filed cases. Women's having extramarital affairs but still blaming their partner for everything, even if they are the one who is wrong. Because our society still thinks that only a man can do extramarital affairs. Alimony greed are also playing a big part. Not just that recently laws got way more baised for women's rights which is good, but many women are totally exploiting these laws according to their liking. Father's getting seperated from their kids, can't meet them for months, sometimes years. Many men are getting jailed in false cases with no proof & spending years in jail throwing their social life away for those crimes they never committed. Millions of man have marched and have been asking for "" Purush ayog "" from government & SC for proving their innocence and to tell there side of the story, but they are totally being ignored. Because of no help from our society or from our Laws, Things like these are happening in our society."

"But in patriarchy system women doesn't threaten as compare to feminist system.
You explained well feminism but patriarchy system is to protect women .  feminist doesn't demand protection   when they got effected by society lust 😂..Protest started .raise the voice women are not save ..then patriarchy system implemented and feminist people cross their limits ..
Both system against each other ..you must talk about both system negative and positive impacts on society."

"you r also part of the same group, never expected this from u dhruv. your manipulation is clearly visible. you tried hard to defend feminism despite the wrong things it did. i hope u need to watch the whole redpill documentry by cassie where she said in the end that she is no longer a feminist. you r trying to brainwash by the definition of feminism. feminism started as a noble cause but look now. the actions speak more than words. and those who r claiming about men's rights and equality tell me 
why u don't saw about less women in millitary or sewage workers.
why women don't choose men who r not up to their mark; is this not inequality
lastly why do we not have gender neutral laws, and for your knowledge it was these feminism groups that protested against gender neutral laws. good luck manipulating dhruve
i know how to treat women, she is another person with same rights, i will never ask her for something she does't like not will i force my opinions on her. for her career, i am more than happy to support at at every stage. i just want loyalty and kindness in return, something that has been ruined by feminist."

Please do some research. Don't say illogical of patriarchy women. Man women is not the same. This feminist man are forcing women to work in there pregnancy and period. Idiot fool. So called feminist non sense destroying our society.
Definitely this video change many people thought 🎉🎉🎉
When you show only one side of anything and ignore the other side that is lie.
Thanks dhruv Rathee you have just changed my view about femininsm and helped me to reshape my thoughts and you beautifully explained impact of patriachy system in men as well as. You have highlighted the issues of men and women in the society 😅

"Dhruv Rathee, Good to see your Nursery level video. You looks like best viewed Cartoon....😂"
Dhruv sir I do agree with the Most of the things you said in this video but there is a difference between Femenism And toxic femenism its same as toxic Masculinity. If you look around in today's gen the society is more of matriarchal rather than patriarchal the laws in India are baised you cannot deny it by saying women are hearing this or thus if we look at stats men comment more suicide than women even if we agree Men and Women are same and equal still men are gona criticised for not providing for their family it's just a fact and this nature as well Men and women are not Equal But Justice Should be Equal for both

"Bruh this is all very good. But today so many women put men down in the name of feminism. Companies reserve seats for female candidates during placements. Even though we have have the same education right from primary school, women are given preference. Mem discriminated women for  thousands of years. But the girls and boys born now are equal. Yet boys are being discriminated and women make me feel guilty for being born as a boy."
"Hello Dhruv sir , I love the way you explain the complicated topics easily and make them understandable for the people. I heartily appreciate your hard work. Sir , I request you to make a video on the topic "" Was Dr. B.R. Ambedkar right?,"" when he wrote the 22 vows and what were his views on equality in casteism ?  Why he used such harsh words while writing the 22 vows what was the reason ?

"I totally agree. Equal rights should be given to Women. But what about rights of men? In the Lucknow case no feminist supported the act, everyone was quiet. Isn't the moral obligation for real feminists to speak against that girl's act instead of sitting quietly? Did Dhruv Rathee even mention the case of Jasleen Kaur and Saravjeet Singh?? Jasleen is enjoying her life after putting a false rape case against Saravjeet. What about the crores of Saravjeets residing in India? Don't they have rights? If you can openly make a complete video criticizing Animal, then why not a single dedicated video on these Pseudofeministic movies? A woman who wants to live peacefully with complete freedom is a moral obligation of the society and of course every real educated man should respect this. But every woman like Jasleen Kaur who take advantage of the Women rights to exploit men should be heavily criticized by the real feminists instead of sitting quietly. Fake rape cases and fake dowry cases are unimaginably rising in India. This is a failure of our so called feminists. I hope Dhruv Rathee must have some stupid arguments to justify these things as well.

And I want to know how many girls prefer getting married to a man who earns lesser than her or who is still unemployed. In my 30 years of life I have not seen a single such case (i agree my sample space is small although). Equal rights is a mutual term. A woman should respect the rights of a man and vice versa. A man raping a woman is heinous, i totally agree. At the same time, exploiting a man by taking advantage of govt laws favorable towards women is as heinous as rape."

"Gender equality is nothing but a joke. You can't equalize them. Women have already the rights and opportunities they deserved still they ask for more. In nature, we can see that in animals, males are one to find food and shelter and females do the household works and to look after the kids, Yet in need they too need to prey."

Agar divorce over thappad hi intention tha uss gamaad director ka., he could have shown the protagonist as a habitual abuser and tapsee at one point decides not to take it any further and divorce him.

Dhruv Rathee is hypocrat . He trying to link alpha male to petriarchy like Animal but do not want to link feminism with these toxic movies
Kuch shabd English me samaj nahi aata
"Thanks dhruv bhai for valuable information

I will share your video to my wife bcuz she says feminism is not good and whereas I support to be a feminist.

"The obvious conclusion is MISINTERPRETATION. People these days tend to open their mouths on something they have minimum idea about. But the truth is that which is right should be equally right for each individual and which is wrong IS equally wrong for each and everyone, be it a man or a woman. FEMINISM CAN'T BE AN EXCUSE FOR WOMEN TO GET AWAY WITH THEIR MISCONDUCTS nor anyone should accuse someone for that."
The Lines in This Video  From  4:57 Of People Who says and Societies Who accept.Iam not agreed with these lines.Equal Right For Men=Equal Rights For Women .
"hey dhruv i watch all of your videos and i dont think i will completely agree with you on this one. in the video where you explained how movies like animal and kabir singh are promoting toxic masculinity and it is true, we must raise voice against such movies. but you ignored four more shots, considering that series like these are not made too much. yes many good feminist movies like pink are made but that doesnt mean we will stay quiet against series like four more shots...yes im a feminist myself and they definitely dont represent feminism through my lens in any way. but in a subconsious level they scream that feminism means partying and hookups, of which im totally against...for movies like these the name of feminism is getting polluted. people now think feminism is bad because of this."
90% correct 10% incorrect
"Very informative, eye-opening and educative video. Keep it up. My heartiest wishes are with you 😇"
Eske bare me apka kya ray hai sir
Excellent explanation DHRUV.....Loved it.😊
I don't know much about the word matriarchy but i read somewhere that the opposite to patriarchy is equality.
DRUV !!!!
Hats off to you dhruv. You are really a revolutionary youtuber. Thank you so much for these informative videos 👏

"Mothers are given utmost respect in the religion and the Quran commands high honour in her service. Ever since the pre-historic times, women have been of secondary importance and Quran dismisses this position. Islam in fact, was the first ever religion that tried to elevate the status of women in earlier Islamic societies"
❤❤
Can you make a video on the Electoral Bond scheme in India..Supreme Court has struck down this bond today
Why even use the word Feminism? Keep it right or wrong. And these bs movies like four more shots pls are criticised bcuz girls who don't even understand feminism will be wired around what's shown in those movies and then fight for that kind of freedom. That's the real issue.
"Saying that all humanists are feminists is an oversimplification. However, there is a strong overlap between their core values and goals, making it likely that most humanists would support feminist ideals and actions.
Equality must be established not only between men and women but also among all humans. 💞
Dhruv Bhai, many thanks for clarifying various important core concepts in a simple way with ample examples.
Salute to your perseverance and research. Keep up the good work of educating and spreading awareness.
Love you, Bro. 💖"
According to Shri Dhruv Rathee Farhan and Amir are biggest feminist... what a joke... both of keep divorcing their wife for some younger one....
"Males are physically strong.
Males are politically strong.
Males are ruling the world for thousands years.
Females should have all the benefits equal to men but you have to admit that males are physically strong, politically strong, biologically strong"
Hats off Dhruv Rathee.. You really explained each and every point very beautifully..
Why women don’t go for making buildings and to pull out oil from ocean also why not as a front line commander in the military why women want to do just comforting jobs and not physically challenging jobs I agree the faminism but then this jobs the risky once’s also must be done by women
well explained

Thank you ❤️
Unbiased and best video on feminism ♥️♥️
I like patriarchy. This video is not okay. I also support feminism. This man is a serious divider.
"Bro agar wo neha dhupia ya wo slap krne wle case me u told ki kisi feminist ne SUPPORT nai kra
But broo..
Kisi feminist ne oppose v to nai kra na

Feminism is about equal rights...
Yeha equality violat nai ho rha kya?

Nd jab koi larka kisi larki satg galat kre tab hi feminist ko equality yad ati hai
But ese cases me jha larke hi victims hoti hai yeha v equality honi honi chahiye na..

Think about it"

"That's why cheating is a boys' game

Men and women have equal rights but neither of them should take advantage and if they do they should be punished equally. PERIOD
Why can't feminism be renamed as Equalism if the whole motive is to promote equal rights? The word Feminism is itself very demeaning
The best video i ever watched about this society and a real meaning of feminism.. thank you..

Feminism has legs as long as there is Air Conditioning 😂😂😂
"Worst and worthless video ever created by you, because all your arguments were based on the book definition of feminism and u have shown women as an innocent child like creature who cannot decieve or do no bad for most part, there is already an equal opportunity for all women, and by the way like some men said thappad mein koi problem nhi hai some women also said four more shots mein sexual liberation hai its a good series, and everytime anyone has to shame men its direct but for women u people blame anything else for their fk up lol kaafi neech harkat kari h ye shallow video bina research k bna ke."
M very thankful to Babasaheb Ambedkar
"Mai jitna kahu utna kam hai........  Hence, thanks sir 😊"
It’s not that ki “kya kisi feminist ne uss problematic incidence Neha dhupia and uber fight wali girl ko support kiya?” It is that ki  “kitne feminist ne openly iska virodh kiya “?? 🤷🏻
"In between patriarchal and feminist there's another thought exist . Its says your ability equals to your responsibility. In this law a person got responsibilities by which abilities they have. And if they didn't have any kind of ability then still they can take responsibility by their own choice. but its also prohibited something for in all men or in all women or in all human .Its called sharia. and its also work in flexibility . Like in different situations its give you permission of those are prohibited to you before but only for short time,, islam doesn't support patriarchal or matriarchal. Don't think I'm here to promoting islam , we are with humanity."
"in last i want to mention, On August 23, 2015, Kaur, a former student of Delhi University posted a picture of a man and alleged that he passed obscene comments at her during an argument on road. After the post went viral, Singh was arrested a local police (Arvind kejriwal and many celebraties like parineeti chopra was in support of that girl) after 2 years of fighing case she said sorry this was a mistake and there are more case like visnu tiwari who served 30 years for a fake ra*e case and there are many more .

it is scary that a girl can ruin your whole life with a little act , indian penal court should take this thing seriously so that we can live equally."

What about caste system in education for selection in college?
"The whole world is matriarchy, all of us only designed to get stronger next generation ( and it is our hidden Moto, we may not know it consciously) you can have research beyond the video, male looks physically strong, in some species ( eg. Peacock) more colourful, only to attract female to mate, to ensure stronger ,more potent next generation"

"1. You talked about Hindus and Left in the matter of patriarchy, and you carefully ignored the most patriarchal society. Why so scared 😂😂😂
2. Do you think men have more rights than women ??? Which are those ??
3. Why feminist people don't ask reservation in jobs like Sewage work, Electricity work, and many more works like these, why only ask reservation in parliament???? What kind of equality is this ???
****I also advocate for equality, but complete equality!"

"Sir 6 month pahele daal dete iss topic pe video, mere previous semester main aaya tha yea topic"
"Feminism itself means Gender Equality in terms of Rights. Problem lies in the different different IQ levels of different different people so that they never understand what the actual meaning of feminism means. They often confuse the word 'Feminism' with 'Toxic Feminism' which can also be called as Matriarchy.

Current Situation of Indian Society is that we are still fighting against our Patriarchal society for a Neutral Society but there is a problem. Low IQ People whether Girls or Boys, have made a bypass bridge towards Matriarchal Society, due to which fake cases, promiscuity, extramarital affairs, and other things in girls is seen. This is going to make Indian Society worse than ever. Our Whole Constitution is Feminist as well as Anti-Men.

I would like you to make a video on this topic also."
So the whole conclusion is that it’s verse of what we say women should be equal in every aspect. Nope a men should get equal right in emotional terms.
Indian women themselves are most patriarchal...there actions and words never match.... But they want selective changes according to convenience...
2 comment Kiya maine aur last me yahi bolunga ki tum ladkiyo ko dosh de hi nhi sakte...kyoki tumhari biwi tumhe chor degi...
Isko jarur kisi ladki ne riswat di hogi
One of the best video...👍
"Yes. I am a Feminist. I believe man and woman must have equal rights. Though in the beginning of my life i believe woman do not have the ability to as man. Then I saw a hindu girl. She is really special, who changed my thinking. I respect every woman and I believe the are equally talented as man. 

I am from Bangladesh."
Kya ho gya bhai bhabhi se ladai ho gya kya
"What about biasness in the job sector , I've seen it panel is always happy with the girl even they're not smart enough still."
Ladkiya bohot bolti hai ki tum ye nhi Kar sakte to tum mard nhi ho..lekin jab unhe bolo to bura lag jata hai
Very well said... I wish more people understood feminism in the right way so the society would change...
Please make a video on kejriwal 💀💀
I feel very happy to hear about savitribai phule from you. It's very sad to see that nobody talks about her outside Maharashtra. 😢😢😢😢

"hame mard ban na padta he
Ladkiyo ko kabir Singh hi pasand he
Tuj me rab dikhta he vala sahrukh nai.

Ladka ladki ke bich ka relation vo relation he jis me lakde ko ek pyar ke badle apni atma bech de ni padti he and selfish female use bhi noch noch kar khati he
And sabko dikh bhi Raha he
But tumare jese log hi indirectly propoganda felate hi ki vo male ko noch rahi he it's her choice"
Bhai tumne ladkiyo ko sirf victim dekhaya aur sari galti ladki ki...aur jaha ladkiyo ki galti hai waha tumne sidha sidha society ko dosh de Diya...manta hu society ladkiyo ko bohot dabati hai lekin Kya society Jo advantage deti hai sirf aur sirf isliye kyoki tum ladki ho...aur society ladko ko bohot advantage deti hai lekin disadvantage vi to bohot deti hai..mujhe problem ye hai ki jab ladki ko koi problem ho to ladko ko dosh dete hai lekin jab ladko ko problem ho to ladkiyo ko kuch nhi kaha jata
"I don't know how can I thank you for making video on the very topic, and trying to help the youth of our country, the youth of our country are not familiar with the actual meaning of feminism , the consider feminism with metriachy 😢😢."

Hii
Hats off to you ✨💫

Dhruv is pushing an entire generation in the right direction 🤌🤌👏👏👏👏🤔

Bhaiya aap Omniverse ke concept ko explain kardo
Main Ek Muslim hun aur Islam bhi yahi kahta Hai aurat mard barabar hain Lekin agar aurat kam karne ja rahi hai kahin per bhi to usko parde Mein rahakar kam karna chahie aur Islam jis Tarah bolata hai auraton Aur mardon Ko kam karne ko is Tarah karna chahie Islam ke right ke hisab se
An influencer in true sense ❤
I appreciate with you😊😊
Men are strong💪
Great work man👏👏 keep it up..
But what feminist do is to target and abuse men....you are video is fully one sided...
"Thank u  so much sir , this was much needed !"
Problems is that patriarchal mindset also blame education for making mans stupid..! As man are born as ignorant by them..!🤔😕
"Dhruv sir , law ka bhi baat karo . Ladki ko saza kyo nhi milta ?? On false cases , gender neutral law for domestic violence, harrasment, outraging modesty of men also. Same punishment for false r@pe cases , false harrasment, domestic violence case , business in name of alimony. Courts granting custody of child to women by default without analysing relationship of child with both parents. Allowing alimony to wife inspite of cheating."
salute bro
Ham ek dusre ko tasalli Dene ke liye dono ko barabar keh sakte hai lekin haqiqat ye hai ke aadmi aur aurat me fark hai....baat Kam ya zyada ki nahi hai.. fark bahot hai
"I'll add one more thing , pseudo feminism DO exist. These people CLAIM that they are feminist but in reality they are matriarchal....so people get confused about the idea of feminism. So, pseudo feminist DO exists"

"When you can use lines from 'Upanishads ' why not from 'Quran'?  I don't mean to make it a religious thing. But when u include Religion, u shd include all religions r8?? and  entire content is childish. When u talk about work, physical means not according to body parts my dear. It's about physical strength. Few works involves Heavy physical strength nd danger. why not feminist demand equal job in those works also? You talk like in every rescue operation they say ""ladies n children first"" that means they are patriarchal?  Feminism is necessary but to what extent? that's the limit FEW feminists need to know."
"Most men ( who can think ) are okay with the idea of feminism but do not want to call themself feminist, because of the word feminine being present. I think it stems from deep rooted toxic masculinity where anything feminine being related to men is considered to be shameful or disrespectful. For example.. Ye kya ladkiyo jaise ro rha hai, ye kya ladkiyo jaise baal lambe kiye hai, chudiya peheni hai kya humne, etc."
People forget the difference between feminism and matriarchy!

Congratulations Bhaiya."
Bhai ab aise bande ke khilaf koi kaise ja sakta hai mai toh yeh sochta hu 😢
"What's about difference  mental capability of both gender, that's make the main difference. These pseudo feminist never tells this thing publicly  .  At first my question what is basis of asking equal right . Gender equality just only a fancy term , And whole does not run on fancy terms , Gender equality fundamentally imposible ."
In this video you are wrong @dhruvrathee
❤❤❤❤
"Yes Dhruv you aare absolutely right Hinduism is very bad religion as it says that for a woman her husband is her god.... Which is absolutely wrong husband is a demon isn't it..... Happiness of family doesn't matter.... Means you should give immense pain to them....... Woman should listen to her father or husband? Nah its silly to listen to them just disobey them..... And the concept of aradhangani ...its a fantasy only isn't it...? 
But look at Islam its so good it says that women is your kheti.... So nice and one can marry his or her own brother, sister, niece, uncle etc. So open minded society it is.... Having 4 wives is cool.... And yes what about 3 talaq and halala system..... 
Gender inequality exists only in Hinduism not in any other religion so use the example of it in every feminism video..... 
Good job 👍"
12:14 this is not patriarchal mindset. This is women's mindset of attraction.
I have mad respect for u bro ❤️❤️  thank you for portraying feminism correctly ❤❤
It is not  feminism or masculinity is about being good human to the society
"The problem is simple, most people don't know the meaning of feminism. I have seen so many men and women who call themselves 'feminist' but their whole definition of Feminism revolves around Matriarchy. These people are matriarchs in the garb of feminists, either intentionally or by mistake."
Dhruv bhai ki knowledge 😮😮😮
This is masterpiece!! It was one of your best videos.

I don't agree with dhruv about this video. Man and women are never equal but both are equally important for society. And women will never be good politicians because naturally women are easy to manipulate 🙌🙌
"Aaj maine real feminists ko samjha 
Thank you sir 
We need a lots of People like you ❤"
"This video has covered ""feminism"" in it's entirety..and each word spoken has made the the difference b/w patriarchy and feminism very clear and easy to understand for the audience 👏👏"
good topic as always👍👍
That is u called knowledge brother ❤🎉
Bro you rocked 😆😊
Feminist is Randybazi
Ek hi dil kitni bar jitoge rathee ji❤
This video is fully one sided similar to how radical Faminism works today
"Truly Dhruv you are just superbly right. 
Aapne meri dil ki baat iss video ke through puri duniya ko bataye thank you... iss cheez ko zyada karke 5 logo mein bata pati.. sab ko aise khulke describe nhi kar pati ..... Thank you is cheez ke video banane ke liye...

"What about, Maharashtra me ladkiyo ko free education hai aur ladko ko nahi! Ab kaha gaye equal rights?"
Bacha hone k bad aapki b soch badal jayngi....aurto k bare me😂😂😂😂😂
ladkiyan nhi ladke khul ke baat karte hain. i don’t agree with this point. ladkiyon ki dosti acchi nhi hoti. infact ladkiyon ke bhi jyada tar acche dost ladke hi hote hain. aur ye ekdo nhi balki numerous examples dekhe hain maine
Thank you Dhruv for come up with this needed video. We the viewers are grateful to you. 👌🏻🙌🏻
Was waiting for this video for a very long time😅
Best one
Thankyou dhruv for making this video.
But excess of anything is bad.. for any Gender
You are basically indoctrinating your foolish western ideologies that have already failed in western countries and now people are leaning towards traditional values for e.g. look at the birth rate in Italy this is the result of your so called feminism ideology
you copied this content from Nikita Thakur😂😂😂😂😂
"Modi ji gave reservation to women in parliament so he is also a feminist.
Jai Hind Jai Bharat 🇮🇳💯🔥"
Why society wants male to cry 🤷🏻‍♂️
"When male cries for the first time he becomes man,crying is not wrong but making it habit for letting your emotions flow through it is girls thing,even in today's time most of the women don't cry for silly things so dont be loser,want to cry,cry but don't let what led you for that crying again...."
Amazing Video ❤
This video is gonna change the perspective of so many people! Finally someone explained the difference between feminism and matriarchy......this was so much needed... Thank you for this one!!
Dono ka kaamana jarruri hai aaj kal ni toh gareeb reh jaaoge jamana badal raha mehngai badal rahi.
"Great video Dhruv 👍 
There is a lot of confusion around feminism. 
This video is successful in easily explaining the real meaning with real examples."

Bhai kisan andolan topic pr video banaiye jo aajkal protest chal rha hai
"All those Neha Dhupia memes and series like Four More shots really left me thinking of what I am following is really a right belief or not as I truly believe that most men are really a victim of patriarchal belief. But This Man *Dhruv* really gave me an assurance that feminism isn't against Men in any way , also not all men are disgusting and not all women are great. We still have some really amazing men like him."
Should women be drafted for war like men ?
"We believe in Equity not in Equality... In some aspects womens have advantage and in some other aspects men have advantage
..."
We have to basically differentiate between feminism toxic feminism and toxic masculinity
One of the best vidio on feminism..❤❤
Thank u for this amazing video
i love this guy
Difference between literate and illiterate.. First take the proper knowledge before talking about a matter.. ❤
"Constitution right and laws must and should be gender neutral, the law is highly against of men in every possible way, even it is proven now, there are majority cases found where laws are misused for their personal benefits, there is no deny that real victims are suffering."
Girls/woman earning more than man even getting paid leaves more than man.. I know many firends earning 12-25 lakh pa in IT/Finance/Consultancies/Investment banker. Even they are getting female quotas  and extra marks in CAT

"But government Women ko extra rights de raha hai uska keya ex- pink bus women train scotty, scholarship only for woman, 1000-5000 pocket money only for woman uska keya bhai... In WB class 10th k final exam main is sal 1.25 lac kam boys the girls ke comparison main but sex ratio to wo nahe hai itne sare ladke kaha gayab hogaya???"
Ek baar 2 beheno ne 3 ladko ko bus me belt se pita tha... Tab pura India unko heroine banaya tha... Baad me pata chala wo ladkiya hi galat thi... Ispe kya kehna h Dhruv??
Blud just made a video for old generation
"If Puran says that husband is the god of wife then they alos say that wife is his aradhangani means half soul..... 
You used many examples from Hinduism to tell how women are treated unequally ( which is absolutely ridiculous becz you yourself had not read the scriptures and have no particular refrences) but what about Islam where women is called a Kheti of man and Halala system and Tripal talaq anx many more...... It's not religion Feminism is a concept of political scuence and as a political science student I want to say that explain it politically rather than connecting it with only one religion or community."
Mai class 10th 2023 24 batch ka student hon... I'm also like dhruv brother video❤❤
3:57 iin dogle chinduo ko har kisi baat se loose motions lag jaate hai 😂😂😂😂
I understand feminism  very nice ❤
At 12:15 i want to say they are the traits of attraction i.e. biological attraction
"Can you tell me where is the equality in women being sentenced less than men for the same crime? 

Can you tell me where is the equality in indian laws and how many ""feminists"" opposed women centric laws or even talked
about male abuse, domestic violence again men? 

Can you tell me how many feminists are fighting for men's rights??

This video is the classic example of how someone can be very distant from the ground reality and using ostrich approach, would just bury his head in the dictionary definition of words...people don't talk about 1800 or 1900's feminism because they were not alive back then...

How many feminists are protesting against women's reservation? Equals don't need discriminatory privileges 

This is just like islam apologists, whenever you highlight their flaws..they come back at you saying this is not islam..."
"God these ideologies about feminism one must read Mary Wollstonecraft,  Gayatri Spivak,  Simon de Beauvoir..before making a speech about feminism  🙏🏻"

Thank you so much sir
Finally t shirt colour change 🤣
"This video whole point is: Woman's are right and man's are wrong.
What is equality as u Said being similar is enough for equal rights than According to science chimpanzee are similar to human then we should give them jobs.
When you're hiring a chimpanzee as your video editor.😂"
Promotion of Mirzapur 😂
kitna propaganda failaoge yrrrr
Want a video on radiation exposure of smart phone .
"Logical video.. agreed with your whole narration completely... BUT at that point where you have said, has any feminist supported that girl involved in lucknow incident? Answer is NO.. but I think femisist should also come forward to criticize these type of incidents, so that people know what is real feminism and what is not... I think just keeping quiet is not the solution.. it is spreading the wrong message to the masses..."
yeh pagal hogya hai 🤣
"I am not favouring any sides, but nowadays i think females have became superior to males. Lets take an example, i saw a lady in a market buying some things anc a male was standing besides her. He was watching his mobile phone or something. But the lady suddenly slapped him without the reason and said him that he touched her. She even said that she will accuse him for sexual harassment... Its not fair. Now if we swithched the genders then what would that man would do... I think this is the harsh reality nowadays..😅😅"
Wow. Rightly said
"This video properly explsins the term feminism
I have no wors of appreciation ..like its just wow🎉
The points i had in my mind but i didn't had words to explain."
Bhai sach baat to ye hai ki tumhari wife tumko manti ni hai kyo ki o forener hai to ye baat bol ke aapne dil ko sukoon de rhe ho😅
Bhai pure video me tune 98% aadmi ki burayi ki hai sirf 2% achi baate ki hai....baat feminism ki kr rha hai to km se km apni video me to equality maintain kr le aadmi aur aurato k bich me.....yaa fir tu ye batana chahta hai ki aadmi kitna bura hota hai....
Reality 🙌

"I believe the social media has done us dirty but thankyou Dhruv for clearing the misunderstanding between Feminism, Matriarchy and Patriarchy."
I strongly disagree with you..... and I think Patriarical thinkng is better then femenist thinking
Amazing dhruv. I really appreciate that you chose this topic. Thank you for being a humanist and feminist.🙏🏻
Bollywood has become pseudo feminist now a days a female can hit a male but male can’t 🤷🏻‍♂️
Man and women are equal but not same  !!
Dhruv sir you are the best 💜
Finally Dhruv's video on this topic😊
Bhai Sandeep ready ki dono movie ko patriarchal kese kh skte ho yar kuch bhi bolega kya agar bhagwan ne muh diya h to
Making video with one and two examples and the problem of society is completely different. Watch this video as fun.
Feminist ne support nai dikhaya theke lekin uske against me bhi kuch nai bola 🙅
Quality content
Greatfull ❤❤
Sandeep wanga reddy 😂😂😂 crying in the corner...
Respect
bro you are paradoixcal at one end you promote movies like Gangs of wasseypur and call that a cult classic(which also had gore and patriarchal elements) and at the other end you call animal movie a cancer your viewpoint should be the same irrespective of brand partnership.
"Huge Respect For You 🙌🙌🙌
Thank You Dhruv 🙏
Society needs more ppl like you .."
Tea and coffee pr video banaiye
Bhai feminist pe tu video bnyega socha nahi tha
Beautifully explained. You have my Respect.
Respect for him👏👏
"Videos Thumbnail :- Toxic feminism

Video topic :- real feminism and smart integration of toxic feminism with 
patriarchy.

Video problem :- pointing out ""alpha the males"" but not pointing out ""pseudo feminist influencers"" who says men are dog

Yes there are some self claimed feminists who thinks four more shots was real feminism

logical Solution :-
 using more gender neutral term instead of things like patriarchy which often describes only evil men and feminist which depicts only strong and bold females.

Rather use and create more gender neutral terms.

About hypocrisy :- well everyone is a hypocrite unless you are a god or something. I have heard many feminists saying BE A MAN."
If your wife sleep with another man will you give this advice to your wife's lover ?
I have question which rights have women don't have and  men has?
I want to give an awesome suggestion of an marathi series DIL DOSTI DUNIYADARI... is series me mumbai me kaise ladke ladki dost eksath rehte haii.. and isi orthodox patriarchal vicharokobhi khtam karte haii...
Very true
"Theek hai i agree with femism and support it. Lekin mujhe nahi lagta women and men are equal and same aur kyu equal hona, konsa men itne achhe h, kyu na women ko apne hi cheej me men se achha ho. Men women ko ange na badhne de ye bilkul galat hai. Par women ho ya men dono ko apni limit pata honi chahiye"
"As always well articulated and to the point , amazing….heads off to this man and his team ….keep the good work up….❤❤❤❤"
"Khubbb judge kar rahi thi thumbnail ko dekh kar. Ki ""kya pata kya keh dega!"" 
Bohot badhe influencer ho tum.  Ku6 ulta sidha keh doge to bohot asar padh sakta hain. 

Magar u r always on the right way...❤ thnku❤"
Thats how real feminism should be!
Be alpha bro
Black man and white man comparison is so dumb. They work enough and together. Woman should get similar rights not equal rights
"You are a great youtuber and nice person there is no doubt at all and I love all of your videos. Their is one what I don't like is that you define some people as ""chappari"" like they done type of bad sin. If they are chappari that is not their  fault it's society , teacher , parents, environment , and most of all social media . We don't even know who we really are, we are just the product of our environment. It's  my opinion to view the world. So, don't judge me like I am I patriarchy guy ya femenist. I just saw the world as one. At the last, I want to thank you for providing these types of content ..."

Thanks for change my thoughts 🤝♥️
"if you ask people if they are against women empowerment they will say naah we support it
but if you ask are you a feminist they would be like yuck no
only the term feminism is spoiled
just like KTM is a good bike but it is called Chapri Bike because chapri boys destroyed it's reputation the misandrists also ruined the term feminism by calling themselves feminists"
That's why i only belief in Dhruv
Thanks Dhruv bhai doubt clearly ke liye I am also feminism 🙂
But bro didn't talk about toxic feminist which is showing in Bollywood
Feminism is for weak pussies
"Interview by Neena gupta has been interpreted wrong, you all must watch the full podcast."
"thankyou for guiding me , i have experienced this in my own home but i promise my upcoming generation and me will never do it 
thankyou for confirming that if i am a feminist its not to be ashamed of ❤️"
Is video se simp ka smell aa rha hai bahut baar
we should be permote feminism because all human beings are equal.
U missed Dr ambedkar who has given rights to Indian women
"1st video where not agreeing 100% only 50%
Coz nowadays women not wants equality they want superiority.
They need both abla naari and women empowerment at the same time."
Thank you Dhruv Rathe for educating. Your videos have always given me a different perception of looking and treating people equally.
THANKS A LOT
Right
"Dhruv i admire you so much ❤i can't even express
Its like you are giving words to my thoughts and articulating it to audience in amazing way"
Perfect😊
""" I measure the progress of a community by the degree of progress which women have achieved  . """
this video is really good.
Rightly explained.

Agree just how female deserves right animals also deserve rights
Kise lagta  hai rathee sir politics join kr le toh desh ko sudhar denga❤❤

23:28 kaha tha bro Taapsee pannu ne khud kaha tha
I love your video ❤
Bahut achha😊
Quality at its best !❤
13:14 He called samajhdaar aadmi why not samajhdaar aurat ?? he's not a feminist too !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is your worst video by far .U missed many points that should have been showed u mostly criticized the patriarchy but u must have equally criticized matriarchy.Improve your videos or just don't make it
Femanist girls se zada problematic femanist or simp boys hai ...
एक काला आदमी और एक गोरा आदमी बराबर क्यों नहीं है एक अपाहिज और एक पूरा यह बराबर नहीं है समझ में आता है। एक पढ़ा लिखा और एक अनपढ़ बराबर नहीं है यह भी समझ में आता है और एक काला आदमी और गोरा आदमी आपकी हिसाब से बराबर नहीं है ऐसी क्या वजह है आप मुझे बता दीजिए। और आप जैसे लोगों का ज्ञान हमें दिख जाता है कि आप लोग कैसे हैं और क्या बताना चाह
A well researched and thoughtful video👏
Great job dhruv … you explained each and every details so well.
There is none that I have seen who plugs a sponsor so seamlessly in their videos 😂.
Great Dhruv bhai❤
Chhapri gang 😂😂😂😂
"Great video Dhruv. Please try to not use the word Chapri. I see many people use the word these days, even the ones we consider the same, use that word for others. I feel it's quite a classist word and people should stop spreading it."
"I love you, Dhruv rathee sir.. thank you so much,  I truly appreciate this video.."

"Alpha man isn't anti feminist 
In simple words alpha man is= a responsible respectable man."
Kafi achhi video he lekin mera ek sawal he puri video me sirf baat patriarchy buri he ho feminisam sahi he is par baat huyi jo ki sahi he lekin matriarchy ke bare me kya us par kon bolega isse to sirf sikke ka ek pehlu hi pata chalta he or ye video or jankari adhuri lagti he
"I'm feminist but after marriage in educated family also its hard to handle the drama and fights on quality and feminist specially when you live with in laws. You are working and still have to look into all home chores and house work.  eventually you start becoming or start accepting patriarchal thought just to ignore fight with husband or in-law as we live in India to avoid divorce many working women who were feminist before marriage and changed after marriage just to avoid fight, drama and divorce.  
 Before marriage, Educated people (In laws) talk about quality when you are working and and after marriage at home start there behaviour and thoughts same as patriarchal thought.  
When will society get change and accept real meaning of feminist"
"OMG ! Ye hui na baat, very good I am so proud of this man... 🙏🙏🎉❤❤😊"
Ham ladke rulate nhi.

"I respect dhruv a lot and am on the same page as him most of the time. But I differ with him on this topic of feminism. Modern feminism goes in line with atheism. Any religious person will oppose feminism, as it challenges the God given responsibilities to a male and a female."
Jay Jyotiba Jay Savitri Phule ❤❤❤
I don't know why many people criticise Dhruv .By knowledge perspective l like him and it will be youth changing moments for our country😊😊😊😊
i'm glad you made this video and educate some people's what does mean by feminist thank you for that😊

Mera comment mai kud like karti ho😢
"Bangok Jake aye ho kya... Wo reel vala gana "" SAME SAME BUT DIFFERENT.... "" sun ke equal rights ka logic de rahe ho...

Homo sapian species me toh 🐒 monkey's (Ek ka naam Dhruv Rathee hai) bhi hota hai, Jo ki  90% DNA humans se match hota hai....

Toh kya unko bhi equal rights milane chahiye.... 

You are equating mens colour difference with inequality of men and women..  wow...


Difference Anotomy me hai hi hai.... Aur wohi sabse bada fark hai...

Jo tu sirf ek do genital ka fark hai bol Raha hai.....

Wohi fark se hi.... Production System chal Rahi hai....

The psychological thought process of men and women is also different....

There is an EQ and IQ level difference also there....


Kya ullu bana rahe ho..."
dhruv rathee jese well educated admi ko India ke prime minister hona chahiye ❤
Patriarchy supporter🖐️
They want everything equal but when it comes to equal work they don't
Next video you must cover future of gaming in india ❤
Very well put and said.. feminism very well and correctly explained🎉 Thank you for this lovely video

"You missed that nowadays girls also don't know real meaning of feminism and follows toxic feminism. 
It is more important to make girls aware about real feminism than boys otherwise I will always be like two divided teams 
And i belive girls and boys are not same and they should not do same works but i also believe whatever they do they should get equal respect a girl cooking food should be treated equal as boy doing job. 
I don't understand why we are trying to remove gender identity instead of that we should remove gender inequality"

Sare exampal hinduo ko dikhakar kiya hai. Jabki ye sabsi badi samsya aaj bhi muslio me hai. Inhe dar lagata hai sahi exampal dene me ya inke view kam hone ka dar rahata hai.

Yar ye YouTube ek hi like button ku deta he 👍👍
"Why do you always say ""instagram ke chapri ladke"", why not ""instagram ke chapri ladke ladkiya"" ?

I suppose there are many instances in the video where you could have said this but still you choose to say ""chapri"" only to boys, why tho?

Btw, I'm not against the video in any way, 100% agree with your points but still i think you could have ignored that partiality."
Dhruv Rathhe : Real Sigma 🗿(Who talk about Equality)
Main part from 20min 😂😂😂
"Dhruv bhai i really like to watch your video 
But in this video 
U give a example of a lucknow women hitting a guy .....
U told no feminist women support this .
But if same as been done by a man then action have been taken against men then 
Have any action has been taken against women ?????
Pls explain"
"I agree the term ""feminism"" has lost it's actual meaning because these chapri people associated it with female version of patriarchy."
Bro woke up nd decided to speak truth
this topic is very situational and debatable..  There is no one answer to this..
What about Muslim girls 😂😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂
"Sre bhai wo sab to theek hai lekin movie dekhkar koi criminal kese ban sakta hai ye bata do, mene to bohot si Gore movies dekhi hai bohot si normal movies dekhi hai, mujhe animal bhi pasand aayi or 12th fail bhi same bahadur bhi pasand aayi or gangs of wasseypur bhi 😗, dikkat kisi ko nahi hai, bas jo animal farm waali video me tha ki esi movie dekhne waale ese ho jaate hai, esa kuchh nahi hai movies ko movie tak hi rehne do😅"
❤
love the way how you use ai
Finally someone saying the truth. Nothing more beautiful then a feminist men.
"Bhaii but aapko baat us topic m krna chahiye tha ki kuch log feminism k sahare men ko dabate h ... 
Jese law female ka jada support krta h , rape ka case lgate hi ldka pahle jail jata h phir salo tk case chlta h . 
Men jo suffer krte h us bare m v baat kro bhaii .."

THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOY AND MAN.
"Waah be Rathi. Again you succeeded in dancing around the subject without actually addressing the topic, and trying to come off as an intellectually superior show-off. 

You used a click bait thumbnail about toxic feminism, and yet spent the entire video justifying the existence of actual real feminism. 

Sabse bada chhapri tu hai"
Just normal whitewashing of feminists and their hunger for control on everything that they want. Read Indian laws and false cases data that had lead to suicide to some men. As a men such ignorance is pathetic. Atleast be aware about your own harassment .
Best explanation 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Koi logic hay iss vedio ka.
Modern Feminism isn't about equal rights anymore. It's about man hating now
I want Gender Equality Laws in India.

Bro is helping class 10 students in revision of ssc topics.... 😅😅this topic is from class 10 political science chapter gender religion and caste 😅btw thanks for this amazing video ❤
I think most of the people who are against feminism is due lack of understanding of this subject as well as the word feminism contains fem that I think makes people think that it is female oriented so I think feminism is right but the word feminism should be altered
Tum mard nahi ho
Ye video har school me specially among young students dikhayi jaani chahiye
i completely agree but you didn't mention that actual real feminists who knows what feminism is are very rare....most of the girls/womens nowadays who call themselves feminists are just matriarchies...
17:56 Savitri Bai phule along with his husband opened the first girl's school in India
Many things are mentioned in this video but the book The Second Sex is not mentioned here Simone de Beauvoir was a writer whose rebellion was related to feminism.
He is a knife which is coated with poison 😅😅😅.

"Moral policing krne ki adat lag chuki hai bhai ko
'Animal' movie to khud hi bta di thi k the guy is already not a good human being....aur badme ek incident k bad hi becomes animalistic!
pr fir bhi kuch bhi basss bol do
kya feminists ne kuch bola ""four more shots please"" is movie k support me
to usse movie ki watching kam hogayi??? no. of chhapri ladkiya jo usse affect hoti wo kam hogayi???
feminism k filhal k reality hi ye hai....k the majority part of it on social media is toxic 
koi actually achhe feminism programmes aur novels/ videos ki reach
Aur toxic feminism vale opinions k reach me fark janlo 
to ye ankh pe chadhi patti utar jayegi
feminism word no more means only equality....somehow it's just being mysandrist nowadays
statements like ""world doesn't need men"" are just irrational when its built with their sweat
now agar mai ye kehke credit du to iss fact pe bhi logo ko objection hoga k ladkiyo ko kam ni krne diya isliye
agar dete bhi to nai krti....and that's normal...generally males bodies are built to be stronger naturally
and that was Neena Gupta's point k men and women don't need to be equal
pr bhai ko moral policing k aad me kuch bhi criticize krna hai basss
there are things men and women can do equally....and there are things that they are individually better at
Men and Women both need each other...to live in this world <3"
Itna hi feminism h to Alimony aur maintenance mt lo fir
All have equal rights....at the end but now the days female are getting to much power than mens...It is not right👎....and the females in India are getting out of hands....I request to all the females that respect to all others...❤
"Hey Dhruv I understand your points on feminism and all the points in the video are great but you still did not address the fact that 
1. There is no provision in our constitution which allows a man to file for a divorce in case his wife is involved with another man and not pay alimony
2. A woman can file a fake case of rape on you and police will lock you up without any evidence
3. If the case is found to be false, the woman will not bear the consequences 
In these cases, a man's life is ruined until he proves his innocence but the woman can walk freely how with equal rights"
1 no.explanation❤
Thanks  sir but you missed a great Feminist  name -Dr. Br ambedkar❤

Bhai jo kaam men karte hain woh kaam women nahni kar sakti bhai ehi truth hai. Aur sabkuchh women rights men keliye toh rights hi nahni hai. Example:- Electric Pool pe chadke kaaam ladki nahni kar sakti ek men hi kar sakta hai esa kaam.

"i really hate those people who will exploit the original religious texts(especially the Hindu texts) to represent their statements as correct and like it's acc. to the religion like WTF it's not even a thing there(people who know get it and ones, don't hurt everybody) and they start manipulating people thru it . being feminist I want the equality in everything for everybody seriously it's like the common sense. People can even oppose this really is scary and shame to modern society, feel like old problems never got solved."

"I want say one thing, that feminism is good if u take it in actual way like seetal devi, kalpana chawla, N. Sitaraman etc , but if taking the word feminism and doing everything that shows a picture that u r doing equivalent work as male although u don't do is not acceptable and also using those feminism laws to ruin boys life also not acceptable, wearing short dresses, revealing sexual body parts won't make u independent woman, so thing is this feminism is acting as a support to do all wrong things. The day when both males & females will worth value of people's mindset then it will be a  real mindset and a woman should always take care of their baby although she is a working woman, then we will support that it's actually a feminism movement.. Thank you"

"Pehele mereko lagta tha ki Feminist is a word for just females, but from inside I always think for equal rights for a male and a female.
Yes, I a Feminist!❤
Not just for females to get equal rights as men, but also for male's to save themselves from rubbish Patriarchy."
Feminism is not a problem but modern feminism is a cancer. Modern feminists are just plain and simple man hating society.

"Your video always has clear answer to the topic but why in this video you're so confused, in this episode all sections and topics are repeated in other topics of this video, may be this is scripting problem or you don't want to give clear indication on what you're saying, what you're standing for, or what you wanted to convey, by far this is one of my least liked video by you Dhruv, i enjoyed watching your videos but this is very poor writing and scripting of the video, you introduced and explained the word ""matriarchy"" but not used single time, saying toxic feminism promoting patriarchy, masculinity, why are you afraid or hesitant to use the word matriarchy?"
Aapke contant me vo dum nahi raha

"Toxic feminism ke naam pe 20 min to patriarchy pe nikal di, akhiri m 4 min toxic feminism ke baare m baat kari to aise show kara ki sirf 2, 4 % ladkiya aisi hi, but the reality is ki 90% ladkiya matriachy ko feminism samjhti h, drinking, smoking, cheating is cool aur bill split karne ke naam pe patriarchy ki supporter ban jati h, ek anti dhruv rathi channel start karna padega"

"I am not here to insult any religion, nor do these comments mean that you should misunderstand it, if you don't agree with it, ignore it.
  While people's thoughts are being discussed, I would also like to share with you some things that a man told us, Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) told us what are the basic rights of a woman, and when people abuse their daughters.  When they were born, they were buried alive and felt ashamed, so Hazrat Muhammad (pbuh) explained what the position of a woman is, and how holy Allah has made a woman, and what a woman does in a society.  What are the rights of a father, of a son, of a brother, of a husband.
If we examine these things carefully, the world will become a paradise and there will never be any debate between men and women.
  Thanks"
Literally goosebumps what are you making sir hats of to you
❤
"Y itni gehraai se samjhata h n, ki Marianna trench bhi chhota lge😂"
Totally agree with each point of yours Mr Dhruv. What is right for men should be equally right for women and vice versa.
I wish that your efforts for making this video on feminism topic will be an eye opener for the soo-called patriarchal people . Thanks for making this video

"I think women are the one who bear children
So when it's time to bear and nurture children women should take break from career because naturally fathers can't do what mothers can
So here mother is superior than father when it comes to take care of children and hence to create stronger human being which again in turn will contribute to the stronger community
So we can't say that even if in pregnancy ot post pregnancy women should be paid equally in jobs
Similarly when men are jobless and women are earning because of anything causing disability for a man to earn it's fine...that time women can support and otherwise men are superior....so it's simple
They are not equal at all stages of life 
Somewhere women are stronger and somewhere men are stronger
Equality doesn't mean every stage similarities"
"First, we are human beings and each of us has an equal right to have access to each field and to gain knowledge and manage the field for the betterment of our mother earth through the exploration of talent that each of us has. It’s about the revolution on the conservative cultural practice through the proper co-operation and co-ordination between men and women with awareness, instead of hiding the talent and emotion within us due the pressure of fake cultural practices."

"Bro lives in his own “perfect” world, everything he said sounds good but isn’t practical. If someone hits you, you should remember what Gautam Buddha said and keep quiet. That’s not how the world works dude"
The real thing is feminism Is good but today's women's Thinking is going on toxic feminity
"Bro ask a feminist if she want to marry an unemployed man. Go and check the real society. 
Imagine Karo druv ka wife Kal use cheat kare and they got divorce. What will happen?
She will get 50% of his property. And monthly alimony aside.
I am saying just one case.
1st wave was good,
2nd wave was good,
Now it's just a joke..
Let me tell you one thing there is no rights for men.
And Druv if you got time than answer how should we understand this things?
By definition or by practice?"
ध्रुव भाई आपकी इस मेहनत को दिल से सलाम ❤️🙏🇮🇳
Phyllis Schafly was a hero. She fought to save the lives of many women who were murdered in the wombs of their mothers. Men and women have equal dignity but we play different roles. The hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world.
"Feminists dont say they are against men ... Their actions they are against men ... I don't need to tell which speaks louder than the other
I would love it if feminists did what they claim to do!!
Just like feminists ask for menstrual leaves, do they ever take into account that it will force companies to further exploit male workers in a country where the workforce is paid less than 50% of the value the worker adds to the company?
Have feminists ever demanded laws asking for better working conditions for men since more than 90% of the workplace deaths are men?
Have feminists have ever influenced the government to take steps towards education of boys as 85% of India's child labour force are them?
Have feminists have ever asked for housing facilities for men since 92% of the homeless people are men?
Since circumcision is clearly a human rights violation, have feminists ever demanded the WHO/UN to stop it rather promote it as a HIV/AIDS prevention?
Here is a cool story-:
In the third wave we see feminists significantly advocate for gay rights. Do you know that male-male contact is 81% of the time responsible for STD's? So after feminists advocated for these and the cases of HIV/AIDS increase, WHO, UNAIDS started special movement to circumcise baby boys citing that it reduces HIV transmission by 60-70% in male-female interactions also citing that circumcision causes childhood trauma, infections and even leads death of individuals. The self acclaimed feminist organisation openly allowed the murder of men to avoid STDs for women. Also Operah Winfrey, another feminist who openly use the foreskin for women's beauty products.
Now tell me feminists aim for equality. Hypocrite Liars"
well when you say that women should be paid equally i agree then the womens should also start to take up hard labour intensive jobs as the man.Then we can say that women and men are really equal
I recommend you to study Professor Ann Oakley of Genders studies.
"8:47 is very related

"Societal norms often restrict Males from expressing playful nature due to gender stereotypes, but why? Breaking these norms is essential for creating an inclusive society where individual can be true to themselves without facing judgement based on gander .Accepting gender-related variations, such as body and behavioral differences, is important, acknowledging that individual preferences ultimately vary 🌸✌🏻"
"I have no words for this video

Yes we want everyone equal!! But can you make a video on how women use there laws against men!! You don’t marry an Indian woman that’s why you don’t know what’s actual problem

Dhruv bahi... Agr ye log Females ko males ke barabar mante hai... Woh bolte hai mard karrahe hai woh hame bhi krna chahiye.... Lekin isme males ki kya galti hai... Afemales ko toh qudrat or God ne hi males se kam tkuwat de hai... Isme me difference ki koi bhi baat nhi... Ye toh nature ne hi khud auratu ko mardu se kamzoor banaya....

In war conditions why 18+ men are not allowed to leave the country and women are allowed . Equality means men and women both should fight for their country

Although im not big fan of dhruv. But i completely agree with dhruv after this video.
Maine pura video dekha hai dhruv bhai. But aaj kal men’s right bhi bade ajib ajib ban rahe india me ek video uspe bhi bnao. Bohot sarw log shadi nahi karna chah rahe kyunki divorce me unki property adhi ho jaati hai zindagi bhar ka khrcha uthana padta hai wife ko like christiano ronaldo ne bhi nahi kiya hai

Great Sir 🎉🎉🎉❤🎉best topic cover
He gave perfect definition of feminism....Every men and women should see this and know what actually feminism  is ..... ❤.....
Amber heard is example of feminist also 😂😂😂😂
Smash patriharchey
Your videos leave a great impact on my life!🙏
Yes!! Animal movie is Cancer

Exactly 💯
"@dhruvrathee You and your team are good in education and analysis. But, my suggestion is for you, kindly read and understand QURAN MAJID seriously and sincerely about this topic."
Bro you have explained this concept so well ❤ Thank you for such videos and topics which is very helpful in our lives 💯🙌 We need this kind of issues to be raise in our society...
Thanks from all woman's ❤️❤️❤️❤️
😢
one of the best video of dhruv bhai
"Dhruv sir your videos are awesome but I have noticed that you use the word ""Chapri"". I politely suggest you not to use the word or you will catch a controversy.
By the way, can you make a video on "" What is Gen:Z"" Or something like this?"
"Yes everything is cleared !! That nomatter what the issue is you'll never miss a chance to defame hindu culture and rituals.... Why don't you use other communities example's for oppressing women's or it just in Hindu 's culture you find thers issues, it's not about the right or wrong....the feminism part was in point but it's just your one side and soft influencing showing all the problems in one community...."
"Dhruv, you have my respect ❤"
Aiims mein Faminism rule 80 :20 reservation in nurses vacancy is the zender discrimination rule
"You are such a 😂😂
Pran jaaye but agenda na jaaye"
🎉🎉🎉❤
I also believe men and women shouldn't have equal rights. To be honest rights are earned imo regardless of the gender.
"Dhruv , I believe right for equity not equality for women.  Because it's obvious that they have huge difference not only physically but psychologically"
Bro u r very opposite about men’s loneliness
"All these European mentality entering India is ruining our teens and youths and giving half knowledge, Indian Society was great in ancient times because we never talked about feminism and all because rights were always equal for both genders and no one even thought of feminism or smash patriarchy

Every right is same for both men and women by default and we at least shouldn't fight aur debate for all these rights... It's just wasting of precious time of life

These thoughts from the west are destroying mindset of girls and boys and their relationship is getting worse..

Great respect for this video, And Also you uploaded it on a perfect date ❤👍"
Thank you for this amazing video ❤️✨

Thank you rathi to explain feminism
16:00 riyal
This is all about social conditioning unfortunately.. brainwashing itna zyada hai k mahilayen aware nahi hai apne rights k baren mein.. lot of women are confused regarding feminism.. gender is politocal and sex is natural and that ks where the confusion lies.. very true that men are also becoming victims of patriarchy
"To us Humans, we can never differentiate between what is Pure Good and what is Pure Evil.
Synthesis solves Thesis and Antithesis but after some time the Synthesis itself becomes Thesis or Antithesis and the cycle goes on and on.
Humans can't understand what is Pure Good and Evil.
That is why we need The Creator Himself to tell us what is Right and Wrong.
Read Quran my friends it has all the answers to the problems of Humanity."
"अबे पुरुष प्रधान से nature है। ये आप हर प्रजाति मे देख सकते है केवल मानव नही। तो व्यवस्था भी उसी हिसाब से होनी चाहिए। ये सोच नही बल्कि सामान्य बात है जो सही भी है। तो जब पुरुष प्रधान nature ही है तो समाज भी है और होना भी चाहिये। इसलिये आज तक सामजिक व्यवस्था अनवरत चली आ रही है। तो आज के time जबर्दस्ती का फेमिनिस्म वाला नाटक करने की क्या ज़रूरत है?फेमिनिस्म nature के विरुद्ध सोच है जो सब कुछ व्यवस्थाये बर्बाद कर देगी। इसलिये ये गन्दी सोच है और यही मूर्खतापूर्ण सोच भी है। क्योकि इसका कोई आधार नही। nature के विरुद्ध जो गया वो खत्म ही हुआ है।
और ये बताओ कौन से अधिकारो की बात कर रहे हो? समाज मे महिला पुरुष के अधिकार और कर्तवय शुरु से समान थे। लेकिन इनका अलग अलग समायोजन था जो की इनके अलग अलग स्वभाव के अनुसार था। इसलिये सब कुछ विधिवत  व्यवस्थित था और परिवार सुख पूर्वक चला करते थे। अगर मर्द बाहर का काम सम्हालत था और औरत घर का तो इसमे असमानता नही बल्कि व्यवस्था थी जो इनके स्वभाव के अनुरुप थी जो अपने आप मे वैज्ञानिक थी। तभी तो परिवार चला करते थे ना। काटे की टक्कर सिर्फ आपसी बैर लाती है प्रेम नही। लेकिन इस अहं बात को आज की पीढ़ी भुल गयी। तो इतनी सुन्दर स्वचालित व्यवस्था मे जबर्दस्ती कमी नासझ लोगो द्वारा निकाली गयी। क्योकि आज के पढे लिखे किन्तु दर्शन से नासमझ लोग महिला पुरुष की प्रवत्ति से अनभिज्ञ रहने के कारण  परिवार व्यव्स्था के तर्क को समझ ना सके और मूर्खो की तरह समानता का नाटक खड़ा कर दिया।   और देश की महिलाओ की दुष्प्रवत्ती को जागृत कर उन्हे मोहरा बनाकर हिन्दू परिवार व्यव्स्था को बर्बाद करना शुरु किया।

खैर चलो अगर समानता लानी ही थी तो ढंग से समानता लाओ ना। महिलाओ के लेकर फेमिनिस्ट लोग दोगलापन क्यो करते है। जहा अधिकारो की बात आये वहा समानता समानता चिल्लाने लगते है पर जहा बात कर्तव्यो और समान सजा व कानून की आये तो फेमिनिस्ट ध्रुव राठी जैसे नपुंसक दोगले रोना धोना शुरु कर देते है। ये तो कोई बात नही हुई।
मै चाहता हूं की सारे कानून लैंगिक समान कर दो ना एक बार अपने आप दूध का दूध और पानी का पानी हो जाएगा। सबको वास्तविकता का ज्ञान हो जाएगा और तब भार्तीय परिवार व्यव्स्था के पीछे छिपा गहरा कारण भी समझ आयेग, तर्क भी समझ आयेगा और उसकी अहमियत भी।
क्योकि स्त्री पुरुष कभी समान नही हो सकते। ना शरीर से, ना बल से, ना ही स्वभाव से। इसलिये जबरन समानता का नाटक सिर्फ बेवकूफी की सिवा कुछ नही। नारी का स्वभाब चंचल और मर्द का स्थायित्व, दोनो मे बहुत बडी भिन्नता है। एसे मे दोनो को समान अधिकार देना गजब बेवकूफी है।
परिवार खत्म नही होंगे तो क्या होगा।"

"Bhai problem feminism me nhi , problem hai ladkiyon ke apne rights ka galat fayda uthane se hai, jo aaj ke date me bahot jyada badh gyi hai"
"The difference which happened over ages amongst genders is primarily due to differences in emotional quotient which develop due to the female hormones, majority males cannot be as tender and affectionate as females, both have different level of tolerance thus the difference in the responsibilities, still it’s a must that females and males should get equal opportunities in everything, but can’t have similar expectations, one will score over another depending upon the task, due to a primary natural selection"

It is not true....only a part of the story. Unfortunately so called feminists never raise voice against male oppression. Everyone is talking about women employment....but how many raise voice that a employed woman should take an unemployed man ....

"Video Title Should be - What is feminism and how come ""only"" Hinduism and VHP oppose it?"
I am so proudfull that my thoughts are as similar as dhruv rathee 💀
"Koi bhi kamati Hui ladki ek berozgar se shadi kr le wo rarest of the rare hai.

Koi ladka Jo ladki ke rights ko support krta hai wo bolta hai ki ladki ko equal sab kuch milna chahiye wahi koi ladki uss ladke ke bare me nhe bolti ki bhaut kuch hai jo ye akele sah raha hai chalo isko support krte.

Feminism word use karke isko sab issue bana Diya bas ek aacha insaan bano wahi kafi hai chahe wo aurat ya aadmi, sab badhiya hi rhega"
"I always think dhruv is right in almost every topic but sometimes I feel he hides some other important facts in the video of that topic to give a feeling that he is actually right but like in this video he specify that argument between that boy and that girl but he didn't specify, what happens to that boy later😢😢"
My colleague also once said ki Mai chahti hu ki Mera husband mere se zada earn Kare nahi toh husband kis kaam ka
"Wow! That's so great I got to watch this 🥺 Because I was so overwhelmed or I felt like I was wrong for being feminist bcoz people around me never understand the view of equal rights since when it comes from a girl related to rights or freedom people start to think that they are asking power or lower the opposite gender and look upon as we are the toxic females and just not only that what makes it more worse that even females don't understand this, I have never met any male who thinks feminist should be there and also very few female who says feminist is what we need , I have seen many females who thinks patriarchy should be there females should not ask for their rights this makes more sickening coz I feel that I am the wrong person who thinks about equal rights.I just hope people understand that no matter what gender is we all are human in the end and we should stand for eachother !!! ✨"
"Really ❤❤❤I love this man,please make video on girls act in Indian constitution, and positive and negative things ❤❤please"
"Dear Dhruv Rathee, You are a very intellectual person I respect you.
But You calling Salman Rushdie legendary it's an insult to an actual legend authors and hurting so many Muslims sentiments who want to bring him into justice for writing the satanic verses
If he he had wrote the satanic verses about ram or any other religious beliefs god I guess your thoughts would be different about him
He's a piece of sh*t and a coward who is hiding
No offence to any Hindu or anyone else but we will never forget traitor such as salman rushdie"

Isliye Amir khan shadi  pe shadi karta hai
My comment will be lost somewhere in this section but there is a section of women who mistake feminism as something that all men are their enemies and the only way they achieve feminism is by fighting against them rather than with them which affects alot of good men who mean no harm. 24:56
dhruv neet jee mains mai cast system ko lekr vedio bnao
I am not a fascist or any other political ideologists but why dhruv is only talking about patriarchy in vedic dharma or the hindu community where as islam is the most patriarchal reigion  why are you doing this type of bigotry always
Ek video male ke upar bhi banao😢
"Feminism in its roots is great, equality amongst men and women is what should be the main goal and there should be conversations and how to exactly accomplish those things, while having an understanding of each other. However, I feel modern day feminism has been perverted into instead of having equality, they rather have superiority and completely voids out any other male or dissenting opinion and conversation that they deem as “misogynistic”. People rather scream at each other than actually talk and think things through logically."
Best explanation of feminism ❤…like the way you say CHAPRI GANG 😂

"poor = chapri
rich = Idol

patriarchy nhe honi katam kabhi bhi.

1 war honi hai sab famous terminology katam hojani hai, larwa lena phir apas mei Aurtoon ko.

Aurat soft hai, unko unkay kaam karnay do. 

Aur zabardasti ka Pseudo Feminism apnay pass rakho ap 

Mostly ghar mei daddi, maa, biwi ki baat suni jati hai, aur bahir k kaam mard karta hai.
Aur agar mard poora nhe kar pata tou biwi, bhen, beti uski support karti hai, uskay sath kaam mei ya phir koi aur business/job kar k.

Don't make it complicated."
You talk about garud Puran but you forget Quran why did you not talk about Quran
This is equal for both male female 😊😊😊
Hardly anybody would be against equal pay provided the output also has to be equal. What feminism is doing is it's just matching equal pay without the output. Eg Women cricket player should not be paid equal as more than 90% of the revenue is brought in by the men. And people saying that women's cricket didn't get time to evolve can wait a 100 years and see the situation not changing much
"I agree with woman’s education..financial payouts..equality at work..all of that should take place..
But what I don’t agree with is that woman should not make political decisions..they should look after the children because they are physically made for it..if they choose to have children..
Because woman are going to brighten the future of earth for a better world..
It’s a kind of an argument that hard to win.."

 when this secular , liberal cults will get this, I don't know. they used women as product and then they said it's women empowerment. a women who works as air hostes provide services for passengers give them food, take care of them then   you guys mention him as independent women. the same women who cooks for his family , took care of them  then in your liberal eyes she is opressed by the society , by the men😂. you guys are the most hypocrite walking on this planet.👎👎"

Hi Dhruv sir Goshare aap jo unlimeted pese deta hai is par ek video bana do yhh aap real hai yaa fake 🫵🏻
"Very informative, loved the video❤"
Very factual &Nutral
"Mera manna hai Party mein ek thappad wife ko agar husband marde uske wajah se divorce Nehi hona chahiye aur to aur wife bhi agar ek thappad marde party mein toh bhi divorce Nehi hona chahiye.

Jisne galti ki hai usko agar baad mein galti ka ehsaas ho jaye to divorce ki jarurat Nehi jai. Ek thappad ke wajah se divorce thoda jyada ho jayega.

Lekin agar galti karne Wale ko galti ka ehsaas bilkul Nehi hai to wo bhi patriarchy ya toxic feminism ki shikar hai.

Us case mein divorce ho sakta hai.
Your views plz..."

"Feminism, patriarchy, animal rights...these things are so selective. Each one of us use these terms only as per our ease. Barack Obama in his tenure bombed several countries where numerous innocent women were killed and numerous had their lives changed. Women rights to door ki baat hai, these women didn't have basic human rights let alone women rights. How can they or anyone call them Feminist? 
Look at the situation in Palestine today, thousands of women are living in dire situations, they are being oppressed by men of the opressing nation. No one speaks of women rights for them, They are not treated even like a human. These fancy words are just for internet."

Good Work Dhruv, nice Video but needed more research. Last but not the Least Feminism doesn't mean Hating Men or Surpressing Men.

"भाई मुझे तो समझ मे ही नही आता कि लड़कियाँ किस Equal Right की बात कर रही है, देखो equal right देने मे कोई बुराई नही है पर लड़कियाँ Equal right लेना ही नही चाहती, जैसे मानलो एक लड़की कि शादी है और उसके छोटे भाई ने उस शादी मे बहुत मदद कराई अब जब उस लड़की के भाई कि शादी हो तो उस लड़की को भी उसकी शादी मे उसी तरह मदद करनी चाहिए पर वो नही कराएगी और ये लड़कियाँ बोलती है कि इन्हे Equal Right चाहिए और इन लड़कीओ का क्या है इनके ऊपर कमाने कि ज़िम्मेदारी थोड़ी है अगर एक लड़का ना कमाए तो कोई लड़की उससे शादी नही करेंगी पर लड़किओं का क्या है उन्हें बस एक अमीर लड़का देख कर उससे शादी ही तो करनी है और ये सब बकवास बात है equal right और वैसे भी उसको लड़की होना का फायदा मिल ही रहा है एक गलती करने पर हमारा बाप हमें कितना बुरा मारता है पर कोई भी बाप कभी भी अपनी बेटी को उतना बुरा नही मरेगा और लड़कियाँ कहती है कि इन्हे equal right चाहिए"

Dhruv you need to understand the problem is not feminism its toxic feminism. Women in today's date are well educated and are dependent enough to be on their feet but that doesn't mean they do not need a man. A man need a women and a women needs a man. Right now women need equal pay in the fields that does not generate the same amount of money for women as they make for men. Honestly now its reversed now women wants to feel superior that's the problem. In my opinion both men and women have their own sets of tasks and they should do it irrespective of their pride.

Why do girls marry only government boys? Equality was said at that time.
Thank you for educating and spreading awareness ❤
Why don't girls go to any force? This is equality for all girls.
What about Indian laws
"So call feminist also problem of Real feminizam , no doubt women have right to wear anythink but somewhere there is thought that small and tight cloths are the only right if any girl like to wear sadi kurti then she is BEHENJI and backword mindset.
When the time to learn feminizam everyone backstage but time to teach everyone is come infront of to teach.
Sir you talking about The great savitri bai phule she fight for girl education but now in same city pune girls want equality in wrong thinks done by mens like drinking smoking. Is this savitribai want ? Is this feminizam?"
"Problem is not with feminism. Problem starts when women and men starts using feminism as an excuse to be unruly and then show that as an example to be followed. Like examples of women(feminists) who sell their bodies and then use feminism to promote the same among other young women. Similarly with multiple sxual partners both for men and women.

 I think patriarchy is still needed in a lot of aspects, for example, a child needs his/her father while growing up. A mother cannot fullfill the requirements of a father and it's a fact."

"औषधि, हथियार और महिलाएं

 ये तीन चीजें पूंजीवादी व्यवस्था द्वारा पूरी तरह समर्थित, समर्थित और संरक्षित हैं।
 जिस दवा को बनाने में शायद चार रुपये भी नहीं लगते, वह गरीबों को सैकड़ों रुपये में मिल जाती है।  यकीन न हो तो पाकिस्तान, भारत, यूरोप और अमेरिका में उसी दवा की कीमत देख लीजिए.
 हथियारों का निर्माण और बिक्री भी उनका एक बहुत ही महत्वपूर्ण व्यवसाय है और जिनके पास यह व्यवसाय है वे दुनिया में शांति क्यों चाहेंगे।  इसलिए हम देख रहे हैं कि देशों को एक-दूसरे के खिलाफ खड़ा किया जा रहा है, देशों को एक-दूसरे के खिलाफ खड़ा किया जा रहा है, और घातक हथियार ऐसे ही नहीं, बल्कि मानव बस्तियों पर परीक्षण के बाद बेचे जा रहे हैं।

 यही हाल महिलाओं का भी है.  सच तो यह है कि दुनिया के तटों पर बसे सभी शहर सिर्फ सेक्स के धंधे पर चल रहे हैं।  चाहे वह होटल हो या कैफे, बार हो या नाइट क्लब, मसाज सेंटर हो या पार्लर हाउस, टूर इंडस्ट्री हो या सफारी।  स्त्री को छोड़कर सभी नीरस और नीरस हैं।  इसलिए गरीब और जरूरतमंद देशों में रहने वाली हवा की बेबस और लाचार बेटियों को बहकाया, बरगलाया या फिर मजबूर किया जा रहा है।  ये आग उगली जा रही है.  यह उद्योग क्यों चाहेगा कि महिला पर्दा करे, घर पर रहे या कम से कम मिश्रित समारोहों से दूर रहे, आधुनिक उदारवादी बाजार महिलाओं का सबसे बड़ा व्यापारी है।  इस बाजार में हर दिन और हर महिला के शरीर की बोली लगती है।  और इस महिला के इस्तेमाल से नए ग्राहक इस बाजार की ओर आकर्षित होते हैं।  बुनियादी अधिकार और आजादी के नाम पर महिलाओं को सब्जबाग दिखाया जाता है और उसे बाजार में उत्पाद के रूप में बेचने की तैयारी की जाती है।महिलाओं की नग्नता इस व्यवसाय में केंद्रीय भूमिका निभाती है।  इसके लिए सामाजिक स्तर पर विभिन्न अभियान चलाए जाते हैं और पारंपरिक महिलाओं की नग्नता को सुनिश्चित करने के लिए राज्य स्तर पर सुधार शुरू किए जाते हैं।  पाठ्यक्रम पढ़ाना उनका मुख्य लक्ष्य है।  फिलहाल नाटकों, फिल्मों और मीडिया के स्तर पर इस पर मंथन चल रहा है, ताकि इस नग्नता को सामान्य बनाया जा सके.  यह व्यवसाय पूर्व और पश्चिम में बिना किसी भेदभाव के चल रहा है, हालाँकि पश्चिम में यह विकसित रूप में विद्यमान है और अब पूर्व में स्थिर होने का प्रयास कर रहा है।"

"I am a Feminist and I support equal rights for Muslim women. Muslim women are not allowed to study in my area. I'm sad that WOKES like Dhruv Rathee talk about Sati System (Which is abolished) in Hindu Society but never talk about rights of Muslim Women. Some Muslim women don't want to wear Burqa but they are forced to wear, They are not allowed inside Mosque, they are not allowed to opt for higher studies and these So called WOKES dont talk about it. Hypocrite Dhruv Rathee"

RATAN TATA IS A PURE ALPHA MAN..
you are right about feminism but the truth is many women who call them selves feminist don't fight  for those rights. if they want equal tights i don't or most men don't have a problem with that but the media only shoes us how feminist people want to wear clothes like boys or walk on the street without a shirt which is not acceptable in all societies. so people now have a mindset that feminism means girls doing bad things. i am a muslim but i am not telling you to not go to school or do a job but i am telling you to wear decent clothes which cover your body i am telling you tot not wear clothes that will attract boys towards you. i am a boy so i know what a bow will think about some one wearing those kind of clothes. again all boys aren't like that a half or 75% of them are. in most religions they show women as a sign of respect and beauty. the people who think islam doesnt alow women rights that is compleatly wrong because islam says what ever you do wear decent clothes(islam tels you to wear hijab or burkha but every one has there belifes) the people who promote that women need to be in there houses and dont need to studdy they are just pro muslims or any pro religious people. you will never here that a muslim women who wears a burkha got raped here i am not saying that if you are not muslim and dod not wear a burkha you will get raped the point i am trying to make is people who are willing to rape people are not getting attracted by women who are wearing burkha because it hides their body shape. if women wear decent enough clothes which cover their bodies than peoples minds will change and they will also support feminism. also we see in movies that a girl is drinking or smokig and they shoe those seans as feminist. but the people who associate feminism whith doing what ever a boy does will always be bs people. men and omen are two different genders they have different roles in society like men are stronger than women there is no denying that ia the same way women are better at arts  and crafts so if a women were to participate in a lifting comp with boys they will never win. just like boys will never win in arts and crafts. some people will bring out an arguement that bes painters or artists were men but we have to think that women did not have rights do improve their skills. also most big artists were feminists. so my point is women should fight for the rights they really need they should not fight for a right which they can't do good use of. this video was very informative and realistic so thank you Dhruv Rathee a lot of love for you.
On point ✅
Because chapri are immature 😂😂😂

ध्रुव राठी वैसे तो मैं तुम्हारी बहुत सी वीडियो देखता हूं प्रशंसा करता हूं जब तुम सुभाष चंद्र बोस पर कोई वीडियो बनाकर किसी क्रांति करो बहुत अच्छी वीडियो बनाते लेकिन तुमने यह वीडियो बनाई सबसे बेकार वीडियो बनाया भाई याद वीडियो है इसमें तुमने लड़कियों की तरफ डरी कि है और तुम लोगों ने बोला है की लड़कियों के लिए लड़कियों के लिए अधिकार की बात करते आमिर खान तुम और भी बहुत साड़ी जिनके नाम लिए तो सब को लड़कियों की सेक्स मिल जाता है लड़कियों से सबको लड़कियां फ्री किस देती है लड़की अमीर खान की 3 शादी हो गई है फिर भी लड़कियों से गले लगाती है लिपट जाती है कई जगह पर आमिर खान को कभी अंकल नहीं बोलता इतना बड़ा हो चुका है ना भाई बोलती है तुम्हें भी लड़कियां अंकल भाई नहीं बोलती हुई लड़कियां तुमसे अभी भी लड़की हाथ में आती होगी लेकिन जिनका नहीं मिलती उनसे पूछो मुझे नहीं मिली मैं लड़कियों के अधिकार की बात कर ही नहीं सकता मैं लड़कियों को कितने अधिकार की बात बोलता था की लड़कियों की लड़कियों की कल होना चाहिए हर चीज में एक समान होना चाहिए क्योंकि मेल फीमेल की नजर से निकाल कर ह्यूमन के नजर से देखना चाहिए इंसान की नजर से जैसे आचार्य प्रशांत बात करते लेकिन अब मुझे नफरत होने लगी लड़की है मेरे लिए 40 साल का हो चुका हूं लेकिन मुझे गर्लफ्रेंड ना दोस्त ना बीवी तो बीवी तो मिला ही नहीं क्योंकि मैं एक आईएस 15000 कमाने वाला इंसान हूं वह भी मैं हाथ ठेला पर फ्री करके सामान भेजता हूं कॉलोनी देश में स्टेटस के अनुसार लड़कियों और भी नहीं मिलती खास तौर पर बड़ी समाज में क्योंकि छोटी समाज में लड़कियां कम पढ़ी लिखी होती है मां बाप जबरदस्ती शादी कर दे दे अहिरवार वगैरा या धनक समाज में कोई भी नीचे कास्ट में लेकिन यहां पर तो लड़कियां खुश हो जाती है फेमिनिस्ट के नाम पर सोच विचार के नाम पर उनके मां बाप तो हम जैसे लोगों की शादी करती ही नहीं होना गर्लफ्रेंड मिलती है लड़कियां गर्लफ्रेंड भी उसी की बनती है लड़का स्मार्टनेस होता है पैसे वाला बाइक पर उल्टी सीधी बाइक चलाता हो सके उनके साथ छेड़खानी करता हूं या गुंडागर्दी करो मैंने देखा अच्छे अच्छे चुटकुले लड़कों की लड़कियां फ्रेंड गर्लफ्रेंड बन जाती है अब आमिर खान में कौन सी अच्छी है सलमान खान में कौन सी अच्छी है सलमान खान की लड़कियां मिल नहीं सिर्फ पैसे के दम पर दिग्विजय सिंह ने तीसरी शादी कर ली है इस उम्र में संजय डेट ने दूसरी शादी की है अभी आशीष विद्यार्थी ने 61 साल की उम्र में 35 साल की लड़की से शादी की है सिर्फ पैसे के दम पर हेलो कौन से शादी है मैं नैतिकता में अच्छा हूं कि मैं प्रकृति के लिए भी सोचता हूं मैं एक मच्छर मारने से पहले सोचता हूं मैं जिओ पर तैयार करता हूं मैं ना कोई ड्रिंक करना गुटका कुछ नहीं करता मैं हर चीज का व्रत करने सट्टे का विरोध करता हूं दुआ है तो उनका विरोध भी करता हूं मैं हर एक बुराई के खिलाफ हूं मैं हरदेव जंगल को सपोर्ट कर रहा हूं मैं किसानों के लिए समर्थन में खड़ा हूं मैं हर जगह न्याय के लिए खड़ा हूं लेकिन मुझे फिर भी कोई लड़की ने समझ पाए ना समझ पाते हैं इसलिए मुझे लड़कियों से नफरत है मुझे तो बीवी तो ठीक है एक सहपाठी भी नहीं मिलती है जीवन परिचय जो मुझे दोस्त बना कर रखा है कि मुझे फोन पर बात कर सके ऐसा मैंने कल की यह मेरी गर्लफ्रेंड बन सके कोई तुम लोग हग डे बनाते हो गलती गले लगने से मन को सुकून मिलता है तो मुझे तो आज तक कोई भी लड़की ने गाली नहीं लगाया कोई भी फीमेल नहीं मिली जो मुझे गले लगाए तो मैं कैसी लड़कियों पर विश्वास नहीं लड़कियां ऐसे छोड़कर लोगों से लगे आमिर खान को तो कितनी लड़कियां मिलती है अभी कमेंट में कई लड़कियों होगी जो तुम्हें अंकल या भाई नहीं बोलती होगी ना आमिर खान को ना विराट कोहली गुना रोहित शर्मा को नंगा कपिल देव को नहीं सचिन तेंदुलकर को सचिन की मोदी भी हो गई होगी तो उसकी उम्र की लड़कियां सचिन को गले लगा के लेकर जाएंगे अब राहुल गांधी से कितनी लड़कियां गाली लग रही है वह राहुल गांधी को कहां कहां पर हाथ पैर देते हैं यहां पर वहां टच हो जाते लड़कियों को थोड़ा सा का टैक्सी में बैठने पर तो लड़कियां मुंह बनाने लगती है बस में लड़कियां अंकल बोलने लगती है राहुल गांधी की लड़की अंकल क्यों नहीं बोलते भैया क्यों नहीं बोलता लड़कियों के लिए ब्रश सीधा जवाब में कपिल शर्मा शो में लड़कियों की हकीकत खुल जाती है वहां पर जाती है कपिल भाई कपिल कपिल कपिल कपिल कपिल कपिल शर्मा की कॉमेडी कोई भी सेलिब्रिटी जाता है उसे बोलना चाहिए लड़कियों को कि मैं आप अंकल बहुत पसंद करता आपकी फिल्म अधिक ही है अगर लड़कियों को राहुल

"Don't Judge Humankind by it's cover!   Humans should strive to live together in harmony, embracing diversity, empathy, and mutual respect. By fostering a culture of understanding and cooperation, we can create communities where everyone's rights and dignity are upheld. Communication, compassion, and collaboration should be the pillars of our interactions, leading to a world where kindness prevails, conflicts are resolved peacefully, and each individual can flourish in a supportive environment."
The world now is no way patriarchial...it's quite balanced but those uneducated feminists disrupt the attitude of good people...if we are equal to women...why don't we have equal laws and regulations...the uneducated feminists who don't know the real meaning of feminists want to make the society matriarchial they believe they do not want any men in the society...and a lot many things...but the thing is that we all want the world to be equal to all of us ...the grass should be equally green on both the sides...I am a feminist...but an educated one...I want the world to be equal for all sections of the society ❤

Your thinking is next level
No 2 persons whether male or female aren't equal
"""Either you are feminist or stupid""- This is the whole essence of your video. Perhaps a hurried, oversimplified and potentially inaccurate assumption. Equality and respect for human not any ""ideology""."
"Dear Dhruva Rathee, I want to bring your notice (or already you know) that a new type of mindset prevailed amongst male nowadays. They don't feel ashamed of having a less paid job  than a wife  or not having a job. Instead they are happy to get married to the girl with a salary or a high salary or richer. But one thing is unchanged that this type of man wants that things should go in or outside of the house according to their wishes only. This is the worst phase of a woman's condition. whomever one should bring up with humanity."

i don't agree
"The problem is that when people like you, sucharita and all pseudo feminist rant for straight 15-20 min in their videos tweet against such films( Kabir Singh ) or acts. But when acts that doesn't support their narrative like you have shown four more shots or the incident where the girl was slapping the auto driver, they don't even acknowledge such incidents and even if they do they don't rant. Jokingly saying ha buri film thi ya ye thodi hota he feminist ye kehke nikal jate hein. Where is your rant your tweets your 15-20 min videos about this incidents."
The wife who breaks the house due to the influence of outsiders is called a feminist.
"Your maturity shines brightly in every videos you uploaded guiding us with wisdom beyond years. It's not just in the words you choose, but in the silence between them, where your understanding and patience resonate the most. Thank you for being a beacon of calm in the storm, showing us the strength in reflection and the power of thoughtful action. Your videos is a reminder that true maturity is a blend of listening, understanding, and acting with intention. We are all better for having witnessed it."

So much deep discussion.....
Thank you for this great information sir actually most of boys were misguided in such a way but yeah now we are in a right track
"Just because he spits statistics and quotes research papers and facts.... doesn't make him right 
The narrative he puts out is extraordinarily skewed 😂
He touched upon a lot of topics with a distorted approach .... This demonstrates his limited understanding of the said topics... Topics are presented with preconceived notions and does not resonate well with ground reality....
😂 It's safe to guess that this was targeted towards specific audience whilst catering to a specific other...
All in all too many topics touched superficially and with a very lop-sided take on them..."
While listening to your videos I feel like pressing the like icon a thousand times Dhruv
Informative video 👍
Sab kuch sunn ne ke liye achha lagta he but reality kuch aur hota he ..😂😂 Amir Khan ki example ea khud to divorce diya he 😅 Dhruv bhai apka daughter night 8pm tak ghar na aya to aap bhi khud call karoge 😂 kesa equality hua 😂😂
"I have been watching you since 2018. And i am 20 y.o. dhruv sir, i have to say this i have mad respect for you. And f those people who criticize you. You have an educated audience and i am proud to be one of em. 🫶"
the root cause for the arise of feminism is the basic rights which are being denied ...like right to education..right to work...and right to choice to spends their own life...even ryt to property....many asian girls do lack these ....and then on the same page due to society these bad laws like alimoney after divorce etc have been there...support equal ryts for girls and get rid of bad laws which are burden for men....i would say a true feminist wont even like to accept anything which demeans her value....nature has built man and women a bit different to sustain ecosystem and not to demean one against another...its the society which suppresses women in the name of nature...any enlightened men or women or a  thoughtful person can never imagine suppression of ryts in name of gender
Ur good teacher for the society  to walk in good path to new generation to change

"This is the most comprehensive video that I have come across. I want the entire world to listen to every single word that he said here and contemplate on them.
Be aware of what's right and what's wrong and casual."
"Had you discussed about the so called 'Non Feminist' movies before reviewing 'Animal'???
So please stop fabricating the things now.
Watch a movie only for entertainment... Don't stretch your mind"
Somehow you managed to blame men. Great.
16:16 Isi kaaran 99.9% gents alcohol/cigarette/tobacco consumption ka bhi shikaar ho chuke hai. Most men consider these types of unhealthy activities as stressbuster/a way to open up & express ur feelings
Mai fir kehta hu ko women ho ya men sabko equal opportunity do lekin overpowered to mat Karo kisi ko bhi.

"Ah, a very controversial topic cuz ismein logon ke uppar atti bandhi hai ke dusri side ki sunna gi nahi hai. I won't lie, mein bhi waisa hi tha but I do watch your videos with an open mind toh kaafi cheezon mein I was like, nahi this makes sense I was wrong. 

Now kuch cheezein hai jaise you said patriarchy ka meaning and you mentioned ke going against patriarchy isn't male bashing, but the point is ke us word ko maana wahi jaata hai, kuch gine chune human rights activists hain jo jaante hain but majority audience thinks ke patriarchy ke against jaana means you don't want men despite that fact ke even of they're capable. 

Another point is ke now I like the fact that you've touched upon mens lonliness but I wish you spoke on the unjust right that women have against men. Like if she files a complaint of harrassment or ra*e, then man will be immediately arrested without evidence or search, many women use this as a weapon against men to blackmail them, me being a victim. The fact that women marry men, file a divorce with false allegations leaving the guy in spot where he must pay a lumpsum of his income monthly or face jail time. 

Now my point here is, of course I want laws against ra*e ofcourse I want laws against abuse in a marriage and such serious issues, but I don't want it to be this absurd where women use these rights as a weapon. 

My personal view is that tier 1 cities know the rights women have and there women and men live equally, have equal incomes, I feel feminism was made to uplift the women who are deprived off their rights. Those are the families in the lower class section in our societies, the tier 2 city tier 3 city families where the old mindset still functions. But I feel in this movement whole there are few that focus on them, we've lost the meaning of feminism as privileged women use it as an excuse for their Inabilities. Where they have all rights but since they are incapable of doing something the blame it ke they don't have rights. 

As a guy I am uncomfortable getting in a relationship or talking to other women now cuz I've seen my girlfriend abuse her rights against me, due to that I might not even end up marrying anyone and just die a loner cuz I don't a bad women in my life as it'll have repercussions on my families safety."
"Why are women asking for equal rights to men ? Why don't they ask for their own rights ? Like why they don't demand higher salary rather than demanding equal salary to men ?
Female models are paid more than male models because salary is paid on the basis of the impact which they create."
Feminism is cause for mass suicide and mental illness in men. Feminism is fast disappearing in west and so will in India.. it’s a rotten mindset
Men are more persecuted.

"The man loliness thing isn't completely true , the new generation is changing and now generally extrovert men don't face such things , I myself have very good friendship and we friends do share our professional as well as personal issues and even some of my close  friends have talked about even their 'intimate' issues with me , the only difference is that personal talks between two boys or men always remain only between two of them and a third personal might never no about it, while this may not be always be the case with girls or women."

It's not about competing with each other but working together and bringing best out of it. There're some qualities in which men are better and in some women are better. So no comparison at all I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.

is the definition of feminism given in the dictionary directly related with the demands of feminist.. i don't think so. also you have not defined toxic feminism
So well put together! LOVE IT
"You are amazing Dhruv Bhai ! Whenever you post any video, i will be very interested. Many Youtubers have talked about the feminist issues, but your view upon  it was quite different to see. In fact, I am happy that you talked about Men's problem about loneliness and the emotional thing. No one taks about it. That's why it's a burden for some men that they can't even get emotional about something that hurts them. Proud of you MAN ❤😊"
👍👍❤️❤️❤️
Problem isn’t Patriarchy. Real problem is women getting to choose from Patriarchy and feminism as per their convenience. This oppresses males as they now have to provide and act as Patriarch while also giving so called equal rights.
Best video i have ever seen on the true value of feminism. I am not from india but i always watch your videos. Your worknif very informative and well researched.

"There are some foreign toxic feminist that just ruins the actual feminism word, I myself used to relate feminism as just giving full control to women and supressing men. Like, some toxic feminists just stop using the word the words including 'men', 'king', 'male'. Like using 'walQUEEN' instead of 'walKING' 😂"

"नमस्ते ध्रुव जी,
मेने आपको और आचार्य प्रशांत जी को सुनकर अपने जीवन में क्रांतिकारी बदलाव पाए है। में जानता हूं और शायद आप भी जानते है की आचार्य जी आज महिला सशक्तिकरण और हर अंधविश्वास, झूठी परंपराओं और मान्यताओं के विरोध में बात करते है। वो आज समाज को आइना दिखाने के लिए संघर्षरत है। मेने आपके भी उनके साथ वीडियो देखे है, और आपने उनके काफी विडियोज की clips को भी आपके वीडियो में इस्तेमाल किया है जो की वाकई सराहनीय है। पर आज हमारे पास समय बहुत कम है, झूठी ताकते सर चढ़कर बोल रही है। हम सबको उनकी आवाज को पहुंचाने के लिए प्रयास करना पड़ेगा और अपने अपने स्तर पर इसको और भी लोगो तक पहुंचाना पड़ेगा, अब मैदान मे उतरना पड़ेगा। इसलिए आपसे सलाह और विनंती दोनो है की जब आपके पास इतना बड़ा प्लेटफार्म है तो आप भी अपने वीडियो में उनके चैनल का या और भी सामाजिक मुद्दों से रिलेटेड वीडियो के बारे में लोगो को बताएं।"

"As a feminist, it was really hard to explain it to boys (mind the word 'boys' not men) that feminism ≠ misandry. And thank you for showing how patriarchy affects men too."
"This video is a little shallow on many topics. The things he’s saying now is what I used to think in my 12th. Now after 5 years my thoughts have matured a lot that’s why I think there are more points here on each topic that can be added here. Also I’m more than half way through the video and there’s nothing about toxic feminism yet. It’s all about men. Which are valid points but I think these are sensitive topics and should not be portrayed partially. ( Dhruv feels a little partial towards females, which I’m not saying is a bad thing. But here he needs to be neutral) Anyways for me this video has nothing new to offer. Maybe I have outgrown from his audience. Am I the only one who feels like this?"
Thanking you very much Dhruv ❤❤

"I am speaking from Bangladesh. I think women's rights are given more importance in Bangladesh than in India.  It is in politics, society and many other areas.  The prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, the main opposition leader, are women. Also, Bangladesh's factories, which are one of the sources of Bangladesh's income, most of the workers there are women. I think India should pay attention to this aspect."

"this comes from the basic biological term femininity and masculinity. This is why during the prehistoric era, a man always went hunting, and females stayed in the house. This continues till date and females will date a man only if he a higher value than him/her. this is because they naturally seek protection and safety and want a good man to continue on her genes. Please reply @dhruvrathee  if you are watching this and share your thoughts on this"

"Now that I think about it....the last time my best friend cried was in our childhood...he cried because he did not get admission to his desired school with a very good score, but his friend got admitted even when he had 30 points lower than my friend because he was SC/ST category. I consoled him that day. But since we have grown up, I've never seen him cry again. And I know the reason why....his friends off course!! It's a matter of shame in their friends circle if you cry.

Another incident of my school:- I was passing by a group of senior boys in the playground who were practising shotput. When a boy threw a shot, another boy commented, ""Kya bhai ladkiyon jaisa fenk rha hai!"" Which made that boy embarrassed....
That comment offended that boy & me at the same time. I felt like I wish I hadn't listened because now that comment will forever stay in my mind rent-free.
Such things definitely should be the reason for ""Smash Patriarchy"".
It does no good to men & women both."

So Dhruv Rathi all points are good and agreeable to everyone or every people like me. But according to me Toxic feminism is a thing when a immoral girl or women takes advantage of a women's right against a boy or men just to be in safe side even the fault is her's.

"The main issue is with the word 😅

Before watching this video, I thought feminism means max power in the hands of women. So, I was with gender equality but not exactly with feminism.

Using the word ""gender equality"" makes more sense to me as the term ""feminism"" could be misleading 😅😅"
There is no need for feminism.Can anyone tell me what rights males have over females or just tell me any policy which only benefits males?

"ये सोसायटी ऐसी है की अगर लाडकीयो का दुःख ही तो दुःख AUR लाडको को तो दुःख होतं ही नाही ऐसे रिॲक्ट किया जाता है 

सबसे आच्छा होगा की हम सब सोसायटी क्या कहेगी इस्पर ध्यान ना देकर सिर्फ खूद क्या करना  चाहते हैं वो करे 

इस्मे सिर्फ एक gender के लोगो की गलती नही है  कुछ आदमी aur कुछ महीलाये इन्की सोच ही इज तरह की है 

सबसे ज्यादा प्रमाण इन्मे 1965-1985 तक पैदा हुये हुये लोगो की है 
इस जनरेशन के लोगो का एक ही कहणा है की लाडकी को पाढाके कूच नाही होता .

Aur अभी सिर्फ उनकी नही ज्यादा गलती आभिं ki लडकियो ki ही है मतलब जो Genze मे आती है वो उनको उनके मा बाप school पढाई के लिये भेजाते है aur वो क्या कर रही है जिन मा बाप ने  उनको बचपन से संभाला उनही को धोका देंगी aur घर से भाग जायेगी अपने बाप का kuch भी नहीं सोचेंगी


मैं ये नहीं कह रहा की लडकियो को प्यार नहीं करणा चाहिये लेकीन अपणे मा बाप को धोका भी नहीं देना चाहिए ना

"Ok at first I w was thinking he's gonna be impartial in his view but clearly he isn't. Yes many of the feminist didn't support Neha dhupia or that Zomato girl that's because of they did their image would be applied. Women also only pick on films where the women is abused. It's the same thing both ways. But you cannot argue the fact that women get maternity leave but men don't?. Women can slap but men can't?. Women have reservations men don't?. Yessir I will.acceptball these things if u give men the right to do with women what they would do with men. But no. In the name of equality women get special treatment and men are discriminated against. This man spoke only of the negative effects of patriarchy. Lmao dude till this day let's assume it was a patriarchy what happened?. So many kingdoms were conquered in a patriarchy, all these developments happened due to patriarchy. The roads u travel on was built by a man. Give women that job they'll likely effin drop dead. Just watch bear Grylls video where he left women and men seperately on an island. The women began to cry for the men. That's why the man is always above the woman. I don't say women are useless. Without them something called home is incomplete. Dhruv also missed the fact that women consider working at home and taking care of children as inferior to what men are doing. This is a mindset problem not that of who's on top. When men are running most of the country there should be some rights for them that women shouldn't have. But that doesn't make them inferior. You get your motherly privilage don't u. Also he is bashing the boys on Instagram for no reason. They post reels on how men ignore Distraction to focus on their goals or how they don't care if it's a woman who's bothering them. This statement is only understood by men but whenever a female calls you for help you get 10x stronger for no reason. And as for the loneliness and no crying thing  that actually makes us feel like we have conquered something once the dust has settled. So what is my final point? Well women have a mindset issue and are trying to change something that was in place for centuries and expect a smooth transition which isn't. Let me give u an example. There are 2 men a strong one and a smart one. The strong one lays the bricks for the building while the smart one plans the building. Women asking for rights is like the smart one asking to lay bricks. Even if he got it he wouldn't be useful and would be a waste of energy. He was built to be smart not strong. Similarly if the strong one was making the plans it wouldn't go great either. I respected dhruv in most of his videos but this was a let down. He missed all key points of the struggle. He thinks women are righteous and fight only for equal rights but in fact it's quite the opposite. U all know of nirbhaya case where 4men r@ped and killed a woman and we're executed but there's another case called Shabnam Ali case where a women killed 7 of her family members but was given just life in prison?. How is this equality?. So ur telling me life of 1 women is more important than that of 7 (including old men and children). This is the era we live in. Men stay strong we were built to Maintain law and order. Crush any resistance you face be it friend or foe. Feel free to reply this is one of the domains I have to dominate"

Amazing content really impressive not only women but men should also watch this
Great work. Very well explained❤
The first time in my life I understand the meaning of feminism
"Wonderful video. Explained it very well with examples. However as expected from Dhruv, there is not even single mention of muslim community which is far behind in women rights compared to any other community. Garud puran bhi aya, Hindu culture bhi aya, france bhi aya, male issues bhi agaye which is Wonderful but somehow i knew in the beginning itself that Druv is going to mention Hinduism and Hindu culture but won't mention the religion or culture where feminism is need of the hour."

"Nature made Men and Women differently and gave them different field of expertise if a doctor tries to be engineer he might gain some success but in the long run he will fail. Same as a woman tries to do the jobs that should men do they will suffer from lot of responsibility. Men are the protector women. A Father's responsibility is to protect his daughter, A husband responsibility is  to protect his wife. Women has also responsibility towards Men. A woman is the power of a men. A son can be successful by the help of his mother. A husband gets mental support from his wife. In my opinion men and women should equally get education but in job sector if a woman tries to do the jobs of a man she has to become a woman and a man at the same time that's unfair for a woman. A man should give financial support to a family and a woman should give practical presence in the family but in running the house both man and woman should be a companion to each other. A man should not dictate the house. If you want to match to puzzles together if have to put them correctly not to cut them and make them equal and then try to put them together. That's not how it works 😔"

How many times you will change the click bit(thumbnail) 🤣
You nailed it bro❤❤
"The word should have been something like ""Equalist ,Equagenderist, Genderightist"". Why did they name it as Feminist. I feel like there's a big problem in that term itself. The word itself gives the feeling that it prioritizes female more than male instead of equality between two genders. It may sound kinda stupid but I am just sharing how I feel about that term specifically.

By the way, I want to hear your opinion on the Population declination problem in the developed countries, where I believe that one of the main causes is the idea of Independent woman(who can live without having a man as her life partner).  Hope, this comment reaches you."
Not sure ... this seems too generalized ... i never seen anyone talking all mentioned statement in Father's Generation (political & religious plp excluded) ... May be my Grand mother may be agree with some .

The powerful topic
I always motivete with you!
The reason why it has become toxic is because some don't know the meaning of feminism. Some extreme feminists say they don't need men at all which is stupid. Both men and women need each other.

"First time kisi video se sehmat nahi hai. 😅 men ko men hone ke liye suruwat se treat kiya gaya hai aur wo hai v waisa. Lekin women kafi satir hoti hai,  islye auroto ko kabil banna padega. Aap women ke andar hi dekhoge jo aurat job karti hai unka behavior ek house wife ke taraf kaisa hota hai lekin ek job karte hue logo ka behavior same hota hai."
That's really so important to explain to men that if women are allowed to be independent and have a good life equal rights and feel safe will help men too....some of thier burdens will be shared and they won't have to keep everything inside.....this was the first point after getting a job and falling in love I realized that my love for him even in his struggling days was not about gifts and money spent by him by memories and what we can do together and money not involved from his side made our relationship more selfless and it made me feel less obliged and more loving towards him....coz somewhere I knew in my heart my love was just for his personality and traits that will never go unlike momey

"There were many evils in India before independence.  Some of these evils are:

 polygamy

 Purdah system

 tradition of Sati

 Ban on widow remarriage

 no education for girls

 female foeticide

 child marriage

 Caste System

 Ban on women's education and widow remarriage

 Disrespectful behavior towards widows

 communalism

 dowry system

 To remove these evils, social reformers launched movements from time to time.  After independence, now these evils are negligible.  However, many evils are still seen in India.



 Many thanks to all those great men and great women who tried to stop these evils.


 We all are lucky that we got the Constitution of India which has provisions to protect the interests of everyone.

"First time I’m seeing one of your videos and didn’t learn anything useful. Feminism was to bring equality, but at this point I see Men being the disadvantaged sex."
"The problem is not feminism. The problem is that instead of educated intellectuals representing feminism, we've made narcissistic celebrities the face of it and they've exploited the concept for their own gain. 4 more shots please is more talked about than Kaplana Chawla. 
The other ugly side of it is our appeasement politics which has resulted in a legal system that leads to exploitation of men. In a corrupt nation, a new law is just a new excuse for the system to rob you of your resources."

What an explanation ❤😮wow
People don't want any reforms..they want revenge..
❤❤❤❤
No body could have explained it better ❤ Nice clickbait btw😂
Again Mass Media😂
Finally someone whom we can trust because I have never seen any video in his channel degrading women
I always knew what is true feminism but just like we evolve as a human being feminist also evolved themselves..now it is not about equality if it was there was not more than 75% of men getting accused of false rape cases ...no one in feminism and feminist is wanting govt to change the laws into gender neutral laws .... men's are doing suicide because of this ...our laws are made to make men suffer ..there should be consequences if a women falsely accused someone of rape voilence and dowry...

Other's on 14 Feb : 🪖❤ Meanwhile Dhruv Rathee 🗿
"A great work of research. You have presented this issue so clearly and perfectly but I would like to diagree with your point on men's depression issue. I think the society has been like this since very old times that men have to face what comes ahead of them without ranting what they feel about it in front of their family members so as to not worry them and not make them feel like the head of the family ( not referring patriarchy here) himself is breaking apart and hence they feel weak in exchange. And also due to this expeessing feelings thing, men's suicidal rate has increased because of obviously the patriarchal thinking of the women that this man is weak and all. It was not like this in old times."

"If animal is bad, then dragon ball Z is dad"

Yeh debate itni lambi hei ke iss ne khatam nahi hona. It won't reach anywhere.
Say no to drugs & LGBTQ+
a man and a woman can never be same a woman should get every rights she can possibly have but there's a lot of difference between them

"भारत में आजादी से पहले कई कुरीतियां थीं. इनमें से कुछ कुरीतियां ये हैं:

बहुविवाह

पर्दा प्रथा

सती प्रथा

विधवा पुनर्विवाह पर प्रतिबंध

लड़कियों के लिए कोई शिक्षा नहीं

कन्या भ्रूण हत्या

बाल विवाह

जाति व्यवस्था

स्त्री शिक्षा और विधवा पुनर्विवाह पर प्रतिबंध

विधवाओं के प्रति उपेक्षा का बर्ताव

सांप्रदायिकता

दहेज प्रथा 

इन कुरीतियों को दूर करने के लिए समाज सुधारकों ने समय-समय पर आंदोलन चलाया.  आजादी के बाद अब ये कुरीतियां न के बराबर हैं. हालांकि, अभी भी बहुत सी कुरूतियां भारत मे देखने को मिलती है।



बहुत बहुत धन्यवाद् उन सभी महापुरुषों और महान महिलाओं का जो इन कुरीतियों को रोकने के लिए प्रयास किया। 


हम सभी खुश नसीब है की हमे भारत का संविधान मिला जिसमे सभी के हितों की रक्षा के लिय प्रावधान है।

"stress created by patriarchal society also results in decreased fertility in men.. but a feminist society also tries to put stress on a man to become something else.. The problem with humans is that they try to mold everything according to their understanding rather than their observations.. Feminist men try to mold men into something else, which can cause stress again, which would result in decreased fertility... what we need is meditation... one solution for all problems... F this world, society, depression and anxiety..."

feminism is bad for our society but the more dangerous thng is dhruv rathee who is connected to anti-national (terrorist) organisations. Please stop mr rathee. If you want to tell your political views tell the truth about your philosophy about AAP. you are a it cell of aap. you told that vedas are lies. but the most biggest lier is you mr rathee. I appeal to all subscribers to not watch those who tell half truth.

"This video by Dhruv Rathee challenges the idea that feminism is about men vs. women, instead arguing it's about smashing harmful gender roles that limit everyone. It explores how both men and women suffer under patriarchal expectations, and showcases real feminist heroes who fought for equality for all. Join the call to create a world where everyone can be their true selves, free from outdated norms and expectations."
Brilliant..thank you for this.

"दिलीप कुमार के टाइम के एक्टर और एक्ट्रेस ही वास्तव में समाज में एक अच्छी वुमन का प्रीतिनिधित् करती है।
आजकल ये एक्टर और एक्ट्रेस बस समाज के सामने विलासिता का जीवन कैसे जिया जाए ये प्रदर्शित कर रहे हैं।
इसलिए मेरे आज भी पसंदीदा एक्टर और एक्ट्रेस दिलीप कुमार साहब और मधुबाला जी है।
आज का वुमन एंपावरमेंट भी सिर्फ गरीबों के लिए ही है बड़े एक्टर और प्रभावशाली लोगो के लिए नही।
जब सलमान खान सुल्तान मूवी को लेकर महिलाओं पर गंदा कमेंट केटा है पता नहीं ये वुमन एंपावरमेंट वाले कहा चले जाते हैं।
जब देश की महिला प्लेयर्स के साथ गलत होता है तो पता नही ये कहा चले जाते हैं।
जब आजकल की एक्ट्रेस अपना सबके सामने खुला बदन को एक स्वतंत्रता के नाम पर पेश करती है तो वुमन खुद ही अपनी स्वतंत्रता का कैसे हनन करती है।?

Sir next video for Weight loss by differentiate running and walking fat burn.
"Dhruv i generally support your videos but here you just showed a good side of mirror i believe in mindset treat humans as humans irrespective of gender but unfortunately laws doesnt seems to like this idea we critise feminism not as an idea it should be implemented but not at cost of nerfing men unecessarily 
I know you would never discuss cases like sarvjeet singh bedi or many other fake cases of rape ,dowry,violence which meant to protect women but is now only harming man mostly due to these laws taking woman as victim not being gender neutral but you havent discussed as it doesnt fit your narrative
 today a man is defamed and arrested and not just accqused treated as criminal until proven innocent in criminal case against women, even kerala HC admitted this mistake 
even in civil cases if a man cheats in marriage he has to pay alimony after divorce fair,if a woman cheats in marraige man has to still pay alimony after divorce she gets custody and in order to be safe she files multiple case on innocent husband like marital rape and dowry which leads him to sentence even if he has not done anything because it is way too hard to prove innocent  

even the recent uttarakhand ucc law has live in relationship regulation act but in it only male partner has to alimony if he broke up but if girls dump then there is no such provision there are very less gender neutral laws aur laws to protect men rights 

if you read this comment have gut to reply and deep think on it dont just bend a narrative to push an idea although feminism is important but we should not create a generation of oppressive men rights to push it it should give equal scale by being gender neutral and not being gender bias"
Hope many boys and girls could understand the feminism....😢😢😢
"What a misleading video about indian hindus stand on women, 😂😂this guy never disappoint"
"This is the harsh reality of our society, when someone speaks the truth he/ she has to give lots of proof."
Disappointed with you Dhruv You didn't even explain about toxic feminism for 1 minutes ij your whole 25 minutes video according to you toxic feminism doesn't exist?

Feminism is not right in our country because india belongs to hindu grahant shastra and our grahant shastra is never wrong

"24.00  girl slapping was not the feminism that people were calling out , no one was there to help that guy even the police was not there to help him out because the unfair rights and law are made for women , which made other people not to stop that girl and even police not to detaint her,....
 Clearly she was loudy saying the stuffs like ""ek ladki ko touch karega tu, ek ladki ko tu touch nahi kar sakta hai , "" to the guy who was actually there to stop the girl"
You are right I am not against this but then woman get more education reservations then man

"Problem here is there less of feminist who actually do anything for female rights, and more of the women like neha dhupia who entitle themselves as feminist and makes stupid a claims and argument , problem here is since they are pop culture it's most likely they anyone who is not aware will draw his idea of feminism from them instead of following real feminist"

"Feminist = a person who believe in feminism , and try to achieve change that help women to get equal opportunities and treatment. Someone who support equal right for women is feminist wheather it's a man or women.

"Hi Dhruv! I am one of your fans! Love most of your videos. Been watching you for more than 2 yrs. This will be my 1st comment. 
Its a logical fallacy when you say, men and women should be paid equal. They should be paid based on their work, removing the gender from question. Female only drives which are labelled as feminist are actually matriarchy (well most of the times it's just a gimmick to woo some employees). World has seen many times that quota beyond a point actually does bad, than good. Kalpana Chawla shouldn't be labelled here as a woman astronaut, rather than a intellectual top brain astronaut. The day we stop speaking of sympathizing women in particular (sympathize the weak not any particular gender),  is when they will get true equality. Otherwise, it might turn from a patriarchy society to a matriarchy one as well."
"Na na , jyadatar hypocrite bole hein, jaise gangs of wasseypur cult classic and animal movie provocative and depressed & psychopath person type movie"
your explanation is correct and I fully agree with this. But what what happened to those girls whom feminist did not support but no punishment to the female for a punishable offence. You need to highlight this hypocrisy in our system where punishment to a girl for any punishable offence is hardly happens.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Dhruv Bhai apki lagbhag saari baatein sahi h lekin ek chij ye bhi h ki ek Rojgar Aurat ek berojgaar mard se kabhi shadi nhi kr skti jbki mrd aisa kr leta 
Iss problem ka bhi apko jikr krna chahiye 
Haan iska hargiz ye matlb nhi hai ki mai auraton ki independence k virudh hu"

"Feminism can be good if done right. If not, ya messed up. Badly.

With that being said though, feminism is a movement that started out with good intentions, but its messaging has been so distorted that people are misunderstanding what it actually is, which is, fundamentally, equality of the sexes.

I call it the 'movement of Theseus', akin to the ship of Theseus paradox, basically how much of a well-intentioned movement can be changed, distorted and torn apart until it's no longer what it started out as.

Edit: shows such as Four More Shots aren't feminism. It's buzzwordy, pop feminism that doesn't actually do anything."

Hi
Lots of comments on ANIMAL movie review -> Saw the comments and other videos to manipulate the next video for making viral -> Concluded FEMINISM for the upcoming -> Prepared the video on FEMINISM.
"Let's be honest. Every construct has its own advantages and disadvantages, Feminism included. Not everyone is going to honor it's true values and it's already happening. Hate towards men, ignoring men's issues, excluding trans and gender non conforming from feminist discussions. It's all there if you look at it closely and you need to give an unbiased opinion of it. Which was lacking in this video."

I’m masculinist
Dr Ambedkar was the one person who thought about women and their rights
Pay should be in accordance with our capability rather than gender or race etc.. Both men and women have different roles to play which is equally important for the continuity of human race and functioning of our society. We ought to respect and compliment each other
"A man cannot be a woman,  and a woman cannot be a Man ❤️ stop LGBTQ"
Bhai kisanon ki bhi Awaaz utha lo
"So called fiminist 
Than let the women take their rights from their."
As a man we should have to lead women ... As a man we have control our emotions.... As a man we should be strong.... As a man we should have to respect women .... As a man we should have to learn to live alone. MEN ARE BRAVE. REJECT FEMINISIM.

U made a video on feminism? Or just to rant against men?
"OMG... All the things that you said after @11.25, I actually asked these questions to my students just 2 days back. Will you marry a man who earns 1 rs less than you? Will you marry a man who is 1 inches less in height than you, etc etc, and all the girls said 'NO'"
Mazza aagaya
Why don't you make videos on Indian politics now as u earlier did? You seem to have distanced yourself from it..!
❤... Good video..
"You mostly talked about how people blame feminism unnecessarily. Sadly, you missed the main topic of your video - TOXIC Feminism."
Population control par video bnaaye pls..
"Now, one on castism"
"Everybody talks about women rights but what about indigenous rights, Rarely they talk about..."
You sound like an Id!ot. Far from reality. Fairy tale. Pathetic. The problem with the Feminists is that they think they or their point can`t be defeated. Just ask your wife that would she be with you if you were to be an unemployed guy.
❤❤
So you are faminist
"Ooo Bhai thik he. Just like you said People don't link feminism with those REAL FEMINIST things, same goes for masculinity or alpha males. Those social media are using the word alpha male and promoting toxic masculinity. It's same. People only criticise Movies like Animal and not the movies which actually are feminist and healthy patriarchy.  And the last part woman slapping guy the guy, why didn't you reverse the gender? The guy will get beaten. Bro I like your videos but I think you said many points wrong. Aur  wo log Toxic feminism kehtehe, feminism is toxic nahi kehte. Feminism sahi he we all need it. Toxic feminism ke bare me to thik se battery hi nahi ki apna Jada. Nearly half to man ke bare me lagadiya Bhai. Mujhe laga ye topic toxic feminism ke bade me he. Aur thoda illogical bate to karliya apne"
Mere ghar me matriarchy hai 😅
You don't cover extreme feminist
I respect you for your nice content
India ma larko ko hee equality nahi milta
Thank you for this amazing knowledge.
"How about women treating equal men as losers and they never accept them as their partners unless both are on the top. How about women on social media today exploiting men’s money (read cam girls, OF creators, vulgar reelers, tiktoker etc. exploiting men’s weaker sexual behaviour controls(we admit men have weak self controls but does that make you right to exploit their weaknesses). Bhai ne social media wale large number of women ko consider hi nhi kiya jo galat baat agar aurat ne kiya ho to bhi support karti hain. Iske hisaab se feminist sirf popular celebrity figures hi Ho sakte hain. While talking about patriarchal men he talked about all the Chhapris, like which big male celebrity doesn’t say good things about equality. What a joke but I understand it’s a sensitive topic for men and we can’t open honestly as we get attacked for that. Just stop portraying men always as bad just because some of them are assholes, we all men have to suffer even we  never treated women badly."

- kya tab koi law he jo kisi inocent ko justice dilasake???"
A women is the biggest enemy of other women.
In short we should promote feminism but not toxic feminism.
Man and women are not equal
"At 17:13 you mentioned Cassie Jaye, which is very disingenuous of you. She made a documentary called ""The Red Pill"", which highlights how men's rights are often subject to censorship and dismissal by feminist organizations. She stopped identifying as a feminist after making the documentary as her own documentary was censored by feminists and she received nasty messages from feminists. Equality between men and women would mean that men get all the privileges that women get, which is not something that feminists have ever fought for. As for ""real feminism"" vs. ""fake feminism"" - there is no such thing. Feminism is everything that its used for."
Thank you
"Feminism means equality for men and women in status, pay scale and job opportunities 

However, extreme of feminism - Toxic some claim like Men wears underwear and nothing on top therefore women should also do same and women should wear what they want"
A woman's biggest enemy is another woman

This is called real education❤❤
"Dear brother I completely agree with your video.  Whatever you said is true but actually women understand the meaning of feminist as matriarchy, a concept not only women but our government also do this, now they have come out a rule that if a boy is in a relationship with a girl and a boy said I will marry you but there were some reasons due to which he could not marry her, he could have been jailed for 10 years, whereas if the girl in front of him had done the same thing then she would not have been punished or fined.  Would this be feminism (equality)?  While I have nothing to do with this rule because I am single and only a boy, if I were in a relationship then this would have happened to me too, I have just talked about a rule, I don't know how many other such bad and useless rules are there.  Nowadays feminism in India means matriarchy."

"Bro, you are the best !"
"I thought you would have talk about the toxic feminism prevailing in our society, about how fake rape cases are increasing, about how women are using the equal rights given to them in a very very wrong way. I agree with the patriarchal topic you have discussed but again you also should talk about the latter side"
You have a little misstake.  There is a need of gender equity not equality..  these two word sounds like same. I've done a course on gender education in my B.Ed study. I've read and research on this.   There are  lot of differences in this two words.  Hope you get it.
"The process of evolution is bit too sliw in certain issues like these. We, almost all, love at heart whatever we inherit and truthfully speaking we can't instantly change our mindsets as compared to changing our material possession. Human behaviour is very much intetesting subject but very much ignored.  As such no governments would ever work for such issues. They would leave these things to be solved automatically or on its own.  However, your effort to clarify the  matter is absolutely praiseworthy and eye opening. You seem to be blessed with extraordinary mindset to promote education and peace among people. Hats off to you."
Awesome video 😮😮
I'm agree bro 💯

"का भईया बंगाल का वीडियो भी बनाओ या तुम भी मुहँ बांधे बैठे रहोगे उसपे बाकी लोगो की तरह!!

Islam provides women safety. They don't have to work bcoz girls are the responsibility of her father before marriage and after marriage it's the responsibility of men whom she married. Women aren't equal to men. They have to obey them. But it's not mean this that they don't get their actual rights. In Islam a women is a responsibility of men whom she marries.
Best one dhruv 💪💪

"I still believe in Patriarchy. 
Even if feminism win over patriarchy for once. Patriarchy will again bounce back. Because deep down a woman also admire a patriarchal man. She also wants a man who can lead her. No women wants an emotionally weak men as her partner. 
If you can't hide your emotions your tears then you're not strong enough, whether you're man or woman. These are only the excuses like men have emotions too, men can also cry... to make men weak and to shake the very foundation of patriarchy. I know men have emotions, they cry too. But they should not show their emotions or cry in front of others. Because it not only shows them weak but people also lose interest in them. 

Be a man. Follow patriarchy. It will make you strong. It is harsh for both man as well as woman but remember this harshness is necessary. You can't blame patriarchy for your weaknesses. 

It is okay to expel out the practices like child marriages, sati practice, etc. It is okay to bring equality in terms of education, job, employment, etc. But it is not okay to provide women free seats, free travel services, free ka attention, special treatment just because they are women. If they're equal then why are you giving special privileges to them. Treat them equally.

I want only the pure essence of Patriarchy of producing tough, masculine, hard working, strong, charismatic and leader like men to be preserved.

And this guy Dhruv Rathee is s content creator at the end. He will only focus on the side of what his subscribers want to see. (Left wala left ki taraf bias hota hai. Right wala right ki taraf. This is how they can maintain the traffic over their Channel.)

There is still a lot but can't be expressed in language. You must have to experience. Only then you could understand. 

अंत में बस यही कहना चाहूंगा...
Patriarchy अमर रहे।
Patriarchy अनंत काल तक जीवित रहे।
Jai Patriarchy"
this is only so called room discussion.....not  practical acceptable

You said what's the real feminism is 
Now tell the real truth about patriarchy.
We all should give the right what women deserves. 
You should also talk about the mentality of men and women.
Men and women doesn’t think in the sameway.The nature of men and women are not same.God has created men in such a way that they can handle the external environment.


Again women should get essential rights.
But not equal as men."

What would you call women who fight for the right to choose a man to mate with? I.e. a man who earns more than them, is at least 6 feet tall and extremely handsome. 
Unfair to the men in this case. In a way, using feminism to reinforce patriarchy."

"Hamen wo system apnana chahiye, jo well tried system hai.

Bharat men well tried system hai, Patriarchal.

Yah several thousand years tak successful raha hai.

Feminisim ko introduce karne ki koshish karengen, to hazaron mushkilen aayengi.

Ant men collision hoga.

Jo aaj ho raha hai.

Purush ko nature ne very strong banaya hai femal ke mukable.

Jab dono men than jayengi, to striyon ka large scale men killing hoga.

Isliye, Bharat men mardon ko extra power milna chahiye apni patni ko control karne ka."
Women should respect men too. If a so-called faminist dominates the patriarchy then this is called misogynistic not faminist.

"थप्पड़ फिल्म बड़ी अच्छी है थप्पड़ मारने का हक नहीं है किसी को भी पर अगर फिल्म के  लीड कपल को जेंडेर को उलट कर दे और अगर लड़के को थप्पड़ पड़ता और वह सिर्फ इस आधार पर तलाक मांगता तो यह कैसा होता। वहाँ पर जरूरत थी के माफी की, सही मैसेज की सही विक्टिम तो वह नौकरानी थी । मुझे नहीं पता की हम लेफ़्टिस्ट कितने बड़े हिपॉक्रेट है, जब उस आदमी ने माफी मांगी तो यह क्लाइमैक्स नहीं होना चाहिए। एक माफी तो हम कई बार को लड़ने पर दे देते है खैर भावना पुरुषों में होती नहीं होगी शायद इस फिल्म के हिसाब से । मैं खुद लेफ़्टिस्ट  हूं पर यह सवाल मुझे तब से खाए जा रहा है कई बार फिल्म देखी फिर  मुझे हर बार यह दृढ़ विश्वास हो जाता है कि भले ही आप फेमिनिस्ट हो पर आप मर्द हो तो आपके मत  की कोई वैल्यू नहीं है। मुझे कट्टर  फेमनिस्ट होना या बड़े कट्टर पुरुषवादी होने की बजाए इसके बीच में कहीं उतर कर शादी जैसे रिश्ते को ढूँढना पड़ेगा । मुझे उस वकील का चीट करना भी गलत लगा अग्र उसकी जगह मेल होता तो आग लग जाती । कबीर सिंह भी खराब थी यह भी काफी जगह पर खराब"

"You are changing the narrative bro
Doesn't matter what's the literal meaning of feminism, 
In this era feminism is synonymous to matriarchy and I am not a great fan of that!

But that doesn't mean i support patriarchy. I am always with humanism."
Best part of the video 12:40 . Thanks dhruv bhaiya mai bhi yahi apne man me sochta tha ki agar meri apne bb ke samne bejati ho jaye gi to kya hoga .

"Feminism is good, the only thing is people need to be educated about it. 😊"
"Alright, alright, alright, but do you know the “Nature of Power“.?
Power's nature always achievers, it is impossible establish feminism and make it sustain. Feminism is first step of Matriarchy.
The worst part of social system."
Feminism itself harmful to women herself 😂
"I do have a question to Women who promote Feminsim.
Does feminism allows you to wear short Clothes that shows your body parts .Have you ever thougth is this your parents expect from you while educating you?  Is this you call true Feminism?Have your ever heard Kalpana chawla,Nirmala Sithraman,Smriti Irani showing off in short clothes?
In my opinion feminism implies only certain women who truly understand its meaning.
I too have a mother and sister and they have equal representation in our family and well educated .But they don't fight for equality as they know their limits as a woman."
Dhruv sir please make a video on how girls destroying  young boys on social media by showing their body parts  and look please 😊
Not only India but also the whole world

"The funniest thing is women itself pull down women the most. In many families ( including mine ) , my dad is not 1/10 th as sexist as my mom. Its disgusting"
Man don’t cook man don’t washing clothes. Women don’t earn money women don’t go out n work. Biggest problem is here . Relationship if women cooking why man can’t washing clothes????? If man cooking why women cleaning house???? If man responsible home money matters why can’t they share responsibility????? . Feminism start from home ?????? Drunk wearing naked clothes smoke party it this call feminism?????
It's really important to talk about these types of topics.
If women are getting less salary than men then why companies don’t hire just women 😂
Dhruv sir male female ke dimag ke weight me antar hota hai
Kon instagram k un chhapri ladko mai nhi aata ❤
Girls must be given good educatipn.
"People are really missing the points of this video. The whataboutery has started. Brace yourselves to see comments like:
-What about the girls who have only fans account and call themselves feminists.  
-What about girls who cheat in the name of feminism.  
-What about girls who take allimony in name of feminism. 
-What about fake cases. 
-Why women who want equal opportunities don't do construction work, oil riggs work etc. 
-What did women even invented. 

Didn't yall understand the meaning of feminism? Don't just associate this term with every bad thing women do! There can be bad women they're humans after all! Why do y'all associate every bad woman to be a feminist? Makes 0 sense. Even if she claims to be 1 she's taking advantage of it."
Today s so called feminist and open minded  movies star disgusting women like neena gupta. Its not hard to see that the face of feminism in india are literally anti feminists. Women who star in item songs and movies where women serve purely therole of a love interest are the ones teaching us feminism. Its not hard to see why women are still treated unequally in india. Coz the face of feminism itself are antifeminists

"One of the finest videos I have come across. Thank you for making this video .
As a girl I have always wanted every girl to have equal rights as men and both to be treated equally and used to call myself as a proud feminist.But from the past few years  some of the so called ""feminist"" who started to use this tag to overpower men make the men feel unsafe treated men in a bad way . Started drinking partying molesting men in the name of feminism gave a whole different and a wrong meaning of feminism and I was ashamed of calling myself a feminist . But now I call myself a proud feminist as I was never wrong and never will be . 

And boys choose your examples right feminist would never harm a good man in fact fight for their rights too . We are fighting for equality and not to make you feel inferior to us ❤"
Beautifully explained with proper examples and without any exaggeration. 👌✌️
Wonderful video.
"Its Mind blowing that, why are Men trying for Womens Equal Rights?
Are they Sincere or doing just for their Interests?
Business men give Jobs to Women for Attracting the Costumers!
And there are so many examples!

The Civil Rights should be given to All Womens...but not for the interests of Mens, but the interests of Women☺"

"Ohh Dhruv sir! Your mother, sister, girlfriend, wife, daughter, female friends are one of the most luckiest women.

"Women and Men are not created equal in Islam. Eve creaetd from Adam's Backbone to serve him. If we are equal, How come Women can't lift heavy weight and compete with Men in Sports ?  Truth is they never can. Women's bodies are built differently, So why compare ?

I'm not saying women are inferior, they have their own place in Society. In Islam, Mother is to be respected and Jannah is under Mother's feet. Anyone who thinks women and men are equal is simply promoting a Lie."
Thank you 🙏🏼

"lol u r talking so bull against Alpha males, ehat r alpha males? alpha males is not about letting down females, alpha males is about getting stronger physically n mentally, discipline, n don't hesitate to take challenges. whereas new feminism n as we all see u r the follower of them, they do hate alpha males like u r keep bashing them n showing feminist in a very good light. the reality is different."

"Equality doesnt simply means distribution of equal rights but it means to give equal oppurtunities on the basis of ability by removing disparities from the society.
Men and women are not identical, but they should be treated with equal value and respect. Defining ""equal"" can be complex, and it's important to consider different aspects of life when discussing this issue. Understanding the diversity and complexities within each gender group is crucial for a truly nuanced and accurate perspective. One should also consider Overgeneralization Dangers, Emotional Expression, Cognitive Strengths, Communication Styles, also  Evolutionary Theories, Hormonal Influences, Brain Structure to fully understand the differences in order to provide justice to both men and women.

Liberty cannot be divorced from equality; equality cannot be divorced from liberty, nor can liberty and equality be divorced from fraternity. Dr B R Ambedkar"
Couldn’t have explained it better ❤️❤️
True Indian - Dhruv Rathee ❤
"Dhruvb Ratheem Sitting in a Western Nation teaches Indians - Who worship Mother Goddess Durga on Feminism. This is how low we have fallen - Listening to all the Rascals and Fools of the West, So called Leftists and Champions of Human RIghts.

Every Nation should come up with its own definition of Human RIghts. India has no reason to blindly follow the West."

"""If I may? I would like to post an interesting question.""
Are Humans beings truly equal?
These days everywhere you go there's a talk about fighting for equality..
As a wise man once said, ""Heaven does not create one person above or below another.""
People like to throw his words around, but that's not the whole quote; he goes on to say
That while we are all born equal at birth pretty soon things begin to change.
Academic effort is what sets people apart to rise above the others. At any rate, ....
Humans change over time based on their actions. Truth be told at the end of the day,
""Equality, is just a fantasy And most of us go through life denying the fact that we live in a meritocracy.""
So , do your best; the perfect equality among all beings whether ideological or practical may not subsists but you may still achieve bits of it ' given that you have what it takes to make it possible."
"Thank you for giving me a new insight on the femenist issue alot of the the Men right movement focus on the same men rights. and bringing change to the female mind of hypergamy that results from piatriarchy seems like an impossible goal, so then y move away from traditional safety when falling into traditional roles appear safer than any other way of life at this moment."
the spill bee vs dhruv rathee
Hamesha ki tarah ek tarkik video👏👏👏👍
"Although, I agree to a lot of your views shared on several other topics, I disagree to your talking points in this video.
To start with, Feminism is a women's advocacy movement and feminists are mainly at loggerheads with men's rights movements. You see this clearly in the USA, where most of the tenants of this ideology were formed. 
Feminists would not pursue anything that goes against the detriment of women's rights, benefits, advantages already enjoyed in a patriarchal society e.g. men paying on dates, free entries to women in clubs, etc.. The advocacy and female hyper-gamy have gone beyond control to such an extent in the West that it has become increasingly hard for men to date women, as it clearly creates a bias. The rise in female sex workers and Onlyfans models is to a large extent a product of Feminism."
Ek kameyab mard ek berozagaar aurat se shadi kar sakta hai….par ek kamayab aurat ek berozgaar mard se shadi nahi karti…
"We Hindus should not be influenced by Stupid Western Ideas. 

In Hinduism women and men are not equal. They both have their own roles in Society. People like Dhruv Rathee are manipulating and brainwashing Indian Teenagers to blindly mimic Western Civilization Ideas, 

And the result is India too will become a Lawless, Dystopian, Dysfunctional Society like America or Britain, Inheriting their Problems like Wokes, Leftists, Crime, Shooting and High Divorce rates and Single Parents. Do you want this nonsense in India ? Hell no.

Think of every Nation and Civilization as Unqiue, India should follow its own Definition of Feminism, Human RIghts etc based on our Culture and Religious values. Why ? Because not all shoe sizes fit everyone. We are aell different. A Woman can never be a Man, In HIndu Culture we worship Durga, Great Goddess. We don't need lessons of respecting women from Western Culture whose books tell to enslave female captives of war."

renuka chowdhury bhi berozgar hai bhai.. so called feminist. Yahi hai aaj ka Feminism.
"Insightful video, but including Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's role in advocating for women's rights and social reform could have added depth to this discussion on feminism."
Thank you for sharing the words of many hearts.

"Brain washing ka dhanda bohot accha chal raha

"I can argue with you on 100's of topic you mentioned in the video.... Illogical comparison and a far leftist approach.... Why don't we find womens doing work in oil riggs, deep seas??? .... A unsound mind person might have a right to vote but he can't become a president/prime minister/CJI etc etc... according to your logic he should be made a prime minister isn't it??"

Patriarchy is the reason why women and children were allowed to leave the Titanic not Men.😶
Such an informative and awakening topic and explained  in a humorous way. Kudos to him 🙌.
Undoubtedly i agree wid u but psuedo feminism is a reality too...
"You didn't talked about matriarchy as a problematic thing for both men and women and how some females think that matriarchy is equal to feminism , the problem is the hypocrisy of calling one thing wrong while not talking about the other thing completely"
"11:13 I
I just imagined myself even being a girl an unemployed 😮😢"
"Damn Dhruv, you went all out on this one!!! More power to you my brother!("
"Dhruv bhai app bhi thoda research kr lo .....
Chhapris are a caste-oppressed community of people who made or mended chhappars, temporary roofs. This was the only job they were allowed to do because of their caste, which was assigned to them by the accident of birth."
"This guy doesn't even have the guts to put his opinion straight forward. 
The entire video is based on what others said.
Bro, please make videos on history and facts, and stay away from these topics."
I respect you more today you have mentioned Fatima shaikh with Savitti bai phule…🫡
"It is not illogical mr Dhruv.
Nature has made like this.
She is talking about physical  power and chemical composition. 
Mentally there is no inequality. But power now a days does not come from muscle mass as before. Due to evolve of science these differences in god given characters  are going to lost. I think this shouldn't happen. Don't think that these characteristics of a women make her weak. I want to repeat that now  a days power comes with mental ability. ..To hold a gun you don't want a masculine body.."
Bro sidhu mosewala par video Bana do

You've become my favourite youtuber. You always give unbiased opinions
"I want to request you , make a video on climate change and global warming and its upcoming future of the earth"
"Dhruv, why are there gender specific jobs ?? Why only certain gender is asked to work in shifts or field jobs ?? Which was the last time you saw gender equality in shipping industry, oil rigs, heavy machine operators and manufacturing of ships/trains, asphalting of roads. Equality should mean Equality right ????
Khud women bhi kehti hai ke tum itne narm hoke uski baat kyun sun rahe ho., tum bhi sunao usko....."
Mind blowing Dhruv. Another brilliant video with exceptional research.
Kon kon feminist hai ❤
Best video 🎉😊
"So if you want to fight for equal rights then call it equallim. Anything at first moves like normal then becomes toxic..
Just look at American Culture, in 1950s they used to be living like family. A child would be  bring up by both parents. Now most of the American girls want to be a bitch or slut. This is the final product of Feminism believe me. Every girl like America will be trying to earn money by selling their body in online than working hard."
Well most of the feminist on instagram are online whores the have onlyfans they *PROUDLY* sell their nudes saying that we are bold feminist what about them
"Of Course Respect To

Bhai sahab isne to feminism ke favours ke baare mein bataya lekin fake feminism se pareshan hote hue men ko jo asar padta h uska kya...rules wagera Jo heavily favour kar Rahi h women ko unjustified way pe uska kya...saja milti h koi galat ho to women ko minimal and men ko maximum kyun?
Both male and female deserve equal rights ❤❤❤❤
This is disagree topic today I have seen you talking
"Patriarchy is a mindset, ingrained in us through our culture for generations… feminism is the outcome… however, both are used in hypocrisy, political gains and to show off sometimes 😃… Education is the only way to address this instead of blaming anybody… to change the culture is not that easy… social media platforms, unfortunately, the place where people are turning to for answers is actually toxic… inexperienced people make comments about chronic issues… By God, I feel it’s going to be one jumbled up world 😅😅
Thank you Dhruv, for your perspective!"
"abe wide view leke chalna jhattu sirf women perspective se kyu dekh raha, male or female dono ke perspective se sochega toh janne ga dono ki life mein bohot unfair chize hai par uska matlab ye nhi ki unn chizo ko humesha brag karke sympathy beg karo balki usko overcome karke awareness felao par nhi tujhe toh one sided baate karni hai"
❤❤
I haven't heard any women ever saying she does not like cake.😅😅
Well hes right  but as far as i know   men  and  women  already have  equal rights   and   what needs to be  treated is the mindset
"I love you Dhruv!!!!!! You’re not a green flag, you’re a GREEN FOREST!!!!! i swear😭😭🤌🏻🤌🏻❤️❤️"
"Lol, you sourced Salman Rushdie."
Iske hisab se ye Aur to ko uksa raha hai ki woh esi society me bahar nikle jaha aurto ko sex object tret kiya jata hai europe me toh aisa hi hota hai porn industry se leke chadiyo me ad karaye jate hai aur india me aur  bura haal hai aurto chahe woh 4 saal ki bachiya ya phir 90 saal ki aurto tak ka rape hota hai yeh sirf suggestion dega security aur kuch hone par justice toh bhul hi jao
"11:20 
I imagine myself"
"The idea of feminism is just to promote equality amongst genders and ensure that everyone, regardless of their gender, has the same rights, opportunities, and respect. It's about breaking down societal norms and stereotypes that limit individuals based on their gender, and striving for a world where everyone is treated fairly and with dignity. Feminism isn't about hating men or putting one gender above another; it's about creating a more inclusive and just society for all."

"In Islam, it is very clear. Women are more respectable than men. Men are responsible to take care of their women. If a woman wants to do some professional work, it is quite ok. Islam wants the social fabrics well knitted so that the little kids don't suffer psychologically. They should have their mum available for them to pacify their emotion until they get mature. It is not about male or female, it is about a whole society. We are not confused like anybody else in India or west."

"Ok but u didn't told us about "" TOXIC FEMINISM"""
In socialmedia most of the men which are educated they also don't know the real mean of what feminism is but in the term of truth there are also dark side and negative effect of both side feminism or patriarchy concepts most of the people by using the name of feminism miss gide the females so then some of the females starts to disintegrate mans. By my own opinion both feminism and patriarchycal mind sets are acceptable but in limits and without knowing the real defination of these cocepts the people on the social media shouldn't miss guide the people by the of alfa male or gender equality

"….PREMATURE EJACULATION minus ➖ FOREPLAY is equal 🟰 to RETENTION of male & SQUIRTING of female: Coitus Pleasure or Penetrative Pleasure!

Simply, legs 🦵 over man’s shoulders while lying on her back, need to introduce the LIMPY MANHOOD without trying to achieve full massive erection!

After introducing, simply push gently without trying to withdraw manhood like a piston; simply keep pushing the PUSSY 🐈‍⬛!

Brain 🧠 is the largest S*x organ, so better to avoid anxiety; breathe 🧘‍♀️ deeply but slowly in and out because brain 🧠 consumes 20% (50 ml/min) of the total body consumption of oxygen (250 ml/min) though brain 🧠 weighs only 2% ( 1,400 gms) compared to body’s weight of about 70 kg!

So breathe 🧘‍♂️ deeply and push gently - play instead of foreplay - by massaging the breast simultaneously while pushing into pussy with application of seed pressed oil like 👍 mustard or olive 🫒 oils; massaging of breast squeezes out old blood 🩸 and secretions allowing fresh blood 🩸 to come in to nourish the breast tissues thus preventing inflammatory lumps and cancer!

Also, men release the three preparatory secretions Viz. Prostatic, Cowper’s and Seminal Vesicles before SPERM, the 4th secretion! Better to stop before SPERM release, the 4th secretion because it is too expensive for the body with growing age!

This Posture allows massaging of Clitoris from outside (glans of Clitoris) and inside (the root of Clitoris called G-Spot)

"The problem is that the ""so called Feminist"" who call themselves Feminists, just like the real ones which causes a lot of problems when we meet new people who are a ""feminist"" coz we obviously can't know what they actually mean when we newly meet them. Secondly, a lot of men and women have shown support to the real feminism movement, however the there is not much condemnation from women against the fake feminists.

I believe that the real feminists think that condemning the fake feminists will weaken the cause, however, in reality, it will only strengthen it."

Thanks dhruv bhai
Dhruv put on toxic feminism in thumbnail but didn’t talk enough abt the uprising toxic feminism in the world which is concerning
Maturity is when u realise man and woman aren't equal.... dhruv Rathi I am always ur one of the biggest supporter....but India is not as simple as u think....I repeat man and woman aren't equal.... Indian log dharti ko mata bhi mante hain aur pair jute kahi achhi chizo pe lag jaye to bhagwan se maafi bhi mangte hai ...u Just can't ignore importance of both .....but it is not equal at all. I hope u got my point.

Great video.! Can someone tell me the background music piano used from 2:55-3:30
Sir imran khan ki come back par video banao
"Long text warning!! But please read if you have time, it's just my opinion/observation (No hate):

what you defined in feminism, is perfectly fine in theory.
feminism is all about equal rights for all men & women. I do understand that. and I believe, almost everyone who use internet in a mindful way knows the real meaning of feminism. So, men aren't hating feminism because they don't know what feminism is. It's because there's a difference between theory & practical. 

Let's understand it in this way,
in school/college when we study topics related to physics & stuffs, we are 1st taught the theory behind that topic. In the theory everything is perfect, everything is beautiful, everything just works flawlessly because there's not many complications (we assume/neglect lots of things for simplicity's sake). 
But then we are sent to perform the same thing in a practical lab, then we observe that whatever we've learnt in theory is not completely matching with how things work in reality. Because reality doesn't work with our assumptions/we can't just neglect any parameter as our wish. With that we always come to the conclusion that, it's ok to assume things in theory for simplicities sake but you can't just neglect the randomness of reality, because reality is what matters the most.

Now, where am I going with this one? Well, the definition of feminism/the massage that it portrays is great as long as you're just saying it, like in theory.
But, do we really see the practical implementation of feminism in our society? Do we really see people use feminism with gender neutrality? NO!!!!
Whenever women do something stupid, majority of the time(what I've observed), then they start playing the ""w"" card in the name of feminism, that they have all right to do anything/wear anything/it's her choice/none can give her even an advice(not even father or husband), because they say men are controlling them & they are free/will do anything they want. Why? Because they are true feminists(they say). They believe in women empowerment & all. I have never seen any guy do unethical things in the name of feminism, if fact men don't even use feminism even when they themself are suffering. 

I'm not talking about those movies that you've mentioned. It's happening in real life. And this number is a lot, A LOT!!!!!! And increasing!
If in practical/reality these feminists believe so much in equality, then where were they when women were charging men for false rape cases & the men went to jail. And after a long time, the rape case was proved false, and the man's life/career is destroyed. But still, nothing happened to the women. Why no feminist talked/even cared about it. Even I've read comments of girls saying, ""whatever happened it was perfect, men need to suffer, because men also rapes women"" (that's their logic)!

Where were your feminism, when women were openly abusing/slapping men (even in house)? And the men can't do anything because he knows that if he does something, the public would beat the living hell out of him & those so-called feminists are abusing their ""feminist""/""women"" card for these reasons. And at the end, nothing happens to the women, people give the man sympathy by saying, ""she's a women, what can we do after all."". everyone acts as if it's no big deal. But if the gender were reversed, then it would be a huge HUGE issue. everyone will blame the man so hard & he will go to jail for assaulting. And also, she can file a rape case on him as a bonus!!!

See, pretty easy to describe feminism but reality is much complex. Not saying you should hate feminism. but instead of feminism, we should follow equalism/rights for all souls on earth. I know feminism does the exact same thing. But it is being misused so much in society (specially women abuse it so much) because, feminism has the word, ""feminine"" in it.
I think we should promote equalism more than anything.
Anyways loved the video though"
"aaj the videos are not that interesting dhruv, make some videos related to history more interesting"
Do you believe in LGBTQ?
"thanks to feminism in the last 80 years we have the most naked, nude, porn-producing women today than ever in human history.  I look forward to a day when Dhruv's daughter will have the right to choose to create multiple-category porn and spread in the near future.  Who needs traditional tested moral values and roles, the future is bright and more hedonistic.  If you find this offensive then you are mentally ill and backward.  GET with the PROGRAM - you have not been woke, socially conditioned, and brainwashed yet."
Jaldi Jaldi comment kar deta hu like milange😂😂😂
WE SHOULD REPLACE THE TERM FROM FEMINISM TO EQUALISM AS IT WILL CAUSE LESS CONFLITS AND MORE PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND IT EASILY.
I totally agree with you but men get high paid because they work more than women & majority of women who believe in equality they always prefer rich guy over a struggler  & there is no patriarchal mindset on such women because most of them are feminist
"okay if there should be equall rights can a man slaps back a woman if she slaps a man, or use abusive language or try take advantages of being a woman should a man response back equally ?"
"You should have to give a solution in the end of the video for degrading patriarchy in our society like Spreading Awareness about what Feminism stands for , how patriarchal mindset doesn't allow to develop for whatever group (like - family, Society etc) and make a period for this topic in school to have discussions about so that future generations could understands the values and virtues that a girl carries . Thankyou sir..... What a explanation ❤"
"Amazing video, so informative and very well explained."
Great content as always. The problem with so-called feminist these days don't know the difference between feminism and ego towards man.
"And this same issue continues to our laws where Rape can only happen to a woman and not a man, woman can file a fake dowry, domestic violence case and other cases and there’s no way a man can legally get out of these cases. 
After divorce, Only a man has to maintain the woman her whole life irrespective of if he earns or not. 
The court told a man that do what ever you have to do, steal, take a loan or earn, but maintain your wife or you’ll be jailed."

This video is just sad, and more so for the reason that I look really look forward to ur videos, this is outright disappointing ☹️☹️"

Equality and similarities both are different thing ... don't mix them ... girls are girls and boys are boys... anyone may lead the society who have skill... Dhruv is talking about feminism is good ...he is strongly opposing patriorchy but he is not opposing toxic feminism so much strongly...you can deduct it from his video....than you for coming and four more shots are worst thing that can be promote on the name of feminism ...jitna gali do en directors ko utna km hai ...
Thank You so much Dhruv Rathee for taking up this topic!

"To all the men out there don’t get too emotional after watching this video, it’s high time you avoid getting married cause there is zero merit in it and also remember there are no laws that help men over a women in the court even if it’s the women’s fault. Even if a women files a false case against you, you’ll still go to prison and may or may not be released after years even when found not guilty. 80% of cases filed against men by women are false cases, they know that laws are in favour for them and against men, so they’ll take complete advantage of it. Nobody is equal in this society and it’s not gonna change not just gender wise but as human itself, the faster you realise that the simpler life gets."

"Can you please stop the bookish definition, and get into the real world? I consider myself logical and rational, but i am not a feminist. Which equal right does a woman not have which a man have? But there are literally laws and rights that are anti men. There is no gender based wage gap, if it exsisted, and employers were able to get away with that, no one will ever hire men. Feminists fighting for men's rights? 😂😂😂😂.. thats so laughable.  You said patriarchial women are forced to do household, ok, then please give an answer on how come if the most higher earning women, wants a man earning more than her. And there are have been research papers that have stated that since most average women are not physically strong compared to most average men, then try manipulation and shaming tactic. The numbers of s*****de  is more in men than in women, and the most prominent reason is not patriarchial mindset, its woman. Right to vote is US was only given to men, cause men went to wars. In India, women can divorce men for the pettist of reasons, but for men to get divorce, it is uphill battle. I literally disgust cheaters, regardless of genders. Kisi feminist ne nahi kaha ki Neha Dhupia ne jo kaha so sahi tha, but kisine unhe criticise bi nahi kiya. Kisi feminists ne support nahi dikhaya, but criticise b nahi kiya."
"In short he's saying, women are better than men. Ok👍🏻"
I hate you
"In India men & women have equal rights and opportunities in all sectors.
Not relevant this video in India but definitely for Pakistan Afghanistan and other arab countries where women are not treated equally"
Adjust you are a money minded
I don’t like you more not more just your stupid
"the concept of feminism is different today, it is more like letting girls roam naked and forcing boys to not to call them a whore, Dhruv your concept of feminism would only work on a planet with100% ethical education, on this world of the quote of a famous philosopher Rousseau suits, a man can be forced to be free, and apart from that we live in a society where no one will do good until a law or a punishment isn't there. It is the social, religion and jurisdictional punishment fear which makes people to behave good on this planet, More liberty could only create chaos in every corner of the world."
I like you Video but when you review about the animal that the movie
Toxic feminism ke Against baat karne ke liye video banaya tha bhaine wapas wahi Toxic Feminism ka gyan hi chaap diya😂
"@Dhruv, first of all, thanks for making video on such a complicated topic. Your presentation is mind blowing as always. But I think you have oversimplified some things and I want your opinion on some of the things that you missed.

1) You mentioned that the women who believe in patriarchy do so bcz of normative confomity. That is - they only do so bcz of societal norms. But is it totally true? Isn't patriarchy also very ""convenient "" for girls? As mentioned in the movie Barbie, due to patriarchy, women don't have to take hard decisions, they don't have to face harsh conditions that men are trained to embrace. Don't you think many women like this? Which brings me to the next point 

2) If we are talking about ""equal"" rights- sure, I'm up for it. But I want equality in every front. Not just for the powerful or gainful situations. I want equal number of females soldiers fighting equally at the forefronts of wars for all countries. I want equal number of women in hardworking jobs like plumbing, construction work, sewage cleaning, moving and packing services etc. Is everyone up for it? 

3) Why should the very term that speaks about ""equality"" start with ""females""? I understand the historical point of view but since we are trying to change the society, should not we choose a term that sounds more gender neutral?

4) You compared males and females as 75% same in terms of physiological norms. Being a PhD in Molecular Biology, let me tell you that Males and Females are different in terms of chromosome (XY vs XX) that is the very beginning of life. And there are many other differences physiologically such as bone density, muscular structure, hormonal composition etc. that you oversimplified. Men and women are complementary to each other. Although, I think overall your presentation agrees with this concept but still the representation is slightly misleading. 

My overall take is - we should believe in ""equity"" of rights rather than ""equality"" of rights. ""Equality"" is a very oversimplified, vague term that creates confusion. ""Equity"" refers to giving everyone same opportunities whereas ""equality"" refers to giving everyone same outcome. They sound similar but are very different. Stay well and keep making good videos."

"I wanted a boy not too much but at least a few inches taller than me to get married, rest everything I was ready to accept but after watching this video I realised that this is also a kind of patriarchy 🥲... Thanks for clearing my concept. No more filters for outlooks of my groom 😌."

"Bhai himmat hai to ye feminism wala topic muslims ke context mein dikhaa na. Unki hi community ki women mostly zyaada oppressed hai compared to any other religion in RECENT TIMES.
Sachai dikhaane ki jhaant bhar ki aukaat nahi hai aur gyaan dene chala aaya lodu"
"The main problem is people don't differentiate between toxic feminism and feminism. The current generation mostly support toxic feminism such as ' we don't need men, we can do whatever we want'. You will find many feminists (general people)  who say I'm feminist but then objectify men and want all the perks. Mostly they focus on bringing down men by uplifting female when it should be equal. Hence people start to believe toxic feminism = feminism. 

Another problem is feminists come forward to discredit films like animal but do they show that much aggression when  they say 'four more shots is toxic?' Some even don't talk at all."

Thanks for awareness
"I think most feminists also dont know the true meaning of feminism as explained brilliantly by dhruv, many think its only about supporting womens movies, even if they brainwash you li,e barbie, (if you watch it yo'll get a strong narrative that women in usa are still supressed in the work places, the world is only controlled by males and stuff like this)respectfully , you shoud have talken about this, i have literally seen many of the women writing hastag barbie on ig and claiming that they are bycotting oppenheimer only because they are ""feminists""."
we dont need simps they should leave our gender
What about women merry with women ? Mera jism mari marzi ...in short ur faminist u disappoint me today
simps are not the part of our gender we don't accept them as mens they are impotent they should leave men gender  identity and adopt woman gender

"The Hindu Code Bill refers to a series of laws aimed at reforming Hindu personal law in India. It was a significant legislative effort initiated by the Indian government to bring about social reform and gender equality within Hindu society. The Hindu Code Bill sought to address issues such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and adoption among Hindus, which were previously governed by traditional customs and religious practices that often discriminated against women.

The bill was primarily championed by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and other social reformers. However, it faced strong opposition from conservative elements within Hindu society. Despite this opposition, the Hindu Code Bill was eventually passed in various iterations between 1955 and 1956, marking a significant step forward in the quest for gender equality and social justice in India.


Dr. B.R. Ambedkar he, was a strong advocate for women's rights. He believed in gender equality and fought against discrimination based on gender. Ambedkar emphasized the importance of education for women and their participation in the workforce. He was instrumental in drafting laws that aimed to improve the status of women in Indian society, including the Hindu Code Bill, which sought to give women equal rights in matters such as marriage, inheritance, and property ownership. Ambedkar's vision for women's rights was rooted in social justice and equality for all members of society.

This bill was even for upper caste women he was a great polarized leader

"Equality is a very confusing word. Let's say I have 2 friends, one is skinny and another one foodie. If I invite both of them in a dinner and offer them an equal amount of food, that will be equal, but will not be justice. The moral of the story, who works/ contributes more, must be paid more. This civilization isn't built by just doctors, engineers, and politicians. We also need oil rig workers, brick labor, construction workers, firefighters, etc. Apply for them as well and get equality."
Right sir

Equality means equality...
What is right for me is also right for you,but if somthing is wrong for me is also wrong for you..
Very educational nd information video...
You kept the pace neutral for both sides ...much appreciable 👏❤"
"King for a reason, hats off to you sir ❤️🇵🇰"
"Complex topic but very well handled by Dhruv..
As a mother of two sons, i worry about them. The burdens,  unsual expectations for men regarding emotions,  money,  jobs.  I hope we all can contribute to change this.."
You are my inspiration sir🙄
I agreed  with you but in indian governet and law is not feminist. Why after divorce  men give money his x wife? Please make a video on this...
Dhruv rathee real GOAT 🎉
When it comes to feminism people these days want equality and at same time they want privileges because they are women this is more critical issue and taking advantages of feminism should also be a topic to be covered !
"I'm okay with femisum. 
But I would like to marry a girl who knows her family role while I earn for them. 
You can call me patriarchal if you want to, but I want my family to grow culturally. If both presents go out, who will take care of the child? You can see that in western countries, where people are less cultural, their families are ruined.
And why are we fighting about equal rights? Which rights are we talking about here? Man and woman both have the same rights, and in many divorce cases, women have more support from the court. And don't tell me why, in western countries where the divorce ratio is high, 95% of divorces come from women who have a college degree. (I'm not saying that women should not be educated, but it's what all statistics say.) Sorry, but if that's the case, I would like to support my culture and play my role in society. And only marry that girl who knows her role in the family and is culturally influenced to take care of my family at home.I don't care if she's educated or not. I'm not against education, but she has to know how our culture has described the role of the wife in the family.
Srimad-Bhagavatam
SB Canto 1
A wife's duty is to follow her husband 100 percent. And Gandhari was so true to her husband that she followed him even in his perpetual blindness.
SB Canto 3
It is the duty of the wife to take charge of household affairs and not compete with the husband.
There are more verses like this for both wife and husband.
We have given equal rights to women. And yes, it's necessary. 
But we can't give the same characteristics to both genders; it's what nature has given us.
If we don't bring back cultural ways of living and living in modernism, we will soon have a problematic future that western countries are going through.
I'm not against feminism, but I'm against cheating, sexism, and a lack of loyalty from both genders."
Ladkiya jyada patriarchal hoti hain.. their actions and their words contradict...
the real agenda of feminism is superiorty not equality
All the womens of our country should know about hindu code bill..which give rights to live respectfully in the society. This bill was introduced by Dr BR Ambedkar in 11th April 1947. Never forget the legends who made our life better to live respectfully in this society 💙🙏
Good 👍 job
"Hi Dhruv, please make a video on the caesarean section pandemic in India. The rise in caesarean sections in India in the past decade is alarming. The vulnerability and helplessness of pregnant women in our society is being taken advantage of by the medical field. Please ..this is an extremely important issue. No one talks about it.  
And thank you for today’s video. It was amazing. Hats off to your courage."
You are magnificent dhruv💛
"@Dhruv Usually your videos are quite detailed but this one felt lacking. So many claims, and barely any proof. Throughout the video I kept thinking citation needed! citation needed!!

It is true that men are not allowed to cry. But tell honestly, how often do you cry? If you cry, does your life partner see you with respect? The attraction falls steeply once the man cries, that's the bitter truth.
And why do you even believe that men need to cry. Sounds like you have started agreeing with what you hear from other feminists.
Maybe men feel naturally better by completing challenging activities.

Yes Feminists claim that men need to cry for their own mental well being. But how do we know that's the truth. Maybe that's only true for women. Biologically speaking, women have smaller tear ducts, so, if a man and a woman both are about to tear up, women's tears spill onto the cheeks fasters while men's tears stay held in the ducts.

And why is EVERYONE claiming that men are less emotionally intelligent. The truth is that men are pretty good with each other. Usually men are able to regulate their emotions better than women. That's literally the definition of being emotionally intelligent. Men don't understand women's mood swings, but that's a whole different topic.

Yes, suicide rates are indeed higher in men, but maybe because stress is increasing in general. Maybe because we are living in concrete blocks rather than natural habitates? Maybe living in isolation and without the right to exercise our physical strength has a bad impact on the mental health?? Remember 1 lakh years ago when a monkey would give you stress and you'd immediately throw a giant rock at it. Or run away. Men's problems were always solvable through physical strength for the past 1 lakh years. But not anymore. Maybe that's the core reason behind the downfall of our mental health?

Moreoever, modern feminists claim that women are oppressed. They claim that women earn less money for the same job. You hinted this in your video, ""both should be paid equally"".
If that was true, won't just businesses hire women instead of men for the same job?
The truth is that women earn more per hour for the same job than men, that's why companies prefer hiring men.
Yes, business loose money due to paid maternity leave, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. If you hire a man, you get a better yield for the same salary, because you can put more burden on the man. And moreover most MNC's that try to flaunt gender equality in their teams, often hire less qualified women to enforce the sex ratio. How is that fair? It certainly does not seem like an ""equal opportunity"" when a more qualified person was denied the job due to gender-based quotas. Same goes for entrance in IITs now a days. This is the effect of feminism movements only, right?

And why do you keep saying that men don't want women to have equal rights? When they already got equal rights.
Seriously, Where are we lacking?

If you say that in this remote village, women are not allowed in this specific temple then I'll say come on man! Focus on metro cities once. Women have more rights than men already. Any woman can put any allegation on any man and the man gets beaten up by the mob or the police. I know you want to empower those oppressed women in the villages, but what about the oppressed men in the cities? Where do we go? Any woman can file for a false dowry case, false domestic violence case, and basically extort money from the man.

Also, the BIG difference between we joking about saying this guy has another girlfriend, vs a woman having an extra boy friend, the main difference is that for a woman it is really easy to have an affair. Because men have a very low bar to find a woman attractive enough to impregnate her.  So, every woman (no matter good looking or not, no matter single or married) will always be continuously approached by some men (single or married) who find her attractive at that point of time. And she can easily have an affair and get pregnant. Whereas the equations is very different for men. A normal man (who is not among top 2% tall +charming men) has to work extremely hard to impress just one woman in his life. And if the love of his life cheats, this man is completely devastated. This is the core difference. And average woman can very easily make one boy fall in love with her, and then completely destroy him by easily having another affair, and never stop, keep going on a spree, destroying hearts. And an average man has to do a massive amount of hard work to make one woman fall in love with him. I hope it is now clear to you why we laugh at a guy with 2 gf, and frown upon a girl who has 2 bfs. It has nothing to do with patriarchal thinking, it is just basic biology. THIS IS NOT HYPOCRISY! This will only become equal when men start giving birth to kids. 

Speaking of which, you misunderstood Mrs Neena Gupta. She said that since our biologies are different, the hormones that control our emotions are so different, it is natural to observe differences in the jobs preferred by men and women. You missed that point. I hope you look back at this video once you are more matured and come to the conclusion that this video is nothing less than another propaganda."
"Dhuv vai I agreed all of your points, but u just gave example of Hindu Garura Purana. Where exteme Alpha male philosophy exist in Peaceful Community's Holly Books. R you afraid to talk Against Islam and Their Holly Books? Is this equality brother? One woman cheated a loyal man and play victim card to get another BF easily,,It's a common thing but for boys who are cheated don’t get any girls.. Nowadays, Nobody is Shree Ram and No Women's are Mata Sita. That's the dark reality of this so called modren society. 🙂🖤"
"Talking about mens rights, you should also talk about the cases where a woman makes false allegations against a boy for a rape case, and the man loses his repuation , he is kicked out of his job and many men commit suicide. I liked your video alot, it is very important for people to know about the true meaning of feminism, you highlighted that many men dont know the true meaning of feminism, but along with this many woman also interpret feminism in wrong way like that zomato boy incident. I just have some constructive criticism for you about your  animal review , it is fine , good message, but in the past you have talked and promoted many many more violent and patriarchial movies and tv shows like gangs of wasseypur and breaking bad, money heist. Apart from this i am fan of your scientific videos..."

Seriously these words are eating this society feminine masculine same equality win loss.seriously bro divorce rate is getting higher day by day.
Even in this video you made men the culprit... seriously we men will never support ourselves!
"Male and female are not equal in both mentally, emotionally and physically. So, rights for both also should not be equal. Off course powers are also not same. I am not saying that female are lower them men. I mean these both genders have different powers. When these two gender meets, become superpower. Not equal, not dominated"

"Before watching your video i was a critic of faminism. but now i got the true sense of this word faminism and the difference between faminism and matriarcy. indeed women deserve equal rights and society should also admire man's feelings.

"Ladko ko feminism ka matalab samjhne se pahle jarurat hai ki ladkiya khud samjhe ki feminism ka matlab kya hai

Inke according chote kapde pahnna daru peena cigrate peena yahi feminism hai kyuki inko yahi lagta hai ki ladke bhi aisa करते hai to equality ke liye hume bhi karna chahiye
No doubt drinking and smoking bad habits hai to wo sabke liye hai na 
Aapne bahut aasani se male issue ko feminism se jod diya

Kitni fake dorry cases kiye jate hai ladko par false rep cases kiye jate hai ladki ke ek jhuthe stattment se ladke ki puri life barbaad ho jati hai 
Kyuki law is तरह से ही बिना है जिसके अनुसार लड़की सिर्फ बोल दे इसने बदतमीजी की बाकी अब लड़के को साबित करना है की मैने नही की।

So should we pay employees based on how important they are?
If we should, are we?"

"Dhruv in your video you only mentioned feminists of the past. In the past feminism was a positive movement, however modern day feminism is nothing compared to its former self. Also, those who demanded a ban on Cassie Jaye's Red Pill documentary are also modern day feminists. I love and admire feminists like Cassie Jaye and shall always support them but most of the feminits are not like her. Most modern feminists are toxic wokes who only want their side to be heard any dissent to their ideas shunned."

"Thank you very much, Dhruv Rathee! I fully support addressing the challenges that men encounter. However, attempting to undermine feminism by citing isolated negative instances has always been a concern of mine. I appreciate you addressing this issue thoroughly in the video."
finally someone talking about feminism and what it is in actually
अबे इंडिया मैं तो औरतो को आदमियो से ज्यादा अधिकार है जिसका वो गलत फायदा उठाती है
"I have a different opinion on this particular topic.

When we talk about any term implementation in our society we should look the conditions, situations facing societies who are adopting that particular culture.

Men and women both are equal in terms of having rights as a civilian, as a child, as a sibling, as individual human being living in any country. But at the same time when they constitute a family then they become responsible for certain things. Individually they both should have equal rights. But when it comes to form a new family then they both adopt specific designation.

Marriage is a constitution. 

When a man gets married nature demands from him to provide for his wife and child. Why?? I tell you later. But at the same time, when a woman gets married nature demands from her to make home. Be there for her child, be there for home, be there when her husband returns home tired. Be there to cook or provide healthy food via any cook or by her own. Be there to  maintain home, and more precisely for her child. Child demands mother love by nature. 

Do you remember? When we had returned from school in our old school days we always hunted ""where is mom? Where she's gone?"" Because we too wanted that mother should be there for us.

Women by nature is more into patience when it comes to bear the tantrums of children. Women are good enough in nurturing and upbringing of kids by God. Women are good in managing things precisely and keenly.

Men on the contrary, are good in leading home. They have leadership qualities. They are strong enough in case they lost their jobs, they can work hard physically to earn in any catastrophic conditions. That's why God has given them power and strong head. They could be patient but not more than a women in case of facing child tantrums. They supposingly give children time but not able to sit all day at home to nurture kids and bear their emotions. Men are not made in this way.

This all what I said above is general wordics, I'm not targeting any specific situation. 


Now imagine, how would it look like when both man and woman started doing jobs. I'm talking about average 9 to 5 job. Not above any business thingy, not talking about working hard in sites. Just an average office job or 9 to 5 any job. 

When both father and mother are absent for certain amount of time from home who would take care of child?? Grandma?? Baby sitter?? How long!? Let's suppose you both man and woman are making hell lots of money and somehow able to pay for cook(chef), home cleaner, for cleaning cloths, for baby sitter, bills, schooling of kids and what not. In this regard, you can just run the home, you can say (bachy pall rahy hain, lekin tarbiyt ni ho rahi) children lack mind relief and more into mental illness due to absence of parents counselling role in their lives, and could not get benefits from home making,eventually both will think where they'd put thereselves into. This is very hectic and busy routine.

9 to 5 is very hectic, a woman returns from work and instead of relaxing she have to take care of child what they ate? What they did whole day? What they all have to eat in dinner and at night both partners have to give time to eachother too. Man can cook, can do laundry, can treat kids but not in the manner what a woman can do. 

In america, where feminism movement started everyone now know whats the ground reality is, so they are not interested in marriage constitution any more. A large number of people have directed their minds into bf/gf culture or living in relationships. Where both gets benefits from each others physically but not into having family any more. Woman have to suffer a lot. She has to deal with her own health monthly with good amount of mood swings in addition to having pregnancy and pain during it. While giving birth she has to go through alot, and after that she has to be their for child for a good amount of time till the baby sitter thing.
This all brought them into not having family.

Japan and korea are good example of working of both genders. They're not interested in planning to have a family of their own . Family demands responsibility. And no one have enough time to take responsibilities other than work. They're working because they have to survive, and their sexual needs are already been meet. So what's the point of getting married and having child?? Their women have 0 birthrate expected in 2022. Pathetic.
There are unemployment because if both genders are working then there will be less opportunities for men to be able to run a whole family. That is why it is becoming a need to work both husbands and wives. And eventually time is near when they both will be no more interested in having a family.

So the conclusion is that, working of both genders leads to fall of marriage constitution. So if a man earns and provides for his family he demands respect in a positive manner because he's the one who remains out of the house in any season or condition to be able to provide. And woman should be respected because no matter what she's dealing with she's there for her child and husband to give them a good environment of home and care with love and kindness."
"Jab koi ladki kisi ladke ke sath galat karti hai to feminist support nahi karti ye bat hi nahi hai baat ye hai ki wo kabhi us ladki ke against nahi bolti jisne galti ki hai aur stand nahi leti

So basically..neither animal nor four more shots..noone should be seen an ideal film..both of them should be criticised equally.."

"Dhruv bhai 70% organs same hai but 30% organs hi to difference le k ayega na bhai. 
30% organs ne hi female ko pregnancy ka right diya hai jis k chakkar me unko caree se compromise krna rehta hai and then yahi sab unko house wife ban jane k liye influence krta hai jis se unki soch men’s k comparison me jyada vast nahi ho pati. 

with due respect to all women"
Ur videos are❤❤❤❤
That's why society have to be educated and aware
You have made good effort to put forth a genuine point. I think for some of your videos like this you can also discuss these points with related experts to make it more interesting and representing a wider opinion.
Will like to also remind you about the first Indian lady doctor Dr Kadambini Ganguly and her struggle to learn in medical school and to practise Medicine !
Tell me any right that is granted to men but not women so what are these rights that feminists are fighting for you have covered acid attack on women but not fake rape on men

"It's hypocritical to see how we readily identify cultures that oppress women the most, such as in Taliban-controlled regions or Saudi Arabia, where women are forbidden from driving. Yet, Dhruv only seems to highlight articles referencing Hindu scriptures, showcasing female warriors like Laxmi Bai and philosophers. This bias is glaring. Dhruv, I consider myself a centrist, but it's crucial to present realities in your videos without veering into soft manipulation or showing favoritism towards specific cultural groups.

NO HATE, JUST A THOUGHT!"

"I totally respect and believe in Feminism which stands for equal rights for men and women.

But it has achieved what it said out to achieve…
Although there’s still work left in the rural parts of India where women are not aware of their own rights

But feminism is usually abused by women who live in the cities
Where there already exercise all the equal rights and freedom.

In Indian this above feminism is definitely required…

But there toxic feminism as well which you can clearly see is destroying America if you follow it American channels

1. The comment section with Brett Cooper 
2. Jordon peterson

Are really good channels to see the craziness that is happening in The name of feminism 

The woke agenda which is currently destroying America right now.

This same thing can happen to us as well if we don’t learn from US’ mistakes"

"While discussing issues of gender equality, it's important to address both sides of the spectrum. Toxic feminism, just like any form of extremism, can hinder progress and understanding. It's crucial to have balanced conversations that acknowledge all perspectives and strive for genuine equality. It seems like the individual in the video just tried to shift the focus to male control over women without addressing the complexities of toxic feminism.."
Amazing content ❤
Obviously we need to respect a woman but we can't change the fact that god has made us stronger than women and we both need each other equally but there are some points where men are needed than women because we are made like that and yes there are also some points where we need women rather than men
Sir you are absolutely right. The work you are doing is uncomporable . I believe that awareness about this topic is very less in society . I hope you continue your work. I as teenager really learn a lot from your videos. I have learnt about rational thinking from you only . So thankyou verymuch.❤

Thanks to his mom for making him this way 😇who else agree😊
Chotiyeaaa men don't cry not boys
Dhruv you didn't even touch the toxicity of feminism... Just because you got a nice girlfriend..... Doesn't mean everyone is surrounded by nice girls 😂😂
You really taught what real Feninism is! 🙌👏👏👏👏
Our sisters have same rights in my home❤
I think dhruv U didn't touch the main topic why ppl are going away from Feminism. That is the new trend of toxic feminism which distraughts real feminism

"Perfection! Perfectly explained what actual Feminism is, tapped on importants points! Everyone must watch this video till the end !
Feminism simply put, equal rights for women just like men, doesn't mean men should be low-graded!
And about the point where men has smaller height or men earns less, they are regarded as ""Not Real Men"" dam, how should I say it? But I'm also part of that same mindset. lol 😂
Come on guys, I mean, It's just not acceptable for me, we gotta have bigger height or at least same. and We should earn more or at least same!
Am I wrong for thinking like this? My logical mind says I'm wrong, but my life say it's right. What's the truth? Truth is live in blissful ignorance.
Can't say more but just laugh out loud 😂😂"
Kabhi me dhriv rathee ka biggest supporter hua karta tha ab bhi support karta hu but video dekh ke bura laga dirty feminism ko bhadava nahi dena chahiye galat baat hai 😔
bhai sahi bt ha naaaa mard ka kam hota ha behr jana pase kamana or aurat ka kam hota ha ghr pa rehna or ghr k kam krna
"This is very interesting topic, by feminism women think and prefer and ask for equality in positions of power, that is politics or possibly any such position, but doesn't equality mean equality at all levels? Would such a feminist woman choose a job of a scavenger? or bricklayer? or construction worker? i.e. a job that involves lot of hard work physically. if the answer is no then such women are not actually looking for equality but are looking for position of power under shelter of feminism. have a look at what Jordon Peterson has to say on this. it's wonderful discussion and how he has torn apart this so called fake feminist women seeding mass women with wrong idea about being a feminist."

"Brother, I agree with you, but just look at the time, the number of people who got sexually aroused started doing mujra and getting naked on the internet."
"Putting men and women under the same banner of exploitation in a patriarchal society is dangerous. If someone says that the patriarchal system makes living difficult for men too, one must remember that it makes it worse for women. The level of freedom a man enjoys is far more superior than a woman. Moreover, when advocating for equality, one must always remember the biological differences between man and woman. A woman goes through a menstrual cycle every month and this period is extremely exhaustive both physically and mentally. Also a man cannot be pregnant. As such there cannot be equal treatment of men and women. A woman has to be given some concession on this ground. Also due to the fact that women are poorly represented (having less power)  in every aspect of life in a patriarchal society, they have to be given more rights sometimes over men, for instance, some specific laws in IPC which are deliberately made women centric."
❤
"I appreciate it soo much .Each and every point u have described is soo accurate ✨.The actual problem is the  toxic social media ,These PPL have  destroyed our  humanity ,moral values our mindset literally everything by relating ,by hypocrisy,by controversies and what not ! As a girl ,I can literally understand the problems of men as I hve brothers too by this patriarchy. we can't generalize everything to specific gender .Take example of loyalty,PPL usually blame all girls for not being loyal to their partners ,These chapris generalized all women for not being loyal ! And also some women blamed all men for being lusty .But a man can also  b disloyal too..and a woman can b lusty too .! Think as a human 🤌✨"
Please make video on board exam 2024 .  Copy kesse behtar likhe. I am student of 12 board. Please dhruv bhaiya.
"Women often talk about men having all the power, money, and control, oppressing women. However, it is important to note that this perception confuses a small percentage of wealthy men with the majority of men who struggle. Most men have no money, no power, no sex from their wife, and face difficulties in court battles, even losing their homes and the chance to see their children. Their lives are challenging.
The truth is -
~When a man earns he takes the responsibilities of family. When an women earns she becomes independent.
~When a man earns he may pick a no-earning women and makes her life-partner. When a woman earns she reject a men.
~A strong man can pick broken women and make her life strong. Strong women don’t look after broken men."
Toxic feminism p video bana ra h bolke mardo ko daat dia ir sikha dia😔 ladkiyo ko bhi daat do thoda😢
"Actually from my side Feminism varies from Person to person What kind of nature he/she is .. Some accepts it for everyone goods,somes doesn't.. it's not about dominance else Patriarchy 🙏🤝if you good matured enough Takes decisions wisely,you standalone Can do Anything you,no needs of Permission 🤝"

Bhai Dhruv tere 3bal beard white ho Gaye Hai
In Noida video if boy had beaten the girl he feminist would be screaming but as it was opposite there were none and probably girl wouldn't even got scratched for that. If you want equal rights then laws should be equal if a man hits woman or a woman hits man.

When you say nature don’t make hierarchy in gender then how animals have hierarchy in gender. I do support feminism but why don’t any feminist protest to work in construction site why they just want high paying jobs. Neo-Feminism has destroyed western society. Western man are now moving to South east Asia for what?
What about Indian laws??

"You know when people set their mindset they can twist any topic to their way of explaining. I am hundred percent sure if druve wanted to defend a criminal he can do it, (he will or not that's another topic)


I am giving you a recent example so that you can relate.

While the animal movie review he said it's affect on people mind set and whoever thinks like that way they get the validation when a hero does this toxic things.


But in this video he said feminist movie is not feminism, it doesn't showing original feminism, don't take it seriously.


If you think this movie don't showing original feminism then how can you judge animal or Kabir Singh movie basis on real masculinity. I can also say it also don't show original masculinity. (masculinity isn't beating or degrading women. Masculinity is providing and protecting women) 


If animal movie give validation to this kind of people's behavior then feminist movie also do the same thing.


It's ridiculous that when you don't like something you take small point and present it in massive way that, this is the reason why people mind are changing.

But when you sided with something you ignore the same point. It shows the partiality and biasness.

And I notice it quite some time. Though I like most of his videos because of logical point of view, research and information."
"_Sadly_
*100% Dhruv talked about* *Patriarchy*

Your education through men and women are equal is more than enough but the thing is that we were grew up in such environment that we use to treat women in low level comparing to men.. but I am feminist…👍
Equal rights is not a problem the main problem in Bangladesh is girls have more rights than man...  I Don't know what happens in India but in Bangladesh girls get more opportunity than man to shine in their carrier... If faminism means equality then why trains have a girl dibba why mans dont have any?
But the question is how these revolutionary campaigns over the past few dacades in West under the banner of Feminism has destroyed or heavily damaged the institution of Family 🤔
Point brother.. But kuch aurten hoti h jo equal right or women rights ka bht zyada galat use krti h

"Problem with feminism is it makes more father and less mother. When you have to take care of your babiesand feeding,you need female not male. But todays career oriented females are busy to compete with male coworker rather than take care of her family. And if father and mother both busy on working then total number of times to children decrease which caused todays addicted,rich chapri and weak generation just not having loves from parents. For feminist money is more inportant than their children. That is why we are watching news how children get out their parents from home beacause those children are unable to build connection with thier parents.
In feminism, their have no concept of modesty. How a modest woman can work with male coworker? Why is this male vs female? Why not female economic development with modesty rather than wanting same work that male are doing. Female should choose more work-from-home types work like crafting,online job,freelancing,clothing menufacturing etc. Amd one question: Why feminist think that household work is not a work? Are they don't respect every work?😂😂"

Really a great video Dhruv and I really believe that definition of feminism should be understand properly
"fact  : feminist are fighting for women favorable law in India. but what favorable law Men have in India I will give you guy's example: if men are raped by women,  men don't have any favorable law in India. but what if  women are raped by men  because in India women have favorable law in India."
"Men and women have differences. Due to these physical and emotional differences gender roles have been developed and due to these gender roles, humans have come to this era of development and prosperity. If there was no patriarchy, humans would have become extinct long ago. Since the world is at peace right now, these feminists movements have become widespread throughout the the world. But, if somehow an attacker with a gun breaks into the house, guess how will have to sacrifice his life to save his wife , or will the wife go to fight the attacker? Or if a war breaks out, who will be forced to fight ?MEN.
These feminist always say that men and women are equal, but when push comes to shove, it is Men who die in wars, work extreme jobs etc. Why don't they do it? 99% bricklayers are men, 90% mine workers are men. And they want equal pay when women don't even do these jobs that are the base of our civilization. They only want to work in the Air conditioned offices and want men as their slaves . ""EQUALITY""🤡"
Beautiful information ✨❤
Tell me 1 law that favor Men over women. There are none. Rather Women have many laws that favors them over Men. Is this what you call feminism. If no then Why are u not talking about them.

"So disappointed by this video of dhruv,you explained feminism in very good way but you covered very less about this pseudofeminism if most of the people relates feminism to these types of toxic feminists then it is a problem and you should have talked more about it, seems like you always appreciate good things but very less criticize bad things which is not good according to me."

Hatts off Dhruv bhaiyya. This is something that makes sense to watch something on internet.✨✨✨✨✨
I respect women alot i am a feminist they deserve equal right for sure 💯 but now u see in the current world the females are misusing them to a different level eg a man looks at a girl the girl goes and files the case man in jail now dont get me wrong there are many who are not like this but these types of issues are rising day by day and this is the reason why insta and social media is filled with this alpha male shit so to make this right all females and males should respect each other and the police and law should make rules and laws for both men and women equally and police should not treat women innocent in all cases btw mad respect to all the women out there who are honest with themselves and good at the end of the day god is going to make things right and punish the one at fault wether is a man or a woman

Feminism is everyone's natural instinct, antifeminism is learned. Also, there is a pseudo feminist group who discredits women by ""saving"" them. They're TERFs, Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist.  Neither They're radical, nor feminist. You could included that topoc too. Well if you make a second part, and please make one, you can include more intersectionality in feminism, thus explaining modern day feminist movement all over the world."

Thanks for this clear information ❤
Thank you Dhruv🙏 This is one of your most important videos!
I believe men and women both are equal overall but as a whole not identically. In some scenarios men are greater than women and in some women must be greater than men. This is beauty of life and family system. If you say both should be equal in all scenarios then it's never gonna settle this issue.

"Maybe the real reason is lack of awareness/understanding of feminism. Today I learnt that from you video. But I'd say that it won't be so simple to understanding as well. One need to be neutral to understand it. I always believed in equality, Today I know it's called feminism. My believe comes from my family and religion."

Men and women are NOT the same. But they are equal. Their biological needs and roles are different. But this should not affect their aspirations and freedom. Empathy is the main thing

If you think there is equality between male and female then search history who's are more creative and greater share in social environmental political warfare scientifical philosophyal and what ever so according to natur male are more competitive and strong while whoman are emotional and caring in nature faminesam is obviously not the right medium for both (for example) conduct a marathon race take male and female collectively and guess who will win if you get your answer the mandatory reply me with your precpactiv I will appreciate it thanks

"I am so glad I saw this video..I have seen videos on “Toxic Feminism” and was expecting something on similar lines..but this is totally different and is extremely informative..I will surely send this video to many in my family and friends because people actually often confuse “Feminism” with “Matriarchy” and consider patriarchal practices as normal.

I would like to thank you Dhruv from the core of my heart for bringing up such topics and making such great content.

All the best for your next video..
More power to you!!!"

society works as a team like in football ball every one needs to perform in their position defender cannot protest to get right to play forward and an forward cannot say i want to play back the only justice that can be done is when the team wins the trophy belongs to all"
Momina Quit this video 😅😅
equalist bno.. feminist nhiii///
In india women have more rights then men where is equality?
"The word ""feminism"" comes from the Latin word femina, which means ""woman"". The word ""feminism"" is a combination of the Latin word fēmina and the suffix ""-ism"". The suffix ""-isme"" comes from the Latin word –ismus, which turns a noun into a practice, system, or doctrine.

Just asking, we already had the word equality, so why this word was even needed?"

👏👏
"This video by Dhruv Rathee challenges the idea that feminism is about men vs. women, instead arguing it's about smashing harmful gender roles that limit everyone. It explores how both men and women suffer under patriarchal expectations, and showcases real feminist heroes who fought for equality for all"
The best example for this topic is vibhuti Narayan Mishra 😂😆
Feminism is equality of opportunity but not equality of outcome.

"Video is partially informative and mostly manipulative.. I mean why didn't you talk about high valued men.. You told chapri people are spreading hate, but didn't talk about how large number of girls talk about feminism but keep 10 boyfriends.. U didn't talk about the one sided family laws of the country.. There was lot to discuss but you took only a small segment of men and tried to prove that in every situation men are wrong.."

"In starting u have said u are making video on toxic feminism. Everyone knows the meaning of feminism. Toxic feminism itself means that the defination of feminism is taking in wrong way. And u haven't said anything about that toxic feminism actions done by modern women ,only justifying the wrong activity by saying ki aadmi bhi aise harkate karte hai. Your whole video is 100 percent right in every word but this video is not about the toxic feminism."

"I could not understand whether he talked about feminism or patriarchy in his video, I think he deviated from his topic in this video. The title should not match with the content on which he talked about in his video. He mixed up all the terms together and highlighted patriarchy more than feminism."

Dhruv bhai i love your videos but we were expecting a video on matriachal films masked as feminist movie so basically fake feminist movies like barbie nd all.. thats wht we want
sadly social media feminists are against men......most feminist pages hate men for being men....so the idea is not the problem the people who are carring along with them are the problem

"Exponentionally Great Work.
Still I Would Say.
In This Whole Video Only -Mens Were Targeted.
-Very Least Talk About Toxic Feminism.

1 . At 22:25 (Neha Dhupia Case).
As Dhruv Said No Feminist Supported Neha ,
But Also Mostly Feminist Never Criticized Neha.

2. 22:40 We See Mostly People Including Feminist Criticized This,
But Just Imagine If Same Would Have Happen Vice Versa. The Man Would Have Got Lott More Hatred.

If We See Feminism As A Equality Tool For Both Men & Women .
Then I Must Say I Support Feminism 
But The Definition The Feminist People Have Created Are One Sided .
Same Like This Video .

There Are Many Things About Toxic Feminism ,
but This Topic Was Left Behind & Only Men Were Being Criticized.

We Know Our Society Is a Patriarchal Society,
Just Because The Culture We Have Developed Is From Thousands of Years & We Can't Change This in Short Span.
But There Is Lott Of Improvement .

Just Some Of you Got Good Education & Awareness ,
Doesn't Mean We Are Dumb. Surely We Have Less Knowledge About Things.
But The Educated People Degrading Lower Educated More Intensely"

"Women are equal to men ? Lets learn the truth 

1.Our bodies are different (structurally). That's not a false statement. That's just nature. There are differences in body 
2. Our strengths are different. That's why there is no wrestling/ufc/any other sports between men and women.(still it's bound to equality between women not men and women). Train a man and women for same time and lets see who will win.
3. If male and female were equal then why is there no general one quota for men and women in competitive exams. There is literally 50:50 ratio of boy:girl seats in that.... That's not equality... equality was when you just made one general quota where boy and girl compete for same seat. Take example of Cutoff of NEET in normal state of India.
4. Laws of constitution gives all the best rights to Female in marriage( even if women is wrong male still has to pay even after divorse) wtf
5. Remember when someone talks about equality between men and women = feminism It's bullshit.
6. Women are best in their own ways....A man cannot imagine a life without women... That's mind of every men out there....
There is always one girl(after mom) for which a man can giveup his life

Remember when it's a video about feminism...It is just one more way to make a man  ""g@y"".... that's how ""so called modern countries are now a days."""

brother can you plz make a video on pakistani current affiars and rigged elections going on in pakistan we all are waiting for your video really love your information
"I don’t agree with you 
Men and women are not equal just like in every species males and females have different ability for example a female athlete can never compete with an equal size opponent in race, boxing, or take any sport and about the brain how many inventions do women have 1 or 2 most of the inventions and innovations are done by men to this day then how can we say they are just equal no are they great in business how many women billionaires are there without divorced money or heritage money very few (ok India is not good at giving equal opportunity to women but what about the western countries) how many successful women entrepreneurs are there . Then in what sense can we say they are just as capable as men it’s just dumb . If tomorrow Somalia (an African country) claims they are as equal, powerful and capable as USA would you just accept obviously not they have to prove it  so women given the time has barely proved anything but god gave women some abilities which a man cannot do as better as women like taking care of people, managing households, other caring jobs that why you see more female nurses than male because it suits their personality"
"Pehle sirf ladkon per pressure tha employment ka... ab ladkiyon per bhi hona chahiye kya, kya yehi equality hai? I'm sure that's not the narrative here from feminism. But that will be the end result. That's because regardless of the gender, education, culture, the world always had a majority of innocent and gullible people falling for a propaganda or some other narrative. Majority people will not learn the definition you provided for feminism. They will have their own interpretations, (perhaps guided by their inner devil or by greater good). That's why you see people talk more about women empowerment rather than men empowerment, you see more and more laws being prepared and passed in favor of women. If one side is making their own interpretations, there's another side taking advantage of this narrative. And the example I provided at the start is only one small case. The world was always a hostile place for humans, and men took the onus, or were told, to safeguard their women. As a counter argument, can you say why didn't were women told to protect men? All these arguments are for sure not part of that narrative, but that's what people will end up with. So, what's the best way out? Well, it's a complex world. Perhaps one lifetime isn't enough to know everything. If you're like Dhruv, you're in a better position to learn more and more about all the complexity that exists, but even still you'll never be able to honestly conclude anything precise on all that. Even with all sides being wise, the flow of arguments and counter arguments will never end. Perhaps that's why there's something called religion. Peace."
Good one

Brother thank you ❤
Beautifully explained!🎉
"First of all, there is a difference between rights and recognition. Women in today s world do have more rights (speaking in a Western region context). Countries such as Canada, US, NZ, AU, have more rights for women comparatively. It is also a fact that men and women are NOT THE SAME AND WILL NEVER BE THE SAME because of the concept of their creation. (i.e. Adam was created before Eve, and Eve was created to provide comfort and company to Adam). Because woman is the gender responsible for carrying a future generation, these countries recognize their rights and de facto rights were given to the mother (as long as the mother is proven to provide good care). So it is proven that literate society with intellectual understanding do consider human rights when it comes to women.

The argument now is on the equality basis. So all I can say is that men are not privileged and have to face the same kind of obstacles as women when it comes to leadership positions in society with respect to social, political, and ethical culture. One must prove themselves with determination. 

In my personal opinion, men and women are physically different, but psychologically, intellectually, and aesthetically are very much capable of standing equally right next to men. The differentiation point is the mindset of making a choice.  ""Normative Conformity""  is not being imposed on someone, yet it's that individual's choice to have the need to fit-in and that's not a societal issue. I consider it a personal issue. Issue that one does not have enough confidence to stand up for him or her self, issue that one is waiting for the society to make choices for him or herself. these are the issue in today's world where all the ""so-called Feminists"" are rising up and voicing out ridiculous concerns about women not having basic human rights. The narrative is so convoluted that women today are not abusing it and turning a legitimate concept into bullying men. Before even talking about Women are not have equal rights in today's world we should add more context to which region are talking about, analyze whether its a women's rights issue or human rights issue (which includes similar issues for men), and whether that region has judicial regulation to safe guard these human rights. if all the answers are YES, and still there are issues, than that's the criminal offense instead of just ""women equality""."
What a damn great video

"One question - why almost all women prefer tall guys? 
Is it because society teaches them that or is it because biological factor?
If you are going to say that men and women are quite then please talk about biological factors, million years of evolution, hormones, biological needs( while won't go away so easily) 
Yes men and women must have equal rights but we can't change the fact men biologically want certain things in their partner and same goes with women."
"Dhruv I have seen feminist who do laugh when men cry, who did support Neha dhupia and even Lucknow girl slapping the boy but unfortunately people like you will never point them out because as per you a girl can never be wrong"
"Mr. Dhruv apne patriarchy aur feminism ko explain achche se kiya
Lekin apko nhi lgta ki har kam krne me admi aurat equal nhi ho skte
Jaise kahi earthquake aa gya, flood, bridge toot gya yaha rescue operation admi krte hai kyunki physical strength wala kam hai admi jaldi krege ab yaha equality krne ka mtlb dusre ki zindagi khatre me dalna
Duniya me 50% kam physical strength wala hota hai waha aurat admi me chah kr ke bhi equality nhi ho payegi 
Crime against women bhi sirf aur sirf isi physical strength ka jo frk hai usi wjh se hai bolna easy hai admi aurat barabar hote hai lekin dono me  sharirik takat ka frk hi bada difference hai equal n ho pane ka"

"Men will marry any type of women weather settled or not.but,Women will always prefer to marry a rich, well secured man. Even if women is secured or unsecured she will only marry a settled man only. That is the pressure on men's. When time comes even feminists will also turn and start arguing that weather women earn or not, men should earn.
Women satisfies a men or not they should be together. but, if men not satisfies a girl they can't live together. 😂😂"

In fact, I would say he is one of the most valuable youtubers I watch because everytime I watch his videos, it sure does leave a mark in me.

"Dude. That neena gupta clip is totally out of context. She meant to say “similar” if you see the whole episode. People tend to use words like same equal and similar interchangeably.

She was narrating an incident where she said someone was following her continuously because of which she had to miss a flight, until she took a male friend with her to drop her at the airport. 

And I totally think that she is right!  Living in this society is easier for men than women. of course men have their own difficulties but always look at the ratio.

Coming back to your video I agree with like 90% of your video where you speak data and not opinion!

Love your work ☀️ but might not agree to certain segments of it."
"Dhruv bro

Equal opportunity and support in social environment will be required that agree.


Two queries
1) why the laws are missused by Female and men's are helpless in recent times starting with Jasleen kaur case?

2) Instead of equality when they live together equity will be required after understanding eachother weakness.Then only both can live together or else instead of living happily will live stressful. Isn't that right?"
Thank you so much for this! ❤
We should support feminism but not pseudo feminism ❤🇮🇳
"Any other person would probably ignore these RW illiterate morons, but Dhruv decided to teach them in an educated way. Kudos to you man 👏🏼. These chapris who call themselves alpha are 40-45 kg, 5ft tall lowlife stupids in real life who has no say even in their own family 🤣🤣🤣"
Modern feminism is no longer what it used to be. Specially in west. It has become more and more radical where abortion is considered women empowerment instead of health issue. And women are taught to compete with men even if they choose to go to different path.

Absolutely correct you are Dhruv Ji ☑️
bhai ladkiyan khud hi bolty hain hum kamzoor hai... 😂😂😂 😅
"Like to add a few points. I guess you missed another feminist name. Mr. Naseeruddin Shah. Regarding the movie Thappad the problem is not limited to slapping, but the husband being unapologetic about his wrong action. She waited long with expectation of regret from her husband which actually didn't happened, rather he along with all family members and freinds  normalizing the action. And the last point is about act of Neha Dhupia keeping there is not much difference between supporting and keeping mum. all Feminists should speak out against such toxic things else the whole message will be getting lost."
"When you talk about feminism, you should talk about women showing atrocities on men with lesser social status. Or we have to coin a different word, ‘ Menism’ for that"
"I boycott sex , marriage and girlfriend😊😊😊"
"The video was supposed to be about toxic faminist but the video is although about different topic.

"No doubt men and women are different, not only physically but psychologically also. Nature has given both men and women some biological functions which are different from each other.  But, this does not mean being men is superior or vice-versa. We (as humans) must embrace our masculine and feminine qualities and also understand each other's feelings."
The word he said are only on papers and internet. None of them think really about feminism. It's always her choice.
Feminism might be good for everything else but not for marriage.

Thenks dhuruv sir good explanation
"Superb video.. I just found one fault/message not properly conveyed... You said that many male dont want equal rights or oppose feminism... But its also true that many men also have patriarchal mindset like women because they have seen such things from their childhood. 
They are wrong but its not intentional... They are just unaware, and what helps to solve problems like these are such videos.. So thankyou for this video!!! 😊"
Im not against girls affair ... Just give me chance too ... 😂 kidding
Like it’s said only Women Babies and Dogs are loved unconditionally but men will be loved only if they are a provider…
"Another thing i want to add, why do we relate movies like veerey di wedding and four more shots to feminism and women empowerment? Why can’t we just see those movies like a normal movie that revolves around the lives of four women without bringing any political agenda in between? Why do we watch movies where men are casually drinking, smoking and hooking up without being offended (it doesn’t even come to our notice) but god forbid if a woman does the same, then we all say “yeh hai tumhara feminism”. Why do we attack feminism whenever a girl puts false allegations on a guy? How does feminism gets in the way whenever a woman fucks up? The only reason behind all this is that we hate feminism for no reason and will never fail to shit on it whenever a woman does something wrong which is in NO WAY related to feminism. I will watch a video titled how some women can misuse the law, i will never watch a video titled how fake feminists put false accusations because it’s clearly an agenda of the anti-feminists!"

Wow yar thank you for clearing my thoughts about feminism
"I was expecting one more issue you could have raised -About the fact that how easily a women can put harrashment cases on boys here it is almost a threat that is common in here in UP where the girl just instantly say that she will accuse the boy for seksual harashment 
GOOD and informative video as always"
We want feminism but not that feminism.what Bollywood & hi class socity think
Is video se ek hi chij samajh aaya ki faminism jaise bimaari ki jad kitani gahri hai aur dusari baat ki faminism ke side   effect ke  baare me dhruw raathi  jaise logo ko bhi sirf 5% hi  jaankari ho sakti hai
"Feminist ne ye nahi kaha ki Neha Dhupia ne jo kaha wo sahi kaha par ye bhi to nahi bole wo log ki usne jo kaha wo galat hai. 
Same cheez mard se hoti hai tab hi feminist bolte hai par female se hone ke baad chup rehte hai."

"Obviously feminism and men and women having equal rights is really important but you can't just ignore the ""modern feminism"" so many young girls are following which is obviously destructive to the society as well as the relationship between men and women. 
Yes patriarchy oppressed women for so many years but that doesn't mean now it's time that men of this generation have to suffer. 
For example everyone says ""teach your son to respect women"" when it should be "" teach your children to respect others irrespective of their gender""
I wish dhruv would have talked more about how ""modern feminism"" is destroying our country just like it did to western countries. 
Men need to suffer in the name of equality and feminist is not the right way to achieve the goal."

"There are no feminist in a house fire or in a hijack situation then everyone wants the safety of women and children first -

Real world work like this equality is good in hearing and thinking but doesn’t work practically due to physical capabilities and morals .

In some things women are better in some things men are better this argument shouldn’t even arise its mere common sense 😵‍💫"

Dhruv are you a Feminist
"Being a long time viewer of your channel, I think this will be one of the very few videos where I think you didn't put out the whole picture about the voting issue.
Men got the right to vote before women because men were subject to military conscription. If you elected a representative to represent you in the government, that representative could then vote to send you to war. Men, being the exclusive victims of forced military conscription, were perceived to have more of a say and a right. But this privilege also came with corresponding responsibilities, such as the obligation to serve in the military and potentially sacrifice their lives on the battlefield. That's how men gained the right to vote before women did.
And I don't think a single woman would come forward today to die on the battlefield, if there's a World War III."
you know what....this video was more about patriarchal😅But the real problem is....todays some modern feminist are asking extra rights instead of equal rights.
All clear thanks bro❤
"Same things same points that I know were said, but I expected him to talk more about how the laws in India made for women to protect them are misused and also how some section of women also promote these actions such as smoking drinking slapping and it's her choice thing as a feminist ideology but again it's common trend to blame men. I can also say it's patriarchal atitude to believe and say that only men associate the things which do not log belong to feminism. Why I am even typing no body in YouTube anymore types serious comments. I have gone to atleast three stages of life. My early days in 2018-2020 where i was far left and believed everything he said. My 2020-2022 days when I didn't believed a single thing he said. And now I just see whole video then try to form my own opinions. So as I said, he himself says not to generalize but he did generalized in the end saying these alpha male won't understand that feminism is not this. I will also like to add that no feminist opposes or raise their voice for men who get beaten by women. I will also say thanks for this video it showed me one new thing that any normal human being is a feminist. So my question is if any normal human being is a feminist. So why we need labels like feminist? Why not call a normal human just a normal human. Not that I have anything against feminist but feminist word comes with a lot of meanings these days while no one knows it's true meaning. Or that being normal is not normal so you give them titles like feminist. Nah man I am realist. Sorry I yapped. In end I just want to live my life as a normal human being who iso loved by someone atleast. Damn. Terrible day for rain. That suicide part. I relate to it. Not that I will do it, but I relate to it. 3 people around me died due to suicide. I should join them"

"I'm surprised feminism is still a thing, men and women should have equal rights, they got equal rights, it's stupidly used still nowadays by women in scenarios that suits them and serve them, pseudo feminism is the problem, we see many such examples everyday, majority the women wants a guy who earns more than them, wants the guy to pay on the first date, and in many cases wants them to pay all the time. It's diabolical."

Feminism is not the opposite of patriarchy... matriarchy is .. to those who want to see what matriarchy is go watch margot robbies barbie.. in the movie the barbie world is run by women and men are just for show.. if u watch that movie u will realize the difference between Feminism and matriarchy.. women are uplifting themselves not bringing anyone down.. while patriarchy and matriarchy puts down the other gender to rise. Stop being scared of feminists they are just trying to lift oppressed women and challenge patriarchal people both men and women .. its not female vs male . Its about oppression vs patriarchy😢
"I agree that women who discriminate or disrespect men are not feminists. But majority urban young women now have such mindset, even if its not feminism, whatever this syndrome is called its affecting a lot of people and to just end the conversation by saying that 'oh it was wrong' is just that - wrong. 
What majority of young women now call 'feminism' is actually the corruption & unfairness of patriarchy but they see it as a privilege and source of empowerment. So both the narratives of alpha male & female needs to go but again this video feels like you wanted to justify the current 'feminism' but didnt as u know it'll be wrong."

You didn't mentioned Suedo Feminist where majority women tries to show themselves Superior then Mens
"Don't dislike our scriptures because of that. The scriptures say that because the emotions of Women most of the time cloud their intellect, someone in the family needed to be rational at that time. But society has misunderstood this message and treated women as lower than the man that is not right. However, the biological differences will always remain, so we need to re-establish the laws and make sure both genders are treated equally."

Nowadays 99% of the world believe in men and women equality . So there is no need to discuss this topic. More discussion on this topic leads to women getting undue advantages for being women in many spheres of life.
"@DruvRathi... Woman empowerment, patriarchy, matriacrhy, Lonelness, kuku fm....sab p gyan pel dia but.... Jo topic tha ""TOXIC FEMINISM"" uske bare m btaya hu ni..."
"Every rational and wise person supports feminism. Women should be given equal rights. It is ok to give equal rights and opportunities in education, job , sports etc. The issue arises when women start asking men to cook food and wash vessels. As a man I feel that we have been doing the harder things and evolved with different capabilities. For example if my job is to be a construction worker lifting heavy things, I cannot switch roles with my wife. She would rather feel safe and better to stay home and cook for the family.  Women are good at taking care of kids, men aren't. It isn't easy to switch roles and have equal duties for both in that case. Similarly there are many things which only men can do, but women aren't built to do and vice versa.  We need to understand our capabilities and roles and not keep cribbing about it. If there's a couple who work in a software company which doesn't involve any hard labour, then they can share the house chores equally. I would personally prefer my wife to be at home and take care of the kids and  household chores and cook good food for me when I am back from work, rather than both going out to work, having a maid to Cook for us and leaving kids in a daycare center. I think the majority of the women also would prefer the same coz that's an ideal scenario. The problem arises when the husband abuses his rights and suppresses his wife. That's when women feel the need to work and earn money to become independent."
Its not about feminism theory... its about what they present in the name of feminism
Maturity when your realise Dhruv is always beings right video on right time with Right Thoughts ❤

Equal rights and mutual respects for both genders.
"According to Upanishads -

To rise above the body and raise your consciousness is real feminism for men and women."
"@9:15 you talked about male female having 70% same body organs like eyes,nose,brain,internal organs but if you study biology you will find each of them are slightly different or smaller in female bodies compared to men........according to your logic dogs and human are same as both has same organs like eyes,nose,brain.  It's 100% sure that men are physically stronger, women are more emotional, men are hard, women are soft etc."
I think masculinity is inversely proportional to feminisms just think about it....
Faminism ✅✅ fake feminism ❌❌❌😌😌
Yes
Men and women can never be equal. Patriarchy is from very long times ago and it is better system than any other system.
The real word for equality is egalitarianism not feminism

Although when we don't find anyone supportive  petriyarchi gives men strength in tough time. 🙂"
"Video about feminists

Blames men for women being feminists"
"I disagree with everything in this video...
Why do we even need of two Genders? Why did not Homo Sapiens evolved into one gender? Wouldn't it be easier for us? At least there won't be any discrimination between Genders... 
It is not the problem if Female Genders become equal to Male Genders. The problem starts after they got equal, will they still want to co-exist with Male Genders as equals or will they try rise above Male Genders, usurp power and rule over them? If this is the case and after feminism, Female Genders create a matriarchal society then what makes it different from Patriarchy?
Either you rule or someone else will take your place...
Selling Feminism is like telling everyone that communism/capitalism/socialism theory is the right thinking, way of right path. Except it then the world will be a better place like ""God's Eden"". But we all can see what happens in real life implication."
Love you dhruv for the facts that you show us
Following this channel for the past year and this is definitely one of the best videos by the Dhruv Rathee Team. Much appreciate the efforts for shedding light on these topic in these times!

Isliye mene dhruv bhai ko subscribe kiya hua hai ❤
Men say women love to play victim ... no dude we just know how to express when we are being oppressed by patriarchy .. you guys have been told to suppress your emotions by the same patriarchy so u never raise questions because that system will tell u that u are less of a man...maturity is when we realize that both men and women are suffering because of patriarchy.
It's all lol
"The fact that you have put up everything in this video so intellectually 
I hope people watching this change their mindsets 
I as a female will stand for men's rights as strong as I'll stand for female's rights
It's not about male or female
It's about being a human & treating humans with humanity ❤
Thank you for this"
salute to you dhruv. You are a great man.
We start by making gender neutral laws in first place.... 😅
"Just think about it, ever since women were introduced to feminism, a strong generation could not be formed. Women have the potential to create a powerful generation, something men cannot achieve. Whatever tasks Allah has assigned to each, they are the best at it. If you take kidneys to perform the function of the heart, the body will collapse, similarly, the generation has collapsed due to the difficulty and impossibility of both parents working. Look at Ambani; there is no heir after him who can manage his empire. Why? Because Nita Ambani did not give time to the children.
Man tm jiske ideology k base pe baat kar rahe ho wo doobne wali hai ...."
Feminism is a good thing but ismein Jo ladkiyan Jo galat tarike se right ka use karti hai uske bare mein to batata bhai 😂
"Dhruv comparing social media trolls (men) with journalists. Totally ignoring the fact that such trolls also exist in women. Either compare social media toxic men and women or compare sensible men and women. Your arguments appear as if men don't want equal rights for women, while in reality there is negative sentiments in men due to toxic feminism"
"Ur some points are great but some are very stupid
As man I don't mind ki ladkiyo equal rights mile , me toh pt chahta hu sabko same mile jisse competition sahi rhe. Me chahta hu ladkia bhi enjoy kare life jese ladke krte h ."

I have noticed aaj bhi kitna bewakoof log yahan pr exist krte hai yeh whi sb hai jinko dhruv ne abhi chhapri alpha male bulaya hai 😂 sb offend hogye aur ab usspr blames daal rhe kaise insaan hai yaar kaise anpad ho tm jo yeh bhi ni smjh rhe ki yahan pr hindu muslim ki baat hi ni ho rhi aur naahi bjp ki lekin phr yeh log hate krne ke liye aa rhe baaton ko relate krne its that simple as that yahan pr baat social mudde ki ho rhi but yeh log phr bhi hate krenge and ek aur baat yeh hai ki yeh log dhruv ke channel pr kbhi direct comment ni krte.....kyu pta hai pdhe likhe log hai sb yahan pr bichare akele pdhh jayenge isliye doosron ke replies me bolte hai....shame on these illiterate ppl
Muslim females are the ones who are highly getting suppressed by patriarchy we should implement ucc soon for their sake of respect 😢
Indian toxic patriarchy😢
height agar same to ho kya problem?
"Hi dhruv bhaiya, it was a really great video and I loved the fact that you highlighted what actual feminism is and also the struggles of males due to patriarchy but there is still one doubt which lingers onto my mind is that just like how you criticised and told us about the toxic masculine culture I would also love to know something similar about the toxic feminism tho it's not something which can be compared with actual feminism just how toxic masculinity can't be compared to actual ideas of masculinity, but toxic feminism still remains there. There are many men out there who are subjected to fake harrassment cases, there are many toxic feminists who love to use there women card and also I have seen this circulating in western media that a lot of women out there have misinterpreted feminism and now they disregard men totally. At the end of the day I would like to say is I don't mean to generalise my views for everyone it's just as a 16 year old guy who has immense respect for women and men around him I would love to know the other end of the society of both the genders.
Thanks for reading till here😊"

"Mai to ye soch Raha hu India me to ladkiyo ko barabar rights mile hain, har jagah reservation bhi mil gaya hai, to ab konse barabar rights chahiye?😂 I think inko ab domestic inequality ke against laws chahiye. For example koi parent apni ladki ko raat me Ghar se bahar jaane se nahi rok sakta agar ladka bhi jaa raha hai to. 

Btw ladkiyo ke reservation se ek cheap harkat yaad aayi. Mai Delhi me rehta hu aur public transport bus se school jata tha, to maine ek didi ko notice Kiya hai (stalker nahi hu mai😂 aur wo didi kya insaan kehne layak bhi nahi hain) wo didi bhi mere hi time pe same destination tak jaati thi. Lekin wo hamesha reserved seat pe baithe males ko hata deti thi. Males ko hatana reserved seat se galat nahi hai but wo old citizens aur heavy bag carrying uncle ko bhi bata deti thi. Matlab reservation de di govt ne to insaaniyat hi nahi bachi hai kuch logo me."
"तू पढा लिखा होकर भी बेवकूफ है।  तभी एसी नपुंसको जैसी हरकते कर रहा है।
मूर्ख, जो प्रक्रती प्रदत है उससे बनी सोच वास्तविक होती है। और प्राकर्तिक रूप में मर्द ना सिर्फ शारीरिक बल्कि मानसिक रूप से भी औरत से बहुत अलग है। ये कोई हल्का अंतर नही बहुत बडा अंतर है। शारीरिक बल तो अंतर है ही बल्कि मानसिक रूप से भी बहुत अंतर है। क्योकि स्त्री पुरुष की अभिवृत्तियो और बहुत हद तक स्वभाव मे भी अंतर है। जिससे दोनो की कार्यप्रणाली मे भी प्रभाव होता है। काश तू दर्शन पढा होता तब तुझे पता होता। 
स्त्री पुरुष की भिन्न भिन्न प्रवत्तियो के आधार पर ही सदा से  सामजिक व्यवस्था चली आ रही है। ये व्यवस्थित रही क्योकि ये पूरी तरह लजिकल और दूरदर्शी थी। जो आज फेमिनिस्म जैसी काल्पनिक जबरदस्ती की सोच के कारण बर्बाद और तहस नहस हो रही है। जो तुम्हे दिखाई नही दे रहा क्या?
स्त्री पुरुष मे अंतर ना समझ पाना अपने आप मे जगत की सबसे बडी मूरखता है। 
रही बात पुरुष प्रधान समाज की तो वह हर जगह इसलिये था क्योकि प्राकर्तिक रूप से वृत्ति और स्वभाव ही एसा है मानव का। इसलिये कोई भी परिवार और समाज पुरुष प्रधान समाज से ही चल सकता है। जबर्दस्ती का फेमिनिस्म जैसा नाटक समाज और पारिवारिक सुव्यवस्था को खत्म कर पशु की भांति स्वच्छंदता ला देगा। जो आज देखने मे भी आने लगा है। इसलिये ये मूर्खो जैसी सोच मत रखो को स्त्री पुरुष समान है और उन्हे समान अधिकार व कार्य मिले। फेमिनिस्म का नाटक अप्राक्र्तीक ही है। भले ही कितना गाना गा लो।
आज जिन महिला अधिकारो की बात कर रहे हो वो किसके बल पर आखिर? मर्द के ही ना। अब तालिबान ईरान जैसे ही देशो मे देख लो जहा मर्द नही चाहते वहा अधिकार नही मिलते। कोशिश की गयी थी वहा भी महिलाओ द्वारा लेकिन क्या हुआ सब जानते है। तो आखिर मे इससे भी तो वही पुरुष प्रधान समाज सिद्ध हुआ ना। क्योकि ये प्रक्रती ही पुरुष प्रधान है। इसलिये ये सोच बिल्कुल सही है।"

Dhruv Rathee u should also watch this movie. trust me that movie is so ahead of that time which a homemaker, takes a job as a door-to-door saleswoman to meet the increasing financial pressure on her orthodox and conservative family, who share a cramped apartment. Despite the disapproval of her father-in-law, Priyogopal (Haren Chatterjee), the hesitant and nervous Arati soon begins to prosper in her field and gradually starts to enjoy her new-found financial and psychological independence."
Ngl this video should be eye opener to the society and specially to those uncle and aunties.
Nice sharing 👍❤❤🙏
"Gen X is suffering the most because of this transition.. Such changes  take time.. Its not like 1 video will studdenly change everthing.. Its gradually changes..

Most Men  are dogs for sure but some women wants to join us like a bitch but not being herself.. . This is equality for them.."
Faminism  ek janmjaat bimaari hai aur iska ek hi ilaaj hai jab  us aadmi  par faminism ke karan bane ektarfa  kanoon ka durupyog  karwaya jaye aur us purush aur uske pure pariwar ki jindagi barbaad ho jaye
Sach kehna chahti hun dhruv ji u r mindddd blowing👏👍
"Thank you for this video 🙏
This restores faith in humanity and men as well. I used to be a lot confused as a teenager, as I was in favour of what’s being said in this video but I was told that I’m rebellious and of course “feminist” (even though they meant misandry)"
How can someone hate this guy man. He's just telling the truth and spreading awareness to people. Take a bow

male incel feminists in the thread
I partly agree with this video.Well researched...
Feminism - इंसान होने का सबसे सुंदर रास्ता है । दुनिया को खूबसूरत बनाने की दवा है। इसी पृथ्वी पर स्वर्ग बनाने का मार्ग है।

"He showed that how men used to treat women and want patriotism and how men mislead actual feminism. But he didn't show how women taking the feminism at whole wrong level... You might have seen many videos in which women talking about how they don't need men, men are dogs, dogs can give birth to human so they don't need men, feminism means you can freely have only fans account, girl can slap a boy but boy can't.... There are whole many cases and incidents where women have used feminism in wrong way... But he didn't showed that sided.... That's what he did wrong 😪"

"Respectfully disagree when you said, ""Society ye kahti ka tou aurat ki kamai khata"". Instead, there are researchers that women themselves leave their husbands when they are consistently earning more. The definition of feminism you stated was accurate in the past first wave but now has completely changed in the West. Instead, it is totally about killing genuine masculinity instead of just toxic. Also, on 'Boys don't cry like that"" thing, feel free to research multiple girls asking them if they'd like hanging out or forming relationships with men who whinge and cry mostly, you'll get the answer surely. Apart from this, mostly agree with all the points shared. Brilliant video overall."
Thank you for making a video on this topic. It was much needed and you explained everything to the point. Huge respect for the efforts . And we need more men like you 😇
I'm 21M and I am a  Feminist

"Shwetabh has been doing this for months but did anyone noticed,obv not and the same people are telling in comments hats off to you ,you are the first one speaking,nah bro Already a lot of people have spoken on this,its just that you never ever researched on this topic,cuz you never really cared , you are watching this video just cuz dhruv made it , obv i appreciate him for this video , ki uski vajah se aur logo ko pata chalega , but kya jitne bhi logo ne ye video dekha hai aur vo aage sachme ispe research karenge, agar karege the i will be more than happy,i have problem with those jo ek din mai is topic ko bhul jaate hai video mai comment karne ko kar diya par apni taraf se bhi thodi reseach kar lena aur also for more information you can watch shwetabh videos ,deepika Narayan Bhardwaj has also started a petition for mens,i dont exactly Remember the name ,but you can get it from swetabh's community post and also dhruv bhaiya if you are reading this comment plz aapp bhi vo petition ka link community post mai daal dena it would be helpful,again hats off to you for speaking on this topic,i dont have any hate for you, i love your vides,mujhe bas un log ko bolna tha jo ek do din baat ye topic bhul jaayega , thats it"
Pehle apne aas paas k log agar ye baat samjh jaaye to puri duniya apne aap samanh jaayegi. Hope that day will come soon when everyone will be equal. Dhruv sir you are best 👍👍👍👍👍❤❤

"Education is not only a right but also a responsibility of all males and females. Prophet Muhammad SAW said:
Seeking knowledge is mandatory for every Muslim (""Muslim"" is used here in the generic meaning which includes both males and females)."
Chhapri toh ladkiya bhi hoti hai lekin tu ek baar bhi unko chhapri nai bolega
u r a virus for the culture  and religion ...very sad u have 14 million follower ... u are doing confues our generation
"It’s a dumb thing to say, “If you’re not a feminist then you are an idiot.” It has become a religion then, if you’re not Christian you’re an idiot, if you’re not Muslim you’re an idiot. I don’t need to call myself a feminist to stand up for women’s right. Feminists only advocate for women’s rights. It’s in the name itself, femin-ism, it’s about females, feminine."
Very good Dhruv 👍
first talk about equal laws
"498a ,DV ,Rape on pretext of marriage, Dowry etc all being misused daily and lots of men doing suicide. Those who face cases know the reality. Visit mahila thana or court for TRUTH. All law for women"
Endless
Tu abibi samajra nai hai ki asli problem kya hai. Sabse bada problem hai exploitation of rights jo ladkiya krti hai . Aise kitne cases hai jaha ladkio ne jhut bolke ladko ki zindagi kharab krdi . Uske baare me to kuch nai bola tune .
Dhruve bhai ladkiii dabb ki rahnii hee chachyaiii
"Gautam Buddha, mahavir, gargi, maitriyi also feminist...."
What about the unequal laws in our constitution for men in divorce or fake rape cases? And there are zero financial rights for men. All the rights are given to women.
lekin ap bas kitabi gyan pel rahe ho......us lukhnow wale case mai hi agar video footage nehi hota to ap vhi jante hai hum vhi jante hai us larke to nyai nehi milta. And apne feminsm ke nam par equal ko chor kar jo females ko extra diya ja raha hai uyo kuy nehi bataya like there are several laws towards womens safety but no law regards mens safety mens rape there is no seat reservation for male is that is called equality????
"Bhai tu kaisa hai yr

bro u  have cleared the real meaning of feminism.....  if a person watched every video of u can become very intelligent ..........
I always like your video even without watching it cause i know you will never talk about wrong things✔️
"I always had this question in my mind since childhood, giving your kids their fathers name and surname is it Patriarchal? If you are a man reading this comment, would you give your kids their mothers name and surname, if you are feminist ? So many questions about it."
"""You're teaching us about feminism while learning it from the one who propagated this agenda. What nature provided as gender roles, the Western civilization has destroyed.""""Allah has granted equal rights to men and women as human beings. However, when they enter into marriage, the rights shift, and responsibilities increase. In Islam, Allah has given specific rights to each gender. Earning is also the responsibility of men, and the safety of the family is in their hands. The Western civilization, which is on the verge of collapse, has brainwashed everyone. You will see the collapse of this civilization soon—its education system, financial system, medicine, science, sociology—everything is destined to collapse."

Thnx for eye opener video ❤
Every youtuber is milking this topic but on the other side Smirti Irani being women and child development minister didn't speak up on Manipur video incident.The funny thing is she blamed Rahul Gandhi.
Hope this video trends no.1 and reaches as many people as possible..these days it’s getting kinda impossible to call ur self a feminist without getting abused online… I mean as a girl I want equal opportunities and pay parity what’s so wrong I don’t get it🙄
I have huge respect for u..but i have a request that u should once read quran and sahih hadees and do research on islam and rights of women's in Islam...
"Feminism is a concept of equal rights for all genders in broader way. I think most of today’s “woke feminist” females don’t understand that when they mention “we don’t need any men”. Feminism is not eliminating men’s role from the society, but an equal rights where men and women can complement each other."

"Totally agree with the root cause of feminism which is "" a woman is free to work if she wants to"" but disagree with the fact that a woman HAS to work and become equal to the man at all cost. It is obvious that one has to start a family and have kids, women whether they work or not have to look after the kids and house most you can observe this even in the west, thus this becomes triring for them and it would be cruel to force them to work as well as take care of children. If a woman decides to become housewife she is shamed by the modern world and labeled retarded. I believe this is against the root cause and even women in the west have started speaking up against it. This type of feminism is nothing but a capitalist agenda to get the whole household working and kids raised on ipads and social media. We need to get out of this"

"I am totally agree with you just asking you genuine questions
When a female harasses aur rapes male then what ? Public and cops say koi lady kaise kisi male ko chhed sakti hai ya uska rape kar sakti hai ?
Why a female cop can search male but a male cop can't search female 
Why men's day not given equal importance as women's day"
I would recommend you to read Judith butler and Nivedita Menon for to understand the difference between sex and gender and know to better about feminism.

"I am a fan of Dhruv but this is the first video of Dhruv Rathee I do not agree with. I agree rights equal hone chahiyea, equal respect honi chahiyea but what Nina Gupta said was also 100 percent correct, when we try to be extremely liberal and unconventional we unknowingly start sounding stupid that is what's happening in this video."
now a days feminist means right for female and discrimination for men
Masterpiece💥💥💥
Everything is temporary but Dhruv rathhe simple Tshirts is permanent😅😂😅😂
"I don't think that men and women are equal like mentally, physically , biologically but in some criteria they are equal as men can't handle children as women does,men can't look after the home as women does and if womens do job mens can't raise the children as women does they both are equal as parents in fact men cant do women's job but women can do most of the men's job"

"Actually feminism is having 4waves. You should have also mentione about woke culture. 

Although, good one."
You should comment about women don't understand real meaning of Feminism. Feminism means Equality but not to show Mens as villean.
Indians mein itna famaly jhagde kyun hote hein dhruv bhai is topic mein ek video banao bhai tang aa chuka hoon..
"Sir First of all you should explain about that what do you mean by “Equal rights”.
And secondly you didn’t properly define the feminism and its historical relation with industrial revolution in west.
Also that how feminism destroyed the west by losing population."

"Ok, tell me one law which is favouring men? Just one. I can tell 100 laws favouring women. Talked about false cases. Can a male file such cases?"
These can be considered as fake feminism
"Today I learn the real meaning of feminism . Thankyou for making so much knowledgeable videos . Is ek word ko kitni galat tariko se use Kiya jata h but aapne SB clear kr diya thankyou so much bhaiya.

"What a coincidence,I am studying Gender ,Religion and caste topic in SST for exams and this video released"
"Confession: I'm late to catching up your videos, but no regrets here! I've become a fan and can't get enough. Your content is awesome!👍🙌🏻👍🙌🏻"
This video made it clear toe too what a femininism does really mean🎉
"Bhai bahut farak hota hai auraton mein aur mardo mein.
Testosterone and oestrogen mein farak pata kitna hai?
Ek average man aur ek average woman mein strength ka farak, temparament ka farak.

Women are gifted the power to give birth to a child.

Men on the other hand are stronger physically on average.

Doesn't mean the women don't deserve equal rights. But.... To forcefully make sure there are 50-50 men and women in all fields? Is a bollocks proposal!"
Feminism can only survive when there is comfort. It is thrown out of the window when life becomes Hard just like in Russia Ukraine war or Titanic women were allowed to Rescue first.
Hats off to you for this video 👏👏
Salute for this video 🫡

"U r awaysome brother....feminism and female looks like close words due to spelling ...so 99% crowd think that meaning of feminism is opposite to petriarchy...or female dominance...or female want positions of male and want to treat male( how female got treatment till now) as a revenge ...I think word feminism should be replaced by ""equality in responsibility"" or something like that where word itself enough to get clear meaning....❤ly explanation"

"I grew up listening to people refer to my father that the wife earns more than you and if I beg to differ that men should be respected and so should women and nothing to do with any isms. Feminists don't like other women so it has nothing to do with men or rights of low lives like matriarchal of partriarchal societies, however I personally believe the men have 11 ribs and women have 12 so let's not bother about equality. 
Its all about who support gay rights and who like the straight order. And you can be referred a misogynist by a feminist when you dont support their right.
Alright video! but again why so diplomatic?*"
In islam womens has more respect and more rights but differrent from mens with many laws and also many laws for mens and rights

It’s because nature have made some cultures for all the animals to go through in their life and sorry to say except humans all the other spices are living their lives willingly, this is only us who have problems with equality 🙂"

"Yes i believe in Equality , but this competition between male and females is baseless and has no scientific evidence showing society progress by giving equale roles and responsiblities to female as same as males. Feminism is a vague concept. This concept failed in west where this word orginated. Many females have accepted that by competing with males for roles and responsiblities have actually made their lives miseable . Its not that females are lower in any sense with males. Its just both are 2 phases of single coin. I know even after giving facts few female will say that i m patriarch saying to just prove patriarch is better . But my answer is no i do not want a society where male opresses females in any way. But at the same time competing with males taking masculin roles in family and society displaces males from there gender roles. And in long run this will disasterous. There is nothing wrong if female wants to help her family get job get equal right. But if it starts overburdening the family and society at large like why should only female has to do this why only we have sacrifice. Then society as whole will stsrt to fail. Ladies you need to understand that when dhruv showed example where females compromise he showed only one aspect , just remember your father and analyse, is he not sacrficing for family or compromising his happines over the family . Just ask for ur father whrn was the last time he bought new undergarment for himself. and yes it doesnt mean that if he sacrifices his happiness he got right to opress women of his family .. absolutely no."
As a human being i am agree with your all points 💕💀💀💀💀👀👀👀

"Imagine this - you are living in a time period millions of years ago where you are a hunter gatherer. You go out to hunt for food and give your beautiful women the meat to cook. Doing this, you get stronger and stronger which was the purpose for you to go out for hunting. So the conclusion is, men must hardwork for their family and his beautiful feminine women must support him in doing so. i hate the term ""toxic masculinity or feminism"" you must be masculine to protect your family and feminist to support your man. I don't care what others take the meaning from this message.99% will probably hate me."

"The problem is, most woman shouting 'smash the patriarchy' are only referring to smashing their problems, and not considering the problems of men at all.

"Ye chize kabhi khatam hone wali nahi h , kitne bhi rights dedo women and men ko , issue toh testosterone and estrogen ka h …the mindset of both genders are different in most of the situation.
And all this happens because of hormones. Dono gender me hormones ka level balance kr do  problem khatam , Then both will know each other very well..
Both genders have their own pain
Samjh pana mushkil h..
Everyone should have their rights whether they are female ,male or LGBTQ 

Or sidhe sidhe jee lo"

"As a student,  i think equality must be seen in educational institution where girls quota exist.
In present time, general category boys are needed to be more educationally smart than a girl to get same college.
This means girls are less educated than boys?
NO
so why this reservation?
Its not a boy's fault to be a boy. A brain dont know if its in a boy's or girl ' s body.

And mr dhruv rathee,  i want you to make a video on caste reservation too"
I am a feminist ❤
"Bhai the problem is not women not speaking in favor of Neha Dhupiya or the girl who slapped the guy on the road senseless. Most men probably get agitated because women didn't criticize them either. Women usually don't go hard on women making mistakes like these but will write an entire thesis on men making mistakes and vilifying them (which is fair if the man has done that). This is obviously a personal observation. Women who make such mistakes are given a room and safe space to grow and ""learn"" from it. Men do not get that chance"

"I am not feminist but mere paas aap ki bohat si baato ka jawab hai jo fact hai, me is par ek video zaroor banata agar me ek youtuber hota"
"Thank you, Dhruv, for your insightful video on feminism! Your clear explanations and thoughtful analysis really help in understanding the importance of gender equality and empowerment. Keep up the fantastic work in promoting awareness and understanding of crucial social issues like this!"
"The very first time i can not agree with you 
While I don't completely disagree with you, I think it's important for women to support their husbands from a slightly less visible position. It's not necessary for them to constantly prove their capability to the world. If we are assigning blame, it's primarily on us men because we tend to treat women as objects, although not everyone does so. Despite their position behind us, we still hold a great deal of respect for them. We acknowledge and admire the challenges they face in maintaining the family. A woman's beauty lies in her gentleness, modesty, and silence."
This is society.🤨
"Society me law hamesha larki kohi support karthi hai na ki larko ko alright, agar dam hain tho iska utthar deke dikhao or majeki bath ye hain ki koi feminist iske uper bath nehi karthe"
Dhruv bhai...sab thik h...i never Miss an upload from you...but PLEASE...BAND KARO KUKU FM 💩
You have not touched about radical feminism .......?
"It's ""equalism"" not ""feminisim""!"
First time I felt dhruv sir has not studied and researched well on this topic.
Apne aap ko feminist kehne or hone me farq hai....... Salman rashdee was not a feminist.... In fact he used to exploit female
Namaskar sir apko aisa feel nahi hota hai ki apko kuku fm ke liye kuch mini second ya second  adhik dena chahiye bcoz wo ache video ko sponsor  karte  hain
Real roaster😂
but i am confused 😕 😕
😅 chapri ladko ko gali de kar koi fayda nahi hai keu ki sabhi chapri boys ko lagta hai ki vo chapri nahi hai 😂
23:54 They didn't support but didn't criticized her either.  Agar yahi koi ladka kisi ladki ko slap karta then these feminist would have ruined his life but Just bcz she is a girl they all remain silent on this issue. Women want equality only when it benefits them
As a woman i wish i could give 1000 likes on this video. You hve explained every aspect so well. 👏👏👏
"I praise you as a content creator and acknowledge your intellectualism but you shouldn't have to call a person legendary who has deliberately and several times sadistically hurted the sentiment of hundred of thousands of people of a religious belief...Salman Rushdie is an evil in disguise and if you're unable to call him that because there is a segment in this world who likes him then atleast you shouldn't also call him a legend of you portray yourself as an unbiased journalist.

Mujhe lagta hai ladko ko koi problem nahi hai women rights ko lekar problem is bat se hai ki kuch ladkia us rights ka galat use karti hai un ladkiyo se pareshani hai
I agree and can relate to each and every words said by you...
"Those who give the reason of tradition for supporting patriarchy are truly irreligious people. Our culture is all about equality that's we say a wife as the ardhangini or the better half(equal). And you take up all the couple gods and goddesses you will find them completing each other. Like lord brahma, the creator will obviously need information or knowledge (DNA) to create life and he has mata saraswati for this the goddess of wisdom and knowledge. Lord Vishnu the preserver needs resources to preserve life and hence he has mata Laxmi, we worship her on Diwali too for good fortune and plenty of resources or money and success. And lastly devo ke dev mahadev, the destroyer needs power for destruction and hence Devi Parvati, Shakti. When Devi Parvati was troubled by some asuras she came up to mahadev and told him. He said why have u came to me go and fight urself. Why women have to seek help from their male counterparts? I have made them enough strong to protect themselves. And that's when she took the Kali avatar. And she was so angry at that time that lord Shiva had to come in disguise of a child to invoke her soft side. And the names Radha-Krishna, Laxmi-Narayan, Gauri-Shankar too say it all."
i changed my mind ... i think we blindly opposing feminism ...now its time to support it .... and oppose chapri alpha men and also chapri girls😂

Which right of girls are denied now??  If none then what is need of feminism now a days?? I am not against anyone I Just Want to Know (May Dhruv pin this so I could get so many answers)
"10:05 yes everyone is not similar. But we always see equal rights are give only in situations where general population has some sort of advantage. But then why are SC ST and Handicapped are given full fee remissions in govt places while the general EWS category students are given lesser fee remission. 5LPA in 2024 in India is nothing, and the people earning lesser than this are given small remissions. 
What if the SC ST and Handicapped student belongs to a rich background?"
15:45 TOTALLY DISAGREE BY THIS POINT BECAUSE ME AND FRIENDS TALKS ON EMOTIONAL TO FUNNY MOMENTS THIS IS NOT ONLY WITH ME BUT WITH MY ALL FRIENDS. WHY THEY ARE FRIENDS IF THEY CAN'T DISCUSS THEIR PROBLEMS...??
Thankyou Dhruv sir for making this video .🩵🩵  This is what I want to tell peoples around me but they never understand it and I also started thinking maybe I am wrong but now I am confident and I am never wrong about what feminist really meant .Thank you so much 🪷🪷

"So.. Feminism in a nutshell can be understood as a thought/movement advocating women's right to be free from the ""clutches"" of traditional societal norms where they are ""forced"" to take care of their families and instead work for their bosses ? Where's the ""freedom"" ? I thought Feminist's were fighting for freedom."

"Excellent excellent work on faminism, keep it up Dhruv💗💗💗💗💗😊"
"Equality is a good thing, but can a woman do all the work that a man does without risking his life and sometimes losing his life?Can she do this by risking her life?Equality is a good thing for both, it should be there regarding studies, socially and politics just like as men but God has made woman soft and man hard so that they can work according to their body , in some activities and cases women cannot do that men can do even mindset needs ! Support feminists is a good but some women among these feminists, speak directly to the contrary and do not respect and by doing wrong things in the name of feminist and calling it equality and then later blaming people who do such like bravery works and hardworks Our soldiers work so hard to protect us in the war on our borders.  Whatever the weather, whatever it may be, they do very dangerous missions, construction works ,coal mining etc.. which are not so possible for a female and we have men who do such dangerous tasks which are very risky.  It requires a very strong mind and in such a situation, some people and women do not respect them for this.Some women and girls of today consider themselves feminist but they wrongly celebrate it as if they believe in foreign civilization, follow it and do not accept their Indian traditional and do not even respect them not good. That doesn't seem good today.  That's why an educated feminist is necessary to tell everyone this And should be accepted and told that feminist is a good thing.  Women should be given equal rights and privileges as men.  But there are some things which women cannot do.  They need men, so we should respect them, they don't understand this and it spreads wrong message in the society.  As Dhruv sir said that both men and women built differently by body structure by few 3 or 4 body parts are different but 70% structure is same functional  also difference is there emotionally built in comparison of both. our Women and our sisters are stronger today but women are also sweet and softhearted...but mostly mens are emotionally built very strong as compared to women...we should be an educated feminist, just remember a few things and learn them. Accept and respect some things that people need to accept I don't know how many people will call it good or bad but these things are true. Both women and men need in our society we should respect both and should be given equal rights to both ! But respect is only for good !!"
I am not agree with u this topic
Very true.women are more cunning and wicked.i have noticed this.
Thank you bhaiya for  everything
If i may ? I would like to pose an interesting question. Are all human beings truly equal ? these days everywhere you go there's a talk about fight for equality. As wise man once said heaven dose not create one person above or below another. People like to throw his words around. we are all equal at birth pretty soon things begin to change. Academic effort is what sets some people apart rise above the others . At any rate humans change over time based on their actions. Truth be told at the end of the day Equality is just a fantasy. And most of us go through life denying the fact that we live in meritocracy. Man and woman not equal .
Bhai लॉरेंस pe bhi banao
"If you are a true feminist then you must cover the rising false rape and domestic violence cases on men by women in India. It destroys the man's life and the woman, even if proven wrong in court doesn't suffer from any legal action. 

Around 74% rape cases in India are false. High time this is taken up by the masses and force the government to amend laws, just like women rights have been awarded through people's voices."

"Amazing brother, you are doing great work.. I had same confusion regarding feminism, you clarified it really well.. I also think that any wrong acts performed by women should not be justified in name of feminism and women empowerment as you mentioned and there should be more awareness in society to differentiate real feminism from fake feminism"

Always top rated topic sir
"Nature didn’t make us equal you piece of 💩. Men can never achieve the qualities and greatness women have. 

Man is a natural giver & woman is a natural receiver.  In terms of sperms, money, protection, strength and even sacrificing life.

Under the guise of domestic violence & so called freedom, don’t drag women to a level where she has to deal with two fronts i.e. Family & Work. 

I think, 
In Human history these & coming years are gonna be worst times for women. They are made to do things that are not natural for them. 

Ladies don’t buy anything this scum or his likes says. 

I m tau Born to love, respect & die for the girls of my house. But yes i won’t support women of my house to be like whores & bitches just to show the world that they are free & can carry or live the way they want."

"The  real feminism matters after post marriage.
Haven't seen a true feminist while getting married or after that.
Either patriarchy or matriarchy."
95 % of fire fighter are men . What about the equity here 😅
"Feminism is for equal rights but many laws say that feminism means equality for women only, man go to hell. Its not about equal right its about faults in law due to which some woman missused it and harrash men and the funny thing is that if the woman got guilty after that there is no law for woman for that particular crime according to law that type of crime only belongs to men due to which many men lifes were ruined. But no one talks about that even though i think right for women law is more as compared to men and people are getting known about it but no one should talk about mens right ."

और जिस पुरूषवादी विचारधारा की बात कर रहे हो वो तो आदिकाल से चली आ रही है। जब से फेमिनिस्म जैसा जबर्दस्ती का नाटक आया है तभी से घर परिवार बर्बाद होने शुरु हुए। इसके पहले एसा था ही नही। 
पुरुषवाद कोई सोच नही बल्कि प्राकर्तिक सत्य है चिकने आदमी। 
लेकिन तू नही समझेगा क्योकि तू बहुत बडा पेटीकोट छाप है। वाकई तू औरतो के समान है। हम मर्द नही।😂"

"Problem is the word “feminism”. It comes from word female. Majority people didn’t know the meaning of feminism and thought this resembles with female so should be about more rights for women or less rights for men which would look like more rights to women. Latter took precedence over many cases is it’s sad reality. Even if you look at history the word feminism was coined to give more rights to women in 1800’s. First change the name feminism with something gender neutral. Second rights are a choice I.e., full time dad has slowly becoming a norm. Similarly housewife is a choice. In an household wife is not managing house and husband works full time job then wife talking about equal rights! What is equal in it? Now let’s take an example of 2 strangers man and women. If women slaps, man should definitely slap back. Man should not hold back thinking he has 10 times power to do a serious damage, is that what equal rights mean?  Men and women are not equal. One completes another. Rights are choices not necessarily actioned. For instance, you are on a date and you decide to pay the bill instead of spending splitting. Girl has the right to split the bill and boy also has the right to ask for share. Both have their rights but choice would make the difference. Agree??"
"Tab to feminism ka name Humanism rakh deni chahiye kyunki isme sabhi genders, race, skin color, caste  ke liye hai ek revolutionary chiz hai."

"Male aur female equal nahi hay aur kabhi ho bhi nahi shakta. Kuch aspects me male age hay aur kuch me female. Itna hi equal hay sab kuch to har sports me male female separate events keu hota ? Aaj se 50k sal pahle tak society me male aur female ke equal rights the , koi ek dusre ko nahi dabata tha ( Anthropological evidence hay , search in Google). Lekin uss samay tak insani sabhyata ka bikash lagvag na ki barabar hota tha. 50k sal ki baad se society pe mard rule karna suru kia fir aaj hum insani sbhyata mars tak pahach gaye. Jis chis se ham age bar rahe hay use reverse karne ki kya zarurat. Is faminism ki chutiappa bas last 200 salo se suru hua industrial revolution ki baad se . Keu ki industries me labour force bahut chahie tha isi lie aurat oo ko kaam karne kelie uksaya gaya. Lekin aaj bhi high risk wale jobs me ( army , sewerage cleaning, mining etc)  males kahi domination hay aur age bhi rahega. Keu ki in saab jobs me sports ki tarah aap seperate domain establish nahi kar shakte females ke lie. World ko rule aur dominate karne kelie aapko chahiye raw physical strength aur tough mentality jo sirf mard ke pass hota hay , keuki mother nature hame aisehi evolve kiya hay. Jin jin samaj aur desh me feminism ki increase hua hay , waha par family structure aur society bilkul tutne ki kagar pe hay sabkuch rahne ki bawajud. 

May females ki against nahi hu . May sabhi insaan ki bahut izzat karta hu aur yeh bhi kahta hu ki aurat ke bina insani sbhyata survive nahi kar payega. Lekin hame yeh bhi manna parega ki ek aurat kabhi bhi Usain Bolt ki record nahi tor payenge aur ek admi kabhi bhi ek bacche ki mentality ko ek aurat ki tarah acchi tarikese sambhal nahi shakega. 
I am only speaking true facts . If you say me misogynist for my remarks, then I am a proud misogynist."

"Dhruv, You're totally right. Basically the point is, still people don't understand the feminism or the meaning it possess. Most of the chapri gang use this to justify any kind of problems caused by a woman.

Another thing, I think you should bring to limelight, the pseudo-feminism, its not the some chapri boys gang who don't know the feminism properly, there are some spoiled-girls too who justify any kind of violence or aggressive action against men as feminism act to demolish men instead of patriarchy. Most of the time they use the faminism term for their own benefit to play victim card. A lot of male suffers for wrong cases raised by women.

We want a world where everyone should have equal rights across the different types of religions, genders, castes and races. Want a world where nobody points a finger and say you are man, its your responsibility, you are a woman, its your responsibility, instead of all these we would figure out everything together, no gender duties."

"My ex left me because I'm not looking and poor compared to her, but i never talked that she has bad character, nor I don't know very deep about her personal relations, only thing I felt bad was she secretly maintained other relationship while having relationship with me, I came to know about it from others and then she confessed and broke up with me, I have confidence that I will earn decent money for basic living but from that day i don't feel about good my physical appearance, I have severe trust issues, and can't enter into any relationship with that trust issue, I don't think all women are evil, because I have sister and mother, if I think all women are same then they will also get included in that, in the same way all men are not evil, it's just that our natural tendency is to look for beautiful and loyal women who will not cheat us, in the same way women seek for good looking, strong and loyal men who will not cheat on her and her children (in case of searching partner for marriage)
I feel that in olden days women were not much educated so they used to marry any men selected by family, but now they are free to select according to their natural tendency, so this generation is hard to survive for bad looking and poor men like me and also bad looking girls, and if anyone thinks that beauty and love in people is subjective then go and marry poor short fat black bald men or women, partially it may be subjective but largely it is programmed in our biology"
"Thanks Sir .
ab mai feminism , patriarchy aur matriarchy sabhi ke baare me ache se samjh gaya..❤"
"Being a girl, my father has given me equal rights like my brothers, and yes my brothers do cry, we support them emotionally. And my brothers support me in my career they always applaud whenever I get promoted. Yes we live in this society where I'm allowed to live my life freely."
"Not only are we physically different but also our hormones are different. Even though we possess equal intelligence, our brain functions in different ways. If you still think we are equal, ask yourself why ovulation created 2 separate genders? To procreate? There are lots of species in the world who can give birth while being the only gender in a given time in life. We are different because our differences complement each other. Even in the ancient world men went hunting and women took care of the children. We need each other to survive. But one must lead the way and men are doing this from the beginning of the world. Men are better at decision making. While women are more caring and nurturing."
buht badiya dhruv bhaiya.
you know but it is due to patriarchy that men are more likely to be successful because the competitiveness creates an environment for the stronger and does not favour the weaker. yes a lot of men are in depression but lot of them are successful and due to this disparity our society has come this far. talking about the effects it has on men not women.

"Kuch log toxic feminism kar dete hai really me, bahut se case me jab woman guilty thi tab feminism nahi ata lekin boys, pahunch gaye feminist"
"Only logical thinking is done by Dhruv Rathee and all other's thinking and logic are bogus... A person in a 25 min video explains the whole socio-economic development and psychological distinction of sexual orientation of men and women...just always support the populist move and try to establish the same without going deep into the matter, without analysing the primitive conditions and present world demands and in-hand examples of gender equality and diversity and work proportions.😂😂😂😂😂😂"
par bhai tune jab ye toxic feminism ko glorify karne wale shows tab unpe videos nahi banaye na...wo toh tere animal video k liye call out kar diya bas isiliye banaya ye video vrna banata bhi nai...ye fact h!!!

Please make video on Dr. B.R.  Ambedkar. Show his life and what he face those days
"I agree with majority of the things but one thing i find it wrong, when u criticize those chapri thinking they don't want equal rights, u should considered who is running feminism movement these days. SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS! They are anti men, they are justifying casual sex as independence of choice, Movies like Four more shots etc aren't equally criticize like animal. Also these days pro women laws are heavily misused which create mistrust. Also if they do equal work they deserve equal pay. So it's responsibility of feminist to see how they want to portray this movement rather than those chapris."
"Patriarchy zindabd.. Men shouldn't let their rights to those who are using it for fun, drink, Boyfriends, dominance, misbehave... The difference God has made can be change by any means.. Patriarchy long live"
As a class 10th students now I understand actually what is a feminism ❤
Dhruv rathi ji Aaj kal aapne sacchai chodkar Modi ji ki burai karne focus nhi kar rahe hai kyu kya aap bhi Modi ya godi media ka favour karte hai?

"Tum Jin Jin feminists ka naam le rahe ho, wo log Instagram pe livestream kr rahe the jab ek ladki ne us ladke ko thappad mar rahi thi. Aur uss livestream pe kahi door door tak uss ladke ki zikar nahi tha. Wo ye discuss kr rahe the ki, oh, ab feminism ka kya hoga, humara kya hoga, ab toh video bohut viral ho raha hei wagera wagera. Kisiko justice ki koi baat nahi fikar nahi thi. Kisine ye nahi kaha ki kuch galat hua hei. Kisine ye nahi kaha ki hume uss ladke ki side Lena cahiye. Unko to bas feminism brand ki padi thi. Infact wo ye discuss kr rahe the ki video ko kaise viral hone se roka jaye. This video is still there I believe. Maine pura livestream deka, aur ko koi lallu pillu activists nahi the. They are the most renowned ones. Tab se mei bhi ye feminism wagera se door rehta hu. This incident and their livestream changed my mind forever. I WAS a feminist, but not anymore since then."

Men and women are not same(there is a difference between same and equal). Both have different stengths and weaknesses. Both should work together for the betterment of society.
👍👍 People should know about the real meaning..and be aware of these people who shows them selves alpha male..a alpha shown by his character..
But feminists especially in the west are more of the matriarchy type

very well explained
Being feminist while eating animals is next level of hypocrisy
Embrace Masculinity and Reject Modernity
"Its all true and fine in what you said about faminist but as a tribal here in Manipur,we are not consider as an average human being,as a matter of facts we are treated as an animals who are savages can you pls make a show on how the north_easterns are suffering?? It will be a blessing if you do...i personally want to let others know that we are here in India too and that we care and we too feel pain,it really hurt when our voices are being suppressed like in this on going civil war with our neighbours meitei population. Thank you ✌️☮️"
"Men and women are not equal by nature. That's why you can see separate world cup football or cricket or other athletics. Similarly most of the cases, their instincts are also different. Yes, there are exceptions, but it's not justified that every men and women are similar. Besides, in an office, smart and bewakuf men are also not similarly treated. Smart males get promotions, increments, responsibilities while dumb males are only home to office to home. Nothing is equal. So the idea is irrelevant of equalizing."

21:20 toxic feminism
India is not ready for real feminism
Honestly Dhruv Rathee is one of the most educated content creator💯
"bro I still cant get the viewpoint that the movie Animal is considered misogynist? literally how?? never once the anti-hero mistreated his woman, slapped her etc, but she on the other hand did. now i get it he asked his second affair to lick his boots, yes so what, she was there to cheat on him which will lead to the death of his whole family, basically making her an enemy, so i don't see anything bad in it. don't even talk about bobby deol because is supposed to be the antagonist. this whole argument is baseless, you might as well start protesting against weapon use in movies, killing people in movies, and eventually movies altogether."
"Thanks My Dear: Meri Request poori karne ke liye, 

1 & half month pehle is video ki  thi,  ThankU so much❤"
"I don't agree with a lot of things in the video.

In nature, men and women have been made different and hence both have got perks and disadvantages in different different conditions/situations. Hence men and women have been made equal by nature.

Eg. A woman is more capable of taking care/nourishing children/family. And men are more capable of being tough and being resourceful for the family. Now bcz of this biological truth, both have pros and cons. Like since woman is supposed to stay at home, she tends to have less 'freedom'. On the other hand man has got 'freedom' but has the responsibility of earning and risk of outside harms.

By artificially giving equal power to women, in reality we are giving more power to women and hence creating inequality.

Eg. By giving freedom and choice of choosing their romantic partners to women, society has taken away most of the power from men to get into a healthy relationship without compromising with his dignity.

I know it sounds complicated but it's true and difficult to explain in a comment."

"I'll pray on his behalf that he never gets to witness the consequences of accepting the lies that feminism sells. I hope that Dhruv never goes through what the older men go through. Of course I'll be hated for this comment, but the social conditioning is huge. Soon it'll be too late; people will come to realize what's wrong and what's right. But I'll leave this message here: feminism and the message he conveyed are wrong."

"has any one ever seen a single girl of today’s generation inspired by movie like dangal

but i have seen millions of women’s inspired by movies like
 four more shots
thappad

if men makes money they will marry an uneducated women

but if a women earn money they will find someone richer

this is the reality of mens and today’s girls society"
"I  Do consider myself a Feminist But anything to much is not good for anyone, everything should have limit
Creating equal opportunities is okay but favouring one over  other is wrong , leave movies out of conversation because its a form of art expression i am ok with Animal and also thankyou for  coming"

bruh this is one of the dumbest video you ever made. Most of the things are factually wrong.
I agree with you on most things you mentioned however Indian laws only favour women and nowadays some women are misusing the law for their benefit and men are bearing the brunt of it despite being right and according to the recent survey these kind of cases are on the rise so don't you think this is an oversight when we talk about Real Feminism.

What a video! Loved it a lot. Loved your work❤
conclusion:- daru pike mat pito
after this video millions of people believe in feminism 🥰
bro has beef with sandeep reddy vanga
I'm  feminist
To me feminism is to gain extra facilities to compete with men.
"Yeh Dhruv Rathee kabhi nahi sudhrega...

He is totally mocking about men's rights...
only wants mens to be emotional and vulnerable.

Dhruv don't understand Men's problem, he will never.  And this type of mindset makes him more patriarchal."
This is called a real knowledge ❤
"Give women a space where they are safe from eyes, hands and minds of perverts or manipulators at schools, colleges and workplaces instead of pushing them naked towards above mentioned characters. We vociferate about women's empowerment but are not able to create an environment where they don't have to interact much with men . There should be different sections ,  colleges, departments in private and government sectors for ""women only"" entry is allowed. Then you can see women being able to grow confidently and without being spoiled or utilized. Another benefit of doing that is the wives can be send to work without fear of having extra marital affairs. It may sound strange, some countries including Saudi has implemented this and succeeded till recent years. But sadly it' may not happen because people are attuned to free mixing."
"As the smartest Youtuber, DhruveGoat, faught Toxic feminism, he began to expand his domain,

"Dhruv, Are you kidding me? Is mein feminism ki baat kaha hai, bhai.. Poora patriarchy ki baare mein bhola.😂🙏 You spoke about age-old patriarchy which has nothing to do with the adverse effects of modern feminism on today's society, especially how innocent men are suffering?👎 
This is the classic textbook version of feminism. It's either Dhruv living under a rock thinking women are still getting oppressed or doing this propaganda video to cover up the truth about toxic feminism. If druv himself is a feminist. How can we expect him to expose the reality of feminism? Of course, he will back up his fellow femtard community.👎"
Very helpful video sir ☺️
"In hindu religion both are equal but women little bit superior that's why mira phoole, and jhasi ki rani and krishn touched radharani feet .. 

For my Opinion we are not equal women are superior I guess, if a a girl slap me in front of everyone nobody cares if you reverse this people around their would Kill me, and you can See that where fan girls kiss male actor or Celebrity without his consent but man cant do that, laws are against men etc etc that's why women is superior but I don't have a problem for that 🤝🤝"
Great content sir but the lady who speak Marathi she was true example of feminism you should watch her video thoroughly. She was forced to left the school due to marriage she raised her child made his career then she continued her study and became loyer at the age of 45 . Instead of earning money from her practice she decided to serve for society as many women used to misuse law which were made to protect women. She had saved so many lives and families .She used to teach both male and female for better understanding of relations and how can we make them better . She just want to reserve our social value of family which rapidly tends to become westernise

feminism never or some times supports wrong doing of females true but it also never speaks against it they play safe 23:51 (support dikhana aur against stand karna alag hai feminism ko problamatic reason se esleye relate karte kyu ke feminism eske aginst stand nhi hota baas mens ke against stand hota hai). Where as mens stand for whats wrong its wrong and whats right its right despite genders involved.
His video is so conceptual ❤

"Good explanation of feminism. But it should also be explained why feminism is gaining a bad reputation. 

Well to do women who claim themselves as feminists have started using feminism as per their convenience and as a tool. So people generally equate feminism to something negative. For example, you gave the example of arranged marriage which as you said can be attributed to patriarchal conditioning. However, many girls who call themselves feminists are still continuing the tradition. So there’s two sides of the coin and I felt this side wasn’t explained."
"23:05 

MEN WILL BE MEN ❎

BOYS WILL BE BOYS✅

By the way this video has changed our thinking physiology"
Bhai aap ladki ki hi side rho
"Can't believe Dhruv made Patriarchy sound bad. I thought he well informed about the topic he talks about, not in this atleast. Patriarchy or Matriarchy aren't bad. Because we need a head of the family whether Father (Patriarchy) or Mother (Matriarchy). We humans want a leader/head everywhere. Like PM for a country, Manager in an office, HoD in a department etc. 
The issue is with Misogyny (toxic Patriachy and Chauvinism) and Misandry(toxic Feminism and toxic Matriarchy) where one gender hates other gender. We need to address/discuss these two terms. Poor video. Looks like in last 5 mins, he realised he had to talk about the topic he mentioned in Thumbnail, so he was forced to add some content there about toxic feminism. Rest of the vidoe is all the every day rant we hear from uninformed people."
Mtv Roadies ma jb ase hi ek ladki ayi uss na bola ki uss na bht saro ladkon sa cheat kiya tb tu uss na shabashi di it's time to unfollow you
Nationalism in Nndia ka bara ma video bana
J sai nd anand rangathan ko expose kro or please
Thumbnail final nhi kiya kya ek baar
I feel even us girls should re-learn the REAL meaning of feminism which is getting blurred in today's time. Doing immoral and unethical things in the name of being equal to men is NOT feminism. And I hope such women would stop using the word 'Feminism' to justify their wrong actions. Cuz it makes other women suffer.

Giving women equal rights is good aur aisa hona bhi chahiye👍But not in all cases my friend...it is not possible
"@dhruvrathee apne feminism ka matlab to bataya, lekin kuch log jo feminism ke naam pe basically matriarchs hai uske baare mein nahi bataya. Feminism shabd ka asli matlab bohat logo ko pata hi nahi hai jiske wajah se wo matriarchy ko feminism samajh lete hai.
Main asha karta hun ki aap firse is topic pe video banayenge jismein aap pseudo feminism ke baare mein baat karenge, men's rights ke baare mein baat karenge, and how pseudo feminists are taking advantage of the laws made to safeguard women, uske baare mein bhi baat karenge."

respect for you"
Why you didn't mention anything about Nivedita Menon....!?
"While talking about male feminists (which basically is a sub component of humanist).. You could have mentioned Dr. BABA SAHEB AMBEDKAR.. He has great many insight on this subject.. And of course his famous quote..""we can measure the progress of a society by  measuring the progress of females of that society"""

"You explained feminism really well, but I feel you have the responsibility to make a video against toxic feminism as well. You made a 20 minutes long video against Animal, exposing toxic masculinity, then why not make a similar video on toxic feminism???"
one sided thinking!
"I have a very different view from other contemporary views , I am neither a patriarchal nor a feminist, but I rather believe in considering eveybody as human, surely I am an admirer of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule and Savitribai Phule who encouraged Women's education , for me women should demand rights like equal education, equal pay, creation of a safe environment, stopping of crime against women etc., but what I am really against is putting posters and demanding rights like , right to smoke, right to consume alcohol (this actually only benefits the companies producing them), asking for right to have multiple partners etc.I call these things as pseudo-feminism,  infact on the other handI get impressed by how high a girl is educated , I always hate people who marry their girls when young and thus indulge in child marraige , my views is don't consider somebody as  man or woman but as human , and I completely disagree with the man loliness thing, it has more to do with being an extrovert or introvert rather than being a man or a woman , I myself share my problems or worries with my friends and also my friends do the same , infact many of my friends have also shared experiences of even their 'intimate' things, only the difference is that personal or emotional talks between two boys always remain only between two of them and that is why the outside world never knows about it, but personal talks between two girls may not always remain only between two of them."
Very good
"Dear dhruv rathi mai aapka bahut bada fan hu but aap kabhi apne video me muslim samaj ka example kyo nahi dete muslim samaj ki auraten sabse jyada partadit hai religion ke naam par , kya aapko bhi sar tan se juda ka dar to nahi lagta hai, god bless you, kabhi uthaiye kisi moulana ka vidio, anyway aapka kaam bahut hi sarahniy hai"

If Male and female are equal then why God make them Different ???
You mentioned everything correctly and calmly Dhruv ❤👌🏻 Hope now ppl can understand Feminism clearly!!

3:01 kya sun liya kya dekh liya 🤮🤮🤮🤮
"Appreciate the way he explained Feminism. In every religion rights of women have described and how can we exceed the limit. Let me share an example here
In Qur'an
The Koranic verse (4:34) that 'men are in charge of women
In Bible
(Ephesians 5:23). So man is designated the head of the woman in the same way as Christ is head of the church."
"I really like these kind off vids, it act as a proof for me wherever if i got stuck in any conversation with someone about topics like this. It literally represents all those thoughts of mine about feminism which i didn't know how to put into words till now. From not supporting the girl and drivers fight to kamala bhasin's ted x talk, from women also supporting patriarchy to become a feminist, from authors saying either a feminist or idiots to struggles and will of mahatma bhai phule , it all comes with a right message and conclusion.
But today's problem is that most of us believe in which is not the truth, the truth can be hidden behind the tag of kabir singh and animal and other issues ofc but what truly feminism wants to tell nobody cares about it"
"Whatever you said is definitely correct and the problem is no one understands this. I have often heard this that, ""That girl is one of those feminist types"", meaning she is a bad person. It is said in this way. Now there is another problem that has raised in India. As of 2024, women do have certain rights that empower them. One such is the dowry law, where the groom's family can be charged for dowry. Now as we know the seriousness of the dowry cases, the law has been made in a way to get swift action in case of a complaint. Adding into that, the law enforcement officials often times harass the accused. So in a false case, this can be a huge issue and this in turn is defaming the whole women empowerment agenda, and the mindset is being pushed to the same, ""ladki padh likh legi toh hath se nikal jayegi"" mindset. Now this is the same thing you mentioned in your video that, women are also the enemies of feminism. Personal motives and greed is just damaging the reputation of women. (Again, there have be 1000s of incidents of dowry where the grooms family may have even went to an extent to kill the wife, but if 1 women askes for divorce and alimony that is a way bigger issue on social media. Both are wrong according to me. But which one has more engagement on social media? Just see it.) 

Now there is an argument that - What rights men have that women don't? Yes as of 2024, women have all the legal rights that men have. But on the ground level the mindset as not changed. It is very common to hear, ""Why are you spending so much on your daughter's education, leave something for her marriage as well."" As of right now, the feminists' fight is with patriarchy and not the legal system. The legal system battle has been won for a while now. In the future, I want to see a society where women don't need the extra laws to protect them. When that happens, those alpha males will not have to worry about a women taking away 50% of his net worth."
"I'm Agree with Neena Gupta, cause she is right forever ♾️. Agar Mard aur Aurat same hai yaa jo bhi bara bari ki batein ho rhi hai yeh saab bakwas hai."
Feminism is the reason of Divorces 😢
"Mard aur aurat kisi idaray ke baghair barabar hain,
Agar yeh kisi idaray ka hissa hain to phir barabar nahin ho sakte isliye idaray mein kisi ek ko sarbrah banana padega, misaal ke tor par ek idaray mein agar do mard hain to dono mein se kisi ek ko sarbrah banana padega warna idara chal nahi sakega, aise hi agar aurat hai us idaray mein to sirf us ko bhi sarbrah banaya ja sakta hai phir un dono mardoon ko us ek aurat ki sarbrahai qubool karni chahiye taake idara sahi chal sake.
Aise hi shaadi bhi ek idaray ko wajood mein laati jis se ek khandan kuchh talluqat wajood mein aate hain. Yeh idara ek bachay ki zaroorat hai. Agar us idaray mein koi bhi apna kirdaar sahi se ada nahi karega to yeh idara bikhar jaega.
Is liye Islam ne yeh shaadi jaisa nizaam bataya aur yeh jab se insaniyat ki ibteda hui hai usi waqt se hai aur yeh tareeqa Khuda ne bataya hai."

"I only have a question. Why should we pronounce the word feminism, why should we add feminine or some combination of such word to describe equality of gender..

We should only say equality to avoid any controversy being created in social media."
"Hey.. Why did u change the original video name to this. Pls bring bk ""animal vs feminism"". That was perfect.. Don't do this😢"

Vai khai India aake dekho ... ground reality bohut alg he ...yaha aurat aadmi ko faminism ke nam pe suicide ke alaba dusra rasta nahi chorta he ... constitution to ekk mazak ban ke reh gaya ...aadmi o ke liye kuch nahi he aurat ke samne
Feminist doesn't support that lucknow girl ...but that guy was in the jail for sometime without any reason..what is your opinion on that ?
Important topic ❤
"Sir, in reality we humans are a breed or irony itself. So, it would be foolish to except equality among any two beings. Rather than equality it would be more beneficial to cacceptance towards other ideologies rather than idiotic confrontations."

"2:43
Dhruv bhai...
Aap apni baat kijiye gaa.

""Har samjhdaar aadmi feminist hee hoga"" ye kehna mei theek nahi maanta.

Aaj agar har aadmi ye kehna shuru karein....

ki hazaaro saalo se hum aadmiyon ne Army, construction, infrastructure, industrial processes mei bada se bada yogdaan diya hai...

  aur auraton ne aasaan kaam(housewife) hee kiya hai...

Toh aaj hame bhi house husband bann ne kaa haq chaahiye. Auraten border sambhaalengi, hum bacche sambhaalenge.

Ab socho...
Aisi soch waale aadmi se koi shaadi karna chaahega? 

Meri raaye mei koi samjhdaar aurat toh nahi karna chaahegi.

Theek usi tarah, aaj Indian men(incl. Myself) marriage ko leke kaafi serious hai.

Kyunki Ladkiyon ke dimaag feminism crap se bhar chuka hai, jaise...

Aadmiyon ne auraton ko control Kiya hai...
Kewal bacche paida karwaane ki machine banaakar rakha hai...
Naukraani banaakr rakha hai...
Slave bana rakha hai...
Wagarah dhimkaana.

Aaj west iss pareshaani se ubhar raha hai, aur India iss pareshaani mei ghusaa jaa raha hai.

Rathee ji, aap feminist ho, aap baraabari ki baat karte ho...
Toh iska matlab ye nahi ki khudd parr samjhdaar hone kaa thappa laga do....

Mei nahi maanta, that men and women are equal.
Men and women have different responsibilities, different psychologies, different biologies.

Please ponder on this."
"One thing I've noticed after watching many of your videos that, many of the facts are not correct in your videos, I don't know what research you do  before video."
"You didn't emphasize on the fact clearly how films like ""four more shots"" and ""thank you for coming"" are portraying feminism in a wrong way and how they are inplanting incorrect ideas of feminism in the minds of both boys and also girls thus affecting both the genders , but when films like ""Animal"" are made you protest stating how it can influence boys in the wrong way and can turn them into toxic individuals"
"Sorry but I personally believe that patriarchy is the best ideology among them
Patriarchy promotes masculinity among the man that is right thing
Nowadays the man loosing their masculinity"

"You explained in really well 
If we observe it deeply then we came to know that in patriarchy men’s suffer the most and in feminism women’s suffer but our society takes it in an opposite way
Only ill mannered men thinks that patriarchy makes men superior from women 
And well cultured people know that respect which a patriarchy society can give to a woman feminism can never….

I am a patriarchy though of guy who knows that women should be given more respect in the name of mother,sister,wife,daughter and other female relatives"

Raam and Ravan were both the greatest patriarchal mythological characters.
"Equal rights ke naam par vo kuchh bhi kare ,Gali de,saare legal laws favour me ho,kuchh bhi Bolney ka haq ho, thik"
"This is my take and I do not know how many agree:
I am against feminism, the concept that women and men are equal. Women are more precious than men, they need more protection and men should protect them.
A brother should protect his sister, a son should protect his mother, a father should protect his daughter, a boyfriend should protect his girlfriend,  a husband should protect his wife and finally any man should protect any woman.
The sad part about feminism is it is gaslighting women and turning them against men. While there are a minority of animals who call themselves men, majority of men are normal human beings who believe women are human beings just like them, specially the newer generation is more commendable in this regard. 
Those who say women are equal to men are stupid, of course they are physically and mentally different. Women and men are opposites, opposites attract and create a beautiful balance in life.
All we need to do is acknowledge that both men and women are human beings with their differences. 
Human rights and laws should be designed to empower the weaknesses and punish injustice against both men and women. 
Replace feminism and patriarchy with humanism."
At least someone talked about it

Mens dont want women to be equal to them because if they are equal to them they would teach their kids what is right and wrong and this is what politicians dont want as people without ability to identify what is right or wrong may open peoples eye that what really is democracy
So sir when a patriarchal women also fight for feminism can't be considered a matriarch? Because they want equal rights but also with their conditions in which they have patriarch thinking. What I am noticing happening is that those who carry the flag of feminism are more a matriarch or patriarch because they want rights but with conditions so this is what making society more toxic. Thanks for the video sir equality should be given but also society needs to be educated well to stay away from those men and women who can't define actual feminism and carry flag or patriarchy or matriarchy.
You should also make a part 2 explaining pseudo feminism
Bhai reality me tune khali kitabe padhi hai ok
Wah topic tha feminism phir garud purad
Next video on Pakistan crisis/ Elections in Pakistan/Imran Khan in prison 😢😢😢
Sabse pahla date kya tha
i love this guy..but but i will also say that feminism people potrayed today is absolutely nothing similar to what dhruv sir said. thank you dhruv for this video. More than informative this video is an eye opener for each and every ill informed feminist and alpha male out there
6:26  if I don't want to laugh so I don't and said what in this to laugh
Well appreciated 👏 The root of development is the power of feminism.
"The places to disagree:
1) Those chapri boys alone are not responsoble...many girls and women also did support those nonsene films and neha dhupia's activity saying feminism...who will discriminate between real and pseudo?

2) You have to address that girls do play feminist card when it comes to a subject of punishment against her wrong doing...

3) Most of the feminist movement destroyed by females only...Me Too movement was destroyed by women themselvesa specially upper class women with blue collor and whote collor job  by sometimes accusing wrongfully...as if lower class and poor hard working women living paycheck to paycheck can't be part of ME TOO movenent 

And also tgere are many you could address!!!!"
Thanks for this knowledgeable and awareness video ❤
We also need to change a lot of legal laws to make them equal. 😅

"Hazrat Umar was interrupted by a woman in the full assembly on this speech and said, ""How are you saying this?""  Whereas Allah says:

                  (Al-Nisaa: 20)
 And if you believe one of them in abundance, do not take anything from it.

                 When God has made it permissible that the husband can give even one quintar as dowry, then who are you to forbid it?  Hazrat Umar heard this and said: You are all more knowledgeable than Umar.  This woman's freedom of opinion was not undermined as to why Hazrat Umar was criticized and objected to;  Because Hazrat Umar's conversation was about priority and virtue.  Self was not justified.

                 This proves that women have full right to their freedom of opinion;  Even Islam gave slave women the right to have their own free opinion.  And it had become so common that the Arab slave-girls used to act on it without any hesitation.  used to offer and they did not feel any danger or disobedience. (20)

Part (final)"
Legends know he changed title and thumbnail 🤠
I am proud to be a Muslim... islam prohibits feminism... islam says it is the responsibility of men to care and feed women...and women are advised to be in homes
"thank you Dhruv sir for telling people what feminism actually means, as a feminist person myself it always irritates me how people misunderstand a feminist person as a misandrist or man-hater. I hope this video educates that misunderstood section of the society."
17:38 It wasn't Raja Ram Mohan Roy who fought against Sati.. It was William Carey.. Make a video on him after researching. People should know the truth.
"The same moral of budha, i saw rahul Gandhi saying it.
Rahul Gandhi is really the most ethical and moral political leader."
"(4) The right to property: In this way, whatever property a woman gets from dowry and inheritance, she owns it completely;  Because he does not have any financial responsibility;  Rather she receives from all;  So all this is safe with him.  If a man wishes, he has a double share in the inheritance;  But it has to be spent on the woman in every situation, so in this way the financial condition of the woman (in the Islamic society) becomes so stable that sometimes she is in a better condition than the man.

                 (5) Then she spends her wealth wherever she wants, no one has authority over it, whether she gives it to her husband or her children or gives it to someone else or gives it in the way of God, it is her own will and if  If she earns by herself, then she is the owner;  But her maintenance is obligatory on her husband, whether he earns or not.  In this way, the economic right given by Islam makes the woman so strong that no matter how much the woman is grateful;  While women are completely deprived of these economic rights.

Civil rights

                  Choice of husband: In relation to the choice of husband, Islam has given a large degree of freedom to women.  In connection with marriage, the will of the girls and their permission has been declared essential in every situation.  The Prophet said:

                 A married woman should not be married unless she is consulted, and a virgin should not be married without her permission. (13)

                 If someone has been married in childhood, the girl's will is not included in it when she becomes an adult, then she has the right to reject this marriage, in such a case no one can force her.

                 Yes, if a woman wants to marry a person who is immoral or against her family, then in such a case the saints will definitely intervene.

 Right to eviction

                  Islam has given the right of divorce to the woman, that if the husband is unfaithful and incompetent, the wife can annul the marriage and these rights are granted through the court.

 Right to good society

                 It is commanded in the Qur'an: Be kind to women (Al-Nisa': 19). Therefore, the husband is instructed to treat his wife with kindness and generosity.  There are those who are good towards their wives and treat their families with pleasure and kindness.

The social position of women in the eyes of Islam

                 The social position of women in Islam is so high that it can be inferred from the fact that in the matter of socializing, Allah Ta'ala specifically addresses men and orders that in the matter of socializing with them, ""  to be considered ""well-known"";  So that they behave well in every aspect of society and in everything.  It is said that:

                 (Al-Nisa': 19)
  And live with these women in good company, if you dislike them, then it is possible that you dislike something and Allah will put a lot of good in it.

                  Society means living together, in this sense, Allah Almighty has ordered men to live together with women in the Holy Quran.  The second is that it has been tied to the ""known"", and living a known life means that one should be very polite and polite in conversation, be gentle and loving in one's words, not be bossy and listen to one thing with attention and  Don't be disrespectful, and don't show any sense of humor. (19)

Right to freedom of opinion

                 In Islam, women have the same right to freedom as men, whether it is a religious or worldly matter.  He has every right to exercise his opinion freely like a man within religious boundaries.

                 On one occasion, Hazrat Umar said: ""You people are warned not to over-tie the dowry of women. If over-tying the dowry was magnificence from the point of view of the world and it was a matter of piety in the eyes of Allah, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)  would have been more deserving. (Tirmidhi)

"It is a very difficult and delicate task to deduce issues and give fatwas in the light of the Qur'an and Hadith;  But still women were not behind in this field;  Rather, they were opponents of the Companions of the Prophet, some of whom are mentioned.  For example:

                 Hazrat Aisha, Hazrat Umm Salama, Hazrat Umm Atiya, Hazrat Safiya, Hazrat Umm Habiba, Asma bint Abu Bakr, Umm Sharik, Fatima bint Qais, etc. were prominent.

Social field

                 Just as other societies tried to eradicate women from life like a thorn, on the contrary, Islamic society has given her more priority and honor than men in some situations.  The person who came as a mercy to the world (Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace) announced the following message to this oppressed class:

                 I love woman and fragrance among the things of the world and the coolness of my eye is placed in prayer.

                 This proves that disgust and hatred of women is not an argument for piety and piety, a person can be beloved of God when he appreciates all the blessings of God with which He has blessed His servants, His order and beauty.  Be desirous of and treat women properly.  This is the reason why marriage has been made obligatory for both men and women.

                 Marriage is my sunnah, whoever turns away from my sunnah has nothing to do with me. (10)

                 Therefore, a woman as a wife is the queen of her husband's house and the teacher and mentor of his children.  It is stated in the Holy Quran:

      (Al-Baqarah: 187) Women are your clothes and you are theirs.

                 It means that the personality of both of you is completed by each other.  You are a source of beauty and beauty for them, and they are a source of beauty and adornment for you. There are many thirsty aspects in the life of both of them, which do not reach completion without each other. (11)

Economic rights

                 Respect in society depends on economic status.  The one who has perfect wealth, people look at him with respect and the one who does not have it, people do not even bother to pass near him, respect is a distant thing.  All the societies and systems of the world kept women economically weak, except Islam, then this economic weakness became the cause of her oppression and poverty.  Western civilization wanted to cure this oppression of women.  And forced the women out of the house and put them to work in factories and other places.  In this way, women earning outside the home became the cause of many other problems, in these situations Islam is the only religion that took the path of moderation.

                 (1) The non-maintenance of a woman is the responsibility of a man in every situation.  If there is a daughter, it is the responsibility of the father.  If it is a sister, it is the responsibility of the brother, if it is a wife, then the husband is obligated to pay for it, and if it is a mother, then its expenses are the responsibility of her son.

            (Al-Baqarah: 236)
 A prosperous man should give sustenance according to his ability and a poor man according to his ability.

                 (2) Dowry: It is obligatory on the man to pay the woman's right to dowry.  Allah Ta'ala says in the Holy Qur'an:

                 (Al-Nisaa: 4)
 Pay the dowry of women with pleasure, if they forgive you some part of it with their pleasure, then eat it with pleasure and relish.

                 (3) Inheritance: According to some religions, women have no right to inherit;  But unlike these religions and societies, Islam gave women a regular share in inheritance.  (Al-Nisa': 11) That is, a woman's share is half that of a man, (the reason for which is not the occasion to explain) in the same way, she is entitled to a regular inheritance from her father, husband, children, and other close relatives.

"I think we men have stopped taking dowry but after divorce women r taking a handsome compensation amount as they are getting legal support ,so I think dat is d side effects of feminism"
"No doubt
Nakli feminists harm females whereas nakli patriarch harms  males. So taste the Flavour of hypocrisy and contribute to Bring Equality."
"When women declare that we are superior to men, that we do not need them, that men should weep, and other such statements, it is not about feminism; rather, it is extreme feminism.
The second issue is that women seek equal representation in higher positions, which is incorrect in and of itself because employers only choose hardworking individuals; women are not qualified for such positions.
Third, men and women are not the same; men are taller, faster, and stronger than women. Men perform all the physical labor in the world, including building houses, roads, bridges, mining for minerals, producing gas and other earthly oils, and engaging in sports.  

The fourth is that women ought to acknowledge that men are the world's providers and guardians."
Dhruv Rathee is such a hypocrite
"dhruv bhai !! ek video ka idea hain mere pass : Identification of modern day Chapri, so that we can turn around and walk in the opposite direction whenever we see one."
"Remember the time when the girl who was buried alive will be asked for what crime she was killed.

                 On the one hand, the promise of hell was announced for the cruelty and abuse done to these innocent people, on the other hand, the good news of heaven was given to these people.  May the Jinns be free from this cruelty and treat girls the same as they treat boys and do not make any difference between the two.  Therefore, Hazrat Abdullah Ibn Abbas says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that whoever has a daughter should neither bury her alive, nor treat her with contempt, nor should he prefer his son over her.  Allah will admit him to Paradise (4).

 Woman as a human being

                 The first favor Islam did to women was that it changed the thinking and mentality of both men and women about the personality of women.  Determined the position, rank and dignity of woman in the heart and mind of man.  He fulfilled the duty of his social, cultural, and economic rights.  In the Qur'an it is said:

                 (Al-Nisaa: 1)

                 Allah created you from a human (Hazrat Adam) and made him his wife.

                 Therefore, men and women are equal in being human.  Here, for a man, his masculinity is not something to be proud of, nor is his femininity a source of shame for a woman.  Here both men and women are dependent on man and man is the great masterpiece of nature in terms of his creation and attributes.  Who is the most respected person in the entire universe in terms of his qualities and characteristics.  It is stated in the Qur'an that:

                 (Surah Bani Israel: 70)

                 We gave the children of Adam greatness and honor and gave them a ride for dry land and dry land.  He gave them sustenance of pure things and gave them superiority over many things among His creatures.

                 And he said in Surah Altin

                 We created human in the best shape and form.

                 Therefore, Adam was given superiority over all the creatures and the woman has an equal share in the honor given as a human being. (5)

Women's right to education

                 Human progress depends on knowledge. Any person or nation without knowledge is left behind in the process of life.  And because of his dull mind, he cannot think much ahead in the stages of life, nor does he see any possibility of material progress;  But despite this, a long period of history has passed in which the need and importance of knowledge for women was ignored and its need was considered only for men and even among them, those belonging to a certain class only got that knowledge.  used to do and the woman used to live a life of ignorance far away from knowledge.

                 But Islam declared knowledge as a duty and opened its doors for both men and women and removed all obstacles and restrictions. Islam gave special attention to the education and training of girls and encouraged it.  As the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Seeking knowledge is a duty.

                 Whoever has three daughters, then they are educated and married, and good to them, they are destined for Paradise (6).

                 He who brings up three girls, educates them, marries them and treats them well (even afterwards), then for him will be Paradise.

                 Islam addresses both men and women and has made everyone bound by worship, ethics and Shari'ah, which is not possible without knowledge.  Without knowledge, a woman can neither protect her rights nor fulfill her responsibilities that Islam has imposed on her;  Therefore, the education of men as well as women is very important.

                 Just as knowledge spread among men in the past, it also spread among women.  Among the Companions, women who have knowledge in the Qur'an and Hadith are found in sufficient quantity.

Bhai modiji feminist hai kya triple talak htane ke liye?
"By: Nagmah Parveen, Research Scholar
 Department of Theology, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh
                 History is a witness that women have been oppressed for a long time.  In Greece, in Egypt, in Iraq, in India, in China, in every nation in every region, there was no such place where the mountains of oppression against women did not break.  People used to buy and sell it for their luxury and they were treated worse than animals;  Even the people of Arabs considered the existence of women as a source of shame and used to bury girls alive.  In India, the husband's widow was burnt on the pyre.  Vaishnava religions considered women as the source of sin and the door of iniquity and the embodiment of the papacy.  Belonging to him was considered a hindrance to spiritual progress.  In most of the civilizations of the world, it did not have a social status.  He was looked down upon.  She had no economic and political rights, she could not freely transact.  She was submissive to her father, then to her husband, and then to her male children.  He had no will of his own, nor did he have any power over anyone;  He didn't even have the right to cry.

                  There is no doubt that at times the power has been in the hands of a woman and the government and empire have been circulating on her cues, thus she dominated the family and the class;  But on some issues, a woman had supremacy over a man, there are still tribes where women have the upper hand;  But as a woman, her situation did not change much, her rights continued to be encroached upon and she remained the oppressor of the oppressed. (1)

                 But Islam is a religion that has done great favor to woman and brought her out of the pits of humiliation and humiliation when she had reached the extremes of it, she was being refused even to acknowledge her existence, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)  Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, came as the mercy of the worlds and he saved the entire humanity from this fire and also took the woman out of this pit.  And give immense rights to this woman who bury alive and what is the importance of women in the national and national life, and entrust her with the responsibilities according to her nature.

                 Western civilization also gives women some rights;  But not as a woman;  Rather, it honors him when he is ready to take on the responsibilities of being an artificial man;  But the religion called by the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gives her all the honors and rights as a woman, and has imposed on her the same responsibilities that nature has entrusted to her (2).
Usually the weak have to work hard to get their rights.  Then they go somewhere and get their legitimate rights, otherwise it is not even imagined.  The present era after its discussion, analysis and protest recognized some basic rights of women and this is considered as the grace of this era;  Although this favor belongs to Islam, it first gave women the rights that she had been deprived of for a long time.  Islam did not give these rights because the woman was demanding this;  Rather, because these were the natural rights of a woman and she should have got them.  The position and status of women in the society defined by Islam is free from the absurd traditions of the modern and ancient times, neither is a woman allowed to be oppressed by making her an idol of sin, nor does she have the same freedom as in Europe (3).

                 Here the rights that Islam gave to women are mentioned;  Rather, he also issued an order to pay it through incentives.

Right to keep women alive

                 The situation of women in Arabia was the same in the whole world;  Some Arab tribes used to bury girls.  The Holy Qur'an strongly threatened him and gave him the right to live and said that whoever turns away from his right, God will have to answer him on the Day of Judgment.  He said:

thank you ❤for talking about what a exact meaning of feminism
"Feminism has almost destroyed my life,I was charged with POSH by my coworker just because work from her end was lagging and that delayed our project and because of that I had to face pressure from my manager so I told him about her inability and after 2 weeks she filed Se*ual harrasment charges against me,I was suspended for One and half month,in the end the board didn't found anything solid in favour of her allegations and fortunately my coworkers took my side.
From that day I have stopped even saying Hi to girls.
I'm a Jain,we are taught strictly about how we should behave I can't even think of harassing  any girl even in my dreams because of my upbringing but I was slapped with those charges,it was a nightmare those 45-46 days were horrible.
So guys please stay away from girls in general.
I have full case history with me,from her complaint's copy to my suspension letter to inquiry updates, statements of my coworkers and final verdict of the board and I think I should sue her for defamation but I feel she would easily get away with it looking at past similar cases,Should I file the case?"

"I have a good amount of respect for your contents..Their quality and information is commendable..Which is also applicable to this.
But I beg to differ in this case,
What i understand is patriarchy has a massiive impression in our society even to this day.
But for this to happen there should have been a minimum or almost nil oppostion from the other gender almost through out our history.
This could have only happened if women were ok with patriatchy in the olden days.
So why would women who now want equal rights be ok with their share of rights mostly as homemaker back then.
The most obvious answer I find which most of the modern women would find hard to swallow is back then life was tough.There were no luxurious jobs back then.
Considereing from the early ages where you had to go out in the wild fighting wild animals and all sort of unknowns and bring back food on the table to the ages where war and expansion had left life on uncertainaities.
Until those days no women considered equal rights to be an issue , no one said i'll go to wild and bring food on the table, its my right too or no one said you sit back home look after the kids while I guard our house or fight battles or mend shoes or cut the wood, or go trading to distant unknown lands or go fishing in the stormy oceans..
But suddenly after the barbaric, battle thirsty era, close to the 18th century came the industrial revolution, which along brought new and comfortable jobs in the market.And this is when the word feminism suddenly sprang up.
This is when some women remembered that they had been subjected to cruelty and unfair treatment as a member of society the entire history of human kind.
Well forgive me but this is not feminism i believe it is but obvious opportunitism(if at all theres a word).
If you wanted equality you should have asked for it when the storm was rising not in a sunny lovely morning after it has passed."

"Instead equal rights should be given to men there is reservation everywhere for women
The selection should be based on merit and not on gender
And about people saying about social equality, it will come with time, the mentality 10 years back is not today and will change after 10 years the reservation is only benefited by the upper middle educated class who doesn't work hard enough 
Mentality in villages will change with education and time only and not with reservation"

Disingenu0us is an understatement to define ththis video. Same with all left piigs so passionate about holding men accountable but all sorts of ment@l gymnastics, excuses to deflect bl@me on t0xic women.

Made an entire video on animal and how t0xic it is yet ""thank you for coming, four more shotss"" in the video which is peak t0xic femini$m is skimmed over and almost not talked about other than a criticism.

preach morality to men, make excuse for t0xic women is the motto of the left , and the moral high ground left piigs have is the funniest of all. what a freaking joke."

Feminism❤❤
Being a feminist, I always had heated arguments with some of my acquaintances that Feminist means 
""Going against men""
""Giving more power in the hands of woman""
etc.
And I just ignore them after some point cause I know there is no point on wasting time with patriarchy mentality people.
But I know the true sense of being a feminist and I'm proud of it.

In today's era, many of our woman and man don't even know what feminism is.

On the emotions topic
I'm 21 and I do still cry on small things and it makes me feel better sometimes.
I do cry when I'm working hard on something and not getting results but that doesn't demotivate me cause I know it takes time.

I surely hope that someday our people will know the true meaning of FEMINISM cause it takes time but people will understand.

FEMINISM means ""EQUAL RIGHTS OF MAN AND WOMAN"" or ""EQUALITY"".❤❤"

"its not like sigma male people want to discourage feminism, but many women who believe in feminism as women should be superior than men, so that's why we find two sides in social media arguing about non-sense. An intelligent person would never promote a superior men or women society. And it's very much evident that when something injustice is done to men we rarely find feminist supporting them. I feel like the society has a wrong perception about life, almost every one has alter ego '' A will to prove that they are superior and wanting to prove their dominance ''within them that supports them doing these sort of things in life. People need to be socially educated and behave with common sense."

"यह पाठ पुरुष और महिलाओं की संस्थाओं में समानता पर चर्चा करता है, जो कि संस्थाओं के बिना सही नेतृत्व के बिना संचालित नहीं हो सकती है। यह सुझाव देता है कि जैसा कि दो पुरुषों के साथ एक संस्था में, एक को नेता चुना जाना चाहिए, उसी तरह, यदि संस्था में एक महिला शामिल है, तो उसे भी नेता चुना जा सकता है। इसके अतिरिक्त, यह सुझाव देता है कि ऐसे मामलों में, पुरुषों को संस्था के उच्चतम नेतृत्व को स्वीकार करना चाहिए ताकि संस्था का सही संचालन सुनिश्चित हो सके। विवाह को भी इस तरह की एक संस्था के रूप में विचारा गया है, जो परिवारों को एकत्र करता है और इसके स्थिरता के लिए सभी पक्षों का उचित आचरण आवश्यक होता है। पाठ समाप्त होता है जब यह सुझाव देता है कि इस्लाम ने विवाह को एक ऐसा तंत्र निर्धारित किया है जो मानवता की शुरुआत से है और ईश्वर द्वारा मानव संबंधों के उचित प्रबंधन के लिए आज्ञापित है।"
"Can you make video on new laws in india that strongly support women, so much so that they can even miss use them against men?"
@21:31 your so casually saying its the alpha males out there who dont relate feminism with correct movies. How blind or bias do you gotta be to admit and mention that a huge population be it male or female do associate feminism with shows like 4 more shots please?

"The passage discusses the equality of men and women within institutions, arguing that without proper leadership, institutions cannot function effectively. It suggests that just as in an institution with two men, one must be chosen as the leader, similarly, if a woman is part of the institution, she too can be chosen as the leader. Furthermore, it proposes that in such cases, men should accept the leadership of the woman to ensure the proper functioning of the institution. The analogy is extended to marriage, considering it as an institution that brings families together and requires the proper conduct of all parties involved for its stability. The passage concludes by suggesting that Islam has prescribed marriage as a system that has been in place since the beginning of humanity and is ordained by God for the proper management of human relationships."

".if you are a follower of Dhruv Bhai,you are capable of knowing the reality of the society and spread awareness in it."
"I completely agree with every word in this video, there are people spoiling the image of women, and there are people spoiling the image of men, these two groups fight all day try to enrage people into joining them, but there are so many more people who do great things and want to love in this world equally and peacefully, the difference is where you look. Men and women are meant to be equals and friends, not try to constantly prove that one is better than the other."
"I agree whatever dhruv said but the fact is modern feminism is only about hating men, drinking, smoking, wearing short clothes, not having kids, not getting married, etc. Modern Feminism only exists when it benefits them. They want all good things that a man can have but dont want bad things that a man has to face. Feminists never fight to take responsbilities for family, they never fight for men right, they never fight for false r@pe cases that a man has to face, etc. They are fighting for rights which benefits them. Harsh but true."
Your true
"مرد اور عورت کسی ادارے کے بغیر برابر ہیں،
اگر یہ کسی ادارے کا حصہ ہیں تو پھر برابر نہیں ہو سکتے اسلئے ادارے میں کسی ایک کو سربراہ بنانا پڑے گا، مثال کہ طور پر ایک ادارے میں اگر دو مرد ہیں تو دونوں میں سے کسی ایک کو سربراہ بنانا پڑےگا ورنہ ادارہ چل نہیں سکے گا، ایسے ہی اگر عورت ہے اس ادارے میں تو صرف اس کو بھی سربراہ بنایا جا سکتا ہے پھر اُن دونوں مردوں کو اس ایک عورت کی سربراہی قبول کرنی چاہیے تاکہ ادارہ سہی چل سکے۔
ایسے ہی شادی بھی ایک ادارے کو وجود میں لاتی جس سے ایک خاندان کچھ تعلقات وجود میں آتے ہیں۔ یہ ادارہ ایک بچے کی ضرورت ہے۔ اگر اس ادارے میں کوئی بھی اپنا کردار سہی سے ادا نہیں کرے گا تو یہ ادارہ بِکھر جائے گا۔ 
اس لیے اسلام نے یہ شادی جیسا نظام بتایا اور یہ جب سے انسانیت کی ابتدا ہوئی ہے اسی وقت سے ہے اور یہ طریقہ خدا نے بتایا ہے۔"

"An amazing video putting all the points where they should be! I feel a huge problem is not understanding what FEMINISM is at its core. Many people, male or female, don't know the actual meaning of the word and what it means, so a few take advantage of this to promote matriarch under the shadow of feminism..."
"Cool..I agree with all your explanation, but I also wanted to know how women misuse the law. Most of the rape cases registered are not true, and other false accusations are countless. So, I just wanted to know where this falls: feminism or patriarchy?"
""" Modern Research "" 

In recent times, it has been accepted as fact, on a purely academic level, that fundamental, inborn differences do exist between men and women. A detailed article on the status of women in the Encyclopaedia Britannica includes a section on “Scientific Studies of Male-Female Differences.” Here the author points out physical differences in the respective constitutions of the male and female of the human species. “With respect to personality traits,” he writes, “men are characterized by greater aggressiveness, dominance and achievement motivation, women by greater dependency, a stronger social orientation, and the tendency to be more easily discouraged by failure than men.”40 And there are a number of latter-day scientific experiments to back this up. Researchers have found greater dependence and docility in very young girls, greater autonomy and activity in boys. One such experiment was conducted in the U.S. When a barrier was set up to separate youngsters from their mothers, boys tried to knock it down; girls cried helplessly. There are personality differences between the sexes too. Some distinctions turn up remarkably early. At New York University, for example, researchers have found that a female infant stops sucking a bottle and looks up when someone comes into the room; a male pays no attention to the visitor. Scientific researchers almost unanimously agree that hormones help determine how people feel and act. Thus the male-female differences are entirely genetic in nature. The passivity found in women is due to the particular nature of the female hormones. Differences between male and female hormones exist from birth: they are not acquired later, as would be the case if they stemmed from differences in environment. The tenets of Islam are based wholly on nature. This is because Islam is the religion of nature. The laws Islam requires us to follow are, in fact, our own instinctive human requirements expressed in legal terms. And the teachings of Islam with respect to women are no exception. They too are based on nature. Modern, psychological, biological and anatomical research proves women to be more passive than men. This is the way their Maker has fashioned them. The nature of their womanhood, the special part they have to play in society, demand that they should be just as they have been made — that is, relatively delicate as compared to men. It is this fact of nature on which Islamic teachings have been based. Because of women’s delicate constitution, Islam teaches men to be gentle with them. That way they will not lose heart or become too despondent to perform their special duties in life. Women are not like iron and steel ribs: they are fragile and delicate. It is best to let them be, in their natural state. If one treats them as though they were tough metal, one will only break them."
"All the arguments presented here are thoroughly subjective
And pretty shallow 
Objectivity would be appreciated"
Dhruv is the true feminist 😂😊🤚...
Chapri log
"Thanku dhruv.. Clear, precise.. As a woman even I couldn't explain this so intricately.. U r the real hero of human kind!!!"
"Feminism first began with a noble concept of giving women equal rights as men in the society. But now third wave feminism is about giving women power over men. Third wave feminism teaches women that it is empowering to make coffee for your boss but demeaning to do the same for your husband, it teaches that marriage is a symbol of patriarchy and hookup/ promiscuity is a progressive thing, it teaches women to take half of the property of your husband in divorce but give minimum financial/ physical effort in the marriage, it encourages women to hit men but teaches men cannot hit women. It encourages society to make reservations for women in powerful positions like politics/ business but doesn’t encourage women to do dangerous jobs that men did for thousand of years like construction, military…etc. The ultimate goal of third wave feminism is to give women authority of a man, privilege of a woman and accountability of children. 3rd wave feminism should be stopped as soon as possible or else our birth/ marriage rate will fall like Japan, South Korea and other industrialized nations who let this toxic ideology run wild."

Great
Finally legend made a video on a really good topic
Very important  video for all
Make video on diabetes
You simply neglected that for majority of girls feminism means only equal rights for women and not for Men. You can easily find girls on social media defending same gender even if they r wrong but instead You used word chapri ladke and critisized them but continuously neglected other gender role. And btw Boys will be Boys is just a meme like any other meme without making any sense for anyone or taking it seriously.
Very sensible video
Superb
"Dhruv great topic I feel India requires it.
Well researched and agree with almost everything you had to say.
At 10:00 there is this excerpt ""Nature does not create hierarchies..."" 
Which is factually incorrect. Nature creates hierarchies between Species, Genus and Social Groupings.
Infact even societies and companies function out of hierarchies.
We don't know any other system that would work.
Coming to Feminism and Hierarchies, it is more likely due to the woman bearing a child that it becomes difficult for them to rise the corporate ladder so to speak. 
That being said there are extremely driven ambitious women out there who do so, but they would be far and few outliers.
Radical Feminism posits that society is fundamentally structured by a pervasive system of patriarchy. This perspective is considered risky to adopt.
JP has some interesting views on the subject.
Again thank you for your contribution in bringing such topics to the mainstream.
I wish you can create a dialogue too, your monologue game is cracked :)
Cheers"

Male and female are not supposed to compete with each other but to compliment each other. It is this gender competition with creates superiority phobia leading to discrimination. Unfortunately! The origin of discriminations are due to nationality and religion. 😊

very good coverage
how do you know whats an actual ideal women?? regardless of what you say why should I believe you? after all its your subjective morality.  how can you prove if something is ideal without objective morality? who decides whats right and whats  wrong?  the only answer to this is religion and god. if we cannot believe in the texts of our holy books regardless of the  religion we follow then  everything  becomes subjective. you have no right to tell someone that their believe is wrong without objective morality.

"The thing is that when most of the people who talk about Feminism, they talk about pseudo-feminism. This is because of Andrew Tate and some Only Fans Women 😂 but feminism is not that. I before used to think that the definition of Matriarchy was of Feminism. i do not support pseudo-feminism, but if we go by the actual norms of feminism, i am a Feminist."
"Tbh , and I am speaking this purely in terms of  content and presentation, recently it felt to me that Dhruv is making videos either for sponsors, sell his courses or to keep up with the algorithm, which up to some point is understandable but I don’t feel the same warmth which I used to in his initial years on YT. He chose topics of current affairs and politics more often then. Like your senior in college or neighbourhood is telling you, educating you and making you informed. Now it’s feels he is trying to shove the content down our throats. Now his channel is becoming like any other random YT channel making videos about in a manner like “ aao bhai aao maine ye padha / jana hai aur ab tum bhi isey suno” . 

I rather like watching Mohak Mangal’s videos. 

No hate to Dhruv. It’s just my feedback as his subscriber who has been following this channel from a very long time now."

"Logical argument: you said there are only 2-3 body part changes in the male and female body. But nobody can deny the fact that women are not as strong as men you can say give some example to prove me wrong but in 99% of cases my point can be justified, we shouldn't check gender of the person instead check the intelligence and skills.

Dhruv bhai ne consistency gira ke aukaat dikha di😂
"Feminism is the idea to increase tax revenue of the govt. 
Women almost make 50% of the polulation but only 10-12% women used as a work force(means pay taxes) and on the other hand almost 99 % men pay taxes 
The elites want 100% polulation as work force to get more tax ,that is why feminisn is being promoted ."
Hats off Dhruv rathee ❤️

""" A Closer Look "" 

Western women have come out of the house and into the marketplace in full force, but a closer look raises the question as to how much of this is “liberation,” and, even more important, what is its cost in human and social terms for women and for society. In 1990, 53.5 million women, or 58 percent of all American women, were in the labor force — three fourths of them working full time. From 1975 to 1990, 20 million women had been added to the work force. Labor force participation of all women between 16 and 65 years of age rose dramatically, but the steepest increase was among married women with a husband present in the home. In 1990, nearly 60 percent of all married mothers with children under six years of age were working outside the home. In 1980 less than 20 percent of married mothers with toddlers under three years of age were fulltime workers; by 1990 more than 33 percent of these mothers were in the work force. Though women have made substantial advances in professional, technical and administrative-management occupational areas, they are still overwhelmingly employed in the administrative support occupations, including clerical and secretarial jobs, and services (such as sales-girls, waitresses, hairdressers, etc.). In 1975, only 5.2 percent of employed females were in executive, administrative or management occupations, whereas by 1990 this had grown to 11.1 percent. Similarly, in 1975, 13.2 percent of employed women worked in the traditional professions (i.e., as physicians, lawyers, registered nurses), and 2.7 percent worked in technical and related professions but, by 1990 this had increased to 15.1 percent and 3.5 percent respectively. In 1975, 63.7 percent of female employees were confined to four areas — namely, sales, administrative support, private household and other service occupations. In 1990 58.6 percent of employed women still worked in these fields. So, although women in America are now 13.9 percent of all police and detectives, 19.3 percent of all physicians, 36 percent of all computer programmers, 43.5 percent of all manufacturing assemblers, 44.3 percent of all financial managers and 51.5 percent of all bus drivers, they are also 99 percent of all secretaries, 89.2 percent of all textile sewing machine operators, 84.8 percent of all health aides and 80.8 percent of all waitresses. Among government employees, though women are a minority at the highest grade levels, their representation there has been increasing sharply. For instance, in 1982, 22.4 percent of the employees in Grades 11-12 and only 9.7 percent in Grades 13-15, were women. By 1988, 31.9 percent of Grades 11-12 employees and 15.9 percent of Grades 13-15 employees were women. Still, the bulk of women in government employment are concentrated at the six lowest grades. In 1982, and still in 1988, fully 75 percent of the employees in the lowest six levels were women. Though the pay gap between men and women has closed somewhat, and more so in some occupations than in others, discrimination in earnings and benefits remains pervasive. In 1980 women earned, on average, 64 cent for every dollar earned by men in the United States; by 1990 it was 72 cents. In certain areas, such as technical, sales, administrative support and service jobs, the male-female wage gap narrowed in recent years as much because of declines in men’s salaries (due to recession condition) as of increases in women’s wages. As of 1989, women were still more likely than men to be working at minimum wage jobs. Female workers were less likely than males to have employer or union-sponsored pension plans in 1987 (but between 1980 and 1987 the proportion of male workers with pension plans dropped by 6 percentage points). In spite of the fact that nearly half the American work force consists of women, neither maternity/paternity leave nor childcare support was by any means the norm in American firms, even in 1989. At that time, no more than 3 percent of medium and large size firms, on average, provided paid maternity leave, and this went down to 2 percent for small firms (with less than 100 employees). In 1988, more than 60 percent of American children under age 18 had working mothers, but as far as childcare assistance is concerned, no more than 10 percent of firms of all sizes provided any real benefits or support for childcare. However, 35-45 percent of all firms did provide flexible schedules and flexible leave times for parents with young children. “Flexitime” notwithstanding, in 1987 6.2 million working mothers in America paid for childcare. Of these 750,000 had incomes at or below the poverty line, and for them childcare expenses ate up 20 percent of their income. Though mothers with children under age 21 and no father present are entitled to government child support, often they do not get it at all or do not get the full amount. Closely related to the issue of women’s earnings and benefits in the fact that between 1970 and 1989 the number of women workers of age 16 and above holding multiple jobs increased by almost 400 percent — from 636,000 to more than 3 million. Women who worked more than one job in 1989 were more likely than men to be doing so because the additional earnings were necessary to meet regular household expenses."

For eg they would never lift a chair for man never pull a door for them even the shayaris that are made are only on girl where is a good shayri for men ,  who gives compliments to boys . The number is very less the equality should be equally distributed 😅😅😅"
Jab girls exactly men jesi ho jyegi so what's the point of 2 genders in this world. It means one of them is useless? being married or be with a girl? There is some natural differences which is beautiful. Don't get brainwashed. Equality is different but being dumb and different just forcefully to prove a point is stupidity. Be yourself how you are naturally.  Pregnant wali bat sari females deti bs ek yahi argument hai unke pas. Toh ap bina men k bache paida karlo. Aur pregnant ho bhi jao toh who will protest you for 9 months pregnancy. You need special protection for 9 months. That's men job. Without his sperm you can't do it. Nature has given roles to each gender. Don't foolishly get brainwahsed by feminism. Both should get equal rights but they have their own limits.

""" Unnatural Equality "" 

Selected readings from the Qur’an were prepared in English by the English Orientalist, Edward William Lane, and were first published in London in book form in 1843. In his foreword, Lane wrote that “the fatal point in Islam was the degradation of woman.” Since then this remark has been regularly taken up as a stick with which to beat Islam. In fact, whenever Islamic affairs were mentioned, it became such a common observation, that not only the enemies of Islam, but also relatively fair-minded writers such as the historian, J.M. Roberts, who did justice to Islam in pointing out its virtues, mentioned it as if it were an established fact. We have shown in detail, at another point in this book, that this allegation is entirely baseless. The facts are quite the reverse. Islam has, in actual fact, raised the status of woman. If the truth were told, woman’s degradation has come about at the hands of two major civilizations, one ancient and polytheistic, the other modern and atheistic. The former has been culpable both in theory and in practice, while the latter has been so in practice, despite it’s theorizing to the contrary. We must never lose sight of the fact that what governed the ethics and lifestyles of ancient polytheistic civilizations were myths. Certain highly fanciful, but obviously baseless suppositions were believed in as truths, and all aspects of human existence were subordinated to them. For instance, ancient man regarded certain natural phenomena, such as the sun and the moon, with the awe of ignorance, and venerated them as deities. Conversely, he supposed certain other phenomena to be inferior, therefore, undeserving of respect. It was into the latter category that women fell, possibly because menstruation and their inability to fight alongside their men folk were interpreted in an adversely superstitious manner. Woman was regarded as the inferior sex and, therefore, deserving of degrading treatment by men. Modern western civilization has hardly produced a better result in ostensibly exalting the status of women. It may have pronounced men and women equal in every respect and decreed that all work that can be done by a man can be done by a woman too: it may have encouraged women to come out of their homes and try to find a position equal to a man’s in every department of life (hence the slogan, “Don’t make coffee, make policy”); but, in practice, this concept of equality has done more to degrade women than any traditional view could have done. The next chapter deals with this topic in detail. What is the reason then for this state of affairs? The reason, to put it briefly, is the erroneous concept of absolute equality in western countries. For example, equality between men is held to be an indisputable fact. But if this equality between men is taken to mean that in every field every man can compete with every other man, the upholder of such an unnatural concept should be able to take an Einstein to a boxing ring and expect him to put up a good fight against the heavyweight champion. Conversely he would also expect the boxer to be able to hold his own while presiding over international, scientific conferences. This may seem laughable, but that is what absolute equality would mean. The Einstein who was at the top of the list in university or science conferences would be seen as a sadly inferior person in a bout with a boxer and the boxer would be completely out of his depth at the conference table. It is clear that applying this rule of equality would result in disaster. True equality mean equality not in the workplace but in status. Human equality does not mean that every man should be engaged in the same work as everyone else. It means rather that every man should be looked upon with the same respect, and should be able to expect the same treatment, legally and morally. The error into which the West has fallen is its attempt to establish an unnatural equality in the workplace for men and women. The result is as might have been expected: the greatest inequality in human history has developed between men and women. If men and women are of two different sexes, it is because they were created to serve separate purposes. Place them in their respective fields and they will be equally successful, although in different ways. Place both men and women in the same field, and the women will fail to excel: the men will do better due to their natural abilities. As a result, the women will suffer a fall in status vis-à-vis the men. Inspired by false notions of equality, a certain country girl once fled her home to seek an independent life in a city intending to make money as men do. She failed, however, to find a place in the world of men. What remained at her disposal now was her femininity. This she traded for an independent life. This independent life was not, however, gained by securing “equality” in social life; it was gained rather by having condescended to become the plaything of men. Somewhat similar, but on a larger scale, has been the case of western women. The West encouraged women to come out of their homes to earn like men. They did so only to find that it was impossible to have an independent life by working like men in the outside world. The only alternative available to them to making money was their femininity. Like the country girl who fled her home, they had to sell their femininity in the market place. Such unnatural and immoral acts failed to give women an equal status. This resulted rather in the creation of innumerable new problems. One of them is pornography, which is not a separate problem in itself, but the inevitable result of unrestricted freedom having given way to licence."

""" Women in Modern Civilisation "" 

Where modern western man fell deeply into error, was in his blind acceptance of the concept of the equality of the sexes without giving due consideration of what equality — in its best sense -— ought to mean, or what in practice it entails. According to modern thinking, giving equal status to women meant bringing them out of their homes and standing them face to face with men in all facets of life without any regard for the practical and moral problems which might ensue. Islam, on the other hand, defines separate roles, and, therefore, separate spheres of work for men and women, since it is natural and realistic to do so. The other great error made by modern western thinkers was to assume that a role which was separate and different, and played out in other than traditionally masculine strongholds, was necessarily of trifling importance — in short, inferior. As such, the West concluded that in giving a separate role to woman Islam gives them an inferior position. Conversely, since it is held in the West (in theory) that women must be given a place in all masculine spheres it is also concluded that the West gives her a superior position. So modern man imagines that his feminine counterpart has, in actuality, been accorded a superior position. But let us examine what, in fact, is the state of women’s affairs. In the societies of the West, which have attained a high level of material development, theory has yet to be put into practice, and men and women still live and work in their own very separate domains. The status of women is, in practice, almost the same as it was in ancient times, there still being mutually exclusive divisions into male and female spheres, with the corresponding attitudes still very much in evidence. If this were not so, what need would there be for “women’s lib?” Fourteen hundred years ago, Islam launched a much-needed “women’s lib” movement, whose purpose was to free women from artificial curbs, and to give them the position which any normal human being should have in society. (One instance, for example is to give them a share in family property). This movement raised their status without any sacrifice of femininity or traditional values, and without creating any perversion in society. Having launched its movement under the guidance of revelation, its Islamic exponents were in no doubt as to what limits should be set to societal change. The West, however, in its preoccupation with modernity, plunged headlong into experimentation with the old order of values, sweeping away traditional moral precepts and “restrictive” conventions. All of this was done under the banners of “reason,” “empiricism,” “logic,” “liberalism,” and so on, but, in actual fact, the whole “liberation” movement has been swamped in a welter of emotion, creating a number of social problems."

"1.
Funniest thing is those who tell feminist movement / female rights are the people who told female should be open in mind and body... 😂😂😂

(meaning  the clothes which we see in America , western countries  and many other countries too)

2.
The reason why they don't support matriarch because they saw when a woman become The Ruler (Matriarch )
they become even cruel then (Patriarch ) Male Ruler.*

[* Don't have to believe me. Just Google it.]

3.
When matriarch don't work they come with feminism.  Many people support it(some men). Some thought it is right for woman. They don't know (or they know) to wear shorts , bikini, etc clothes. Many countries research says that the reason rape happened because of female's clothes and po*n. 

And many of us already see what happened in a movie called (Hit : 2nd case) . The so called feminism. 

But I am not supporting the movie called( Animal or any work of Mr.Sandeep). It just a  entertainment. 

¤☆☆☆☆☆
 ask Google how many male and woman (%) cheat  their  partner.  
And also compare previous years also. And you will see 40% INDIAN woman cheat on their male partner . That means around 4/10 women have affair with other men. And the female feels pleasure doing it. They don't feel any regrets. SHOCKING NEWS 
Up until now if anything happened male is sololy made this Sin now .....




4.
(Both movie tell us current situation in the world.)
( And I don't support Patriarch which tells woman have no right or give male every opportunity. Because in my family even female do job.)

5. 
We believe in equal rights. But that doesn't mean one should wear shorts dress or bikini, dance in club etc. This applies for male too.

6.
I am not saying I am more knowledgeable than Mr.Dhrub . But I can't trust people (American and western) who told  about feminism and say woman have to wear bikini. 
Sorry but I can't accept feminism movement."

""" Women's Status in Islam "" 

In ancient times, thanks to the unreasoning and unreasonable approach fostered by superstition, speculation and other forms of irrational thinking, woman came to be considered inferior, one distressing result of which was that she was deprived, among many other things, of the right to inherit property. She was not even entitled to a share of family property. How great an incapacitating factor this was may be judged from the neglect and degrading treatment which women had to suffer for centuries. It was not until the advent of Islam, that, for the first time in the history of mankind, women were given their due legal rights over property. The famous historian J.M. Roberts writes: Its coming was in many ways revolutionary. It kept women, for example, in an inferior position, but gave them legal rights over property not available to women in many European countries until the nineteenth century. Even the slave had rights and inside the community of the believers there were no castes nor inherited status. This revolution was rooted in a religion which -— like that of the Jews — was not distinct from other sides of life, but embraced them all.5 The same point has been made about ancient India by a retired Chief Justice of the Delhi Court, Mr. Rajindar Sachar: ... Historically, Islam had been very liberal and progressive in granting property rights to women. It is a fact that there were no property rights given to Hindu women until 1956, when the Hindu Code Bill was passed, whereas Islam had granted these rights to Muslim women over 1400 years ago.6 This is not, however, just a matter of anteriority. What is significant is that, in granting women equal status and their proper rights, Islam set up an important precedent which had as far-reaching m effect on the civilization of the times as western civilization has lad on the world of today. If Islam was able to accomplish such an ‘evolution in human affairs, it was because it did not remain just a philosophical creed, but went on to conquer most parts of the inhabited world of the times. In the world of today, even those commentators who generously acknowledge the virtues of Islam often repeat the dictum that Islam has relegated women to an inferior status. But to say that Islam gives women a share in property and then to say at the same time that Islam has degraded women is contradictory. From ancient times till today, the question of inheritance has been the most important social issue, and might well be considered the sole criterion of status in society. Entitling women to have a share in property, contrary to the custom of the time, is a clear proof that Islam had no desire to degrade them. Had this been so, the first demonstration of this desire would have been to deprive them of their share in property, a correct and justifiable practice according to the traditions of the times. It is interesting to see the reverse side of the coin as presented by a recent convert to Islam, namely, the English pop singer, Cat Stevens, now known as Yusuf Islam. Asked by a Jewish woman how he intended to deal with the problem of Islam’s “degradation” of women, he said that he had not actually made a study of women’s status in Islam, but that for his own part, he had, since his conversion, asked his mother to come and stay with him and that he loved looking after her. His relations with his wife had also considerably improved. In its assessment of the status of women, the western mind has made the same error as was made by ancient man: it has formed opinions based on irrational beliefs. This accounts for latter-day distortions of thought regarding women in the advanced western countries and for the resultant grave distortion in the concept of women."

PUR INDIAN LAWS ARE JUST FOR FEMALE...WE MALE HAVE TO SUFFER A LOTS ...WE WILL NEVER MARRY AN INDIAN GIRL...I WILL MARRY AN FOREIGNER GIRL...
Well u said No femenist supported the girl who slapped a boy and Neha Dhupia. It's true. But they didn't oppose as well. Only boys were opposing them. But if it were a reverse case then feminists would have started barking and boys would also take action against those boys. That's the difference between men and women. The fact is every single women supports a women even if she's wrong. But men don't do the same. And for more Watch Andrew Tate.

"I have one question if anyone here can answer. Let's turn back the clock to the time of hunters-gatherers, when times were tough at that time roles of males and females were fixed Right? What do you think feminism meant then? Let's move a little ahead in history, Agricultural revolution. Most of the farmers were men, doing hard labour in extreme weather. What do you think feminism meant then? Roles were fixed back then also right? Do you think anyone would have raised their voice that women should also get equal work at the farm? Now further ahead in time, Industrial revolution. A little better time, but still livelihood involved working with heavy and dangerous machines. We can safely say feminism had made a slight entry by this time, only a little bit it was there. Now, coming to the modern day world, when earning a living is mostly non dangerous. If you talk about the office jobs. And coincidentally now only we see this feminism movement in full swing. And note that there are still dangerous jobs today also, but equality is demanded only in the places of power, fame and non dangerous jobs. Now why is that? If the whole world is run at the ground level by men, if it's men who are responsible for maintaining and running this entire infrastructure at its core(whether it's sewage, electrical wirings, construction, oil refineries etc etc), then how can there be equality at the top."
"Dhruv Rathee are you aware that you are promoting Divorce in the society. So after going through your video, we may conclude that our traditions and the Ramayan are totallly wrong. All the Rishis of India are wrong according to you. Do your home work first before creating a video."

"It’s confusing, we categorize racists as people who discriminate based on race but everyone else is just considered normal. There’s no anti-racist identity. Similarly, everyone who doesn’t believe in equality of gender is termed sexist or misogynist, and everyone else is just normal. What’s the use of the term “feminist” ? by that logic we should have specific terms for everyone who believes in equality of race, social status, sexual orientation and everything else."

"dhruv you're right i respect you but here's a point that is not acceptable that ""men and women are equal,but men and women can't actually be equal 
Nature has designed us with different roles 
in a relationship when a men become little submissive and female become masculine then, the balance between the relationship is no more ,only if you're a real men coz im not saying women should live under men but atleast they have to do theirs roles and and men their roles,and when they both perform their roles they'll become insane and can achieve big things ,so f@k being saying men and women are equal"" that not f'*ing correct"
"A great information packed video about most trending debating issue. Head's of to you and your team and your hard work for present a engaging video like this.
Keep it up."
Aap ki video bohot achi lagti hai anphad bhi samjhta hai
I'm a fan of this man but I still want to say that men and women are different and not equal even the religious scripture and books says that
"Why begging for reservation then???? 
Why reservation in jee why fake rape cases why why and why. 

Now society is not equal it's more towards females wale up!!!! And see the reality. 
Mens are victims now if you see the rape cases then why don't you see count of fake rape cases it's also a same punishable offence. 

People have created a thought that women's don't have equal rights but they have more rights. Everywhere they get reservation why!!!???? 
Do they don't have aukaat to struggle and get it??"
"In reality women have more rights then men,"

"Feminism is not what Men decide- what is the right way for the woman! 
- Gender rights would be realise best interests only if woman don't follow the corporate career life to fit on the lines of Man's world.
- Though they are struggling despite the glass ceiling still just like men earlier- they will take the routes to leave their children, drink & abuse, retreat from the mainstream society... but the thing is Men should not decide their path of equality. That is when, true freedom will be said to occur. 
- Because ""Social Order when spoonfed becomes restriction amd deviance is measured in little things.""
- Indian Society: Caste flexible conservative patriarchial North and caste-rigid, flexible- Patriarchal South. Women face worst kind of life in North India. 
- Only little freedom is enjoyed by poor and the rich women while the Middle class is intensely controlling. Also apart from class, in caste lower caste women enjoy more frredom.
This freedom sociologically is seen in ""free to work"" and ""sexuality""- among the rich and poor households/ lower castes. 
Mainstream intellectual class which is usually middke class would call this disorder but its Not. Middle classes don't count when it comes to women as Sati, parda system has been their forte. Rest of the monetary issues like dowry or child marriage is again the poor man's choice or the rich man's strategic/ buiz/ political relation building."
can someone say the takeaways from this video pls?
Very right brother ❤
"male or female me differences:
* reproductive organs : different hain
* physical strength & resilience : males are better here
* aesthetics : females are better here
* psychological differences : this is non metric parameter, but both show vast differences & strong similaties psychologically in different situations 
* strategic, spatial & analytic skills : males are better here
* arts : this is non metric parameter but both are equal here
* sympathetic behaviour : females are better here

total score: 5 each
so try to compliment & suppliment other gender rather than burning out in competition...

competition is a low mental status trait, humans unlike animals can arrive to optimum & best solutions without competition 😎
evolution has accidentally invented HUMAN BRAIN which is capable of eliminating competition stress put on by nature...😋"
Still some huge number of men in India and their families are dependent on dowry 🙂
bohot shandaar video banayi hai esse hee videos banaya karo full support karunga
Very nicely explained. Really appreciate it. Kindly differentiate between the issues related to equal Opportunities and Equal laws. Isn't it true that dark side of Feminism is boosted due to current Law system in our country. Kindly clarify this 🙏
"Femist be like we don't need mens 
We are always on top than mens in every field (but actualy they are not i can argue....) And also they want reservation in every exam and job why so is that equality??"

""" Baneful Effects of Deviation "" 

Any deviation from the divine balance established by God leads to chaos and confusion. It is, therefore, laid down in the Qur’an that no changes should be made in the balance God has created by means of His laws of reform.17 One example of universal balance is the fixity of the distance between the sun and earth (about 90 million miles). This distance is extremely balanced, ensuring a whole range of temperatures on earth which is favorable to the continuance of the human species. If this balance were upset in any way, it would result in all kinds of disasters. For instance, if the distance between the sun and the earth were reduced by half, temperatures would rise to such extremes, that everything and everyone on the surface of the earth would be reduced to ashes. There would be no possibility of life existing in any form whatsoever. The same applies to the girth of our planet. Its present circumference is about 25,000 miles, but if this were reduced by half, the pull of its gravity would be so weakened that we should all go flying off into space. If, on the contrary, the circumference were doubled, the effect of gravity would be so overwhelming that all growth would cease. Man would be reduced to the size of a mouse and a mouse would be little bigger than an ant. The unparalleled balance that exists on earth is aptly illustrated by the strange example of the insects which, unlike human beings, do not possess lungs, but breathe through tubes. When insects grow large the tubes cannot grow in ratio to the increasing size of the body of the insect. Hence there never has been an insect more than a few inches long with a slightly longer wing spread. Because of the mechanism of their structure and their method of breathing, there never could be an insect of great size. This limit in their growth held all insects in check and prevented them from dominating the world. If this physical check had not been provided, man could not exist. Imagine a man meeting a hornet as big as a lion or a spider equally large.18 Of course, the notion of order in the world has periodically been called into question. A certain western writer has suggested that the gravitational pull of the earth is far greater than is absolutely essential, hence the difficulty one experiences in carrying even a weight of ten kilos. Had it been less, he points out; we should have been able to walk about, carrying a weight with ease. But this objection is ill-founded. It is entirely due to gravity having the pull that it does, that our homes remain firmly fixed to the ground. Had it been less, they would have flown about like kites, and civilization, as we know it would hardly have been possible. It is fortunate that the order of the universe is not in the hands of men. If it were, we should experience intermittent tampering with the immutable laws of nature. Gravity would wax and wane, the earth would move nearer to or further from the sun and, on the pretext that nature had been cruel to insects in fixing the size of their breathing tubes, the said creatures would be encouraged to grow to elephantine proportions, thus filling the whole earth with them. None of these developments would, however, be encouraging to the human species! Luckily, man cannot effect such changes in the universe, since he has no power over its ordering. But he is free to act as he wills in his own world, and the result has been chaos on a grand scale. The extremes to which he has gone are thus referred to in the Qur’an: “Evil appears on land and sea as a result of the (evil) which men’s hands have done.”"
Right
Still some huge number of men in India and their families are dependent on dowry 🙂
What a man! No word to write down anything just i can say bottom to top    knowledge.

"Sadly enough till around 18 mins u seemed sensible and on the right track, then u picked a side by generalizing a group of people chapri meanwhile u missed to explain the 2018 wave of feminism which u gave a total blind eye, and somehow one more thing u conveniently ignored was just 5 yrs back approximately if any women suffered anything whole society would support her for ur ""feminism"" But u can't name one wave where alright they don't support wrong women, but that's just turning a blind eye where was mass support for the guy who suffered?, u have picked an side dhruv which is fine, but don't believe u r unbiased, the movement recently started by men is a necessity and a reality u can ignore it, but it is not stopping."
"Patriarchy and feminism kya hota hai ye saab school me padhana chahiye tabhi men and women ko equal treat kiya jayega.

Thank you dhruv rathee for this video ....celebrities like Neena gupta they genuinely don't understand the meaning of feminism...their cringe reels keep floating on social media ....and audience keep following those statement....fake feminism truly doesn't exist.....how can they judge only with 2 movies
Probably the best video till date 👍🏻
# justice for jee
Word feminism is the main problem who don’t know the definition of feminism will link feminism word with women superiority so word should be “Equalism” to represent gender equality…. 😅
Thats why educated people love you ✨

"Firstly feminism and rights of women are given in Holy book Quran which give women the right of divorce, the right in property of father as well as in husband property, the right of marriage in Nikah first concern should be taken from woman than man, the right of education and in Islam women can also demand salary from their husband for feeding their own babies. Islam give the right to woman to choose whether she wants to live separately with her husband or not and many more"

""" Law of Balance ""

Now let us examine this divine law. In the words of the Qur’an it is the law of balance: “He raised the heaven on high and set the balance that you might not transgress the balance. Give just weight and full measure.”15 The universe is not composed of just one item. It is rather a collection of highly disparate elements. Besides this, each and every one of its components is in motion. Not a single constituent, from the minutest atom to the most gigantic galaxy, can ever for a second remain static. For the precise functioning of this infinitely complex assemblage of moving components, limits in space and time had to be applied so that the different parts did not come into conflict with each other. God, therefore — besides creating all these things — established a systematic balance between them. This principle is known as the “Law of Nature.” Similarly, in the human world — also a vast assemblage of disparate individuals — everyone is in motion. And in order that each should continue on his life’s journey without colliding with his fellow men, it was likewise necessary to establish boundaries, both moral and physical, for all human beings without exception: a balance had to be struck so that there should be no clash between individuals or societies. It is, indeed, this law of nature which has been revealed to humanity through the medium of the prophets. God’s will on this subject is recorded in the Qur’an: “We have sent our Messengers with clear signs and brought down with them scriptures and the scales of justice so that men might deal with fairness.”16 That is to say that God sent a balance of justice in the form of a book through His prophets. This book was supported by arguments and evidence so that people could believe in its authenticity and would not hesitate to order their lives according to this balance, that is, the just law. While the law of balance is inherent in the rest of creation, for man, it has been provided externally through the revelations of this divine book."

""" ORDER OF NATURE ""

Sculpture is an ancient form of art. There is, no doubt, an obvious resemblance between living beings and statues, but if someone were to presume that the concerns of human beings were the same as those of statues and began to study man under the heading of sculpture, what would be the outcome? This method of study would certainly lead to strange conclusions. A carved image has no need of food and drink; therefore, the student of sculpture would naturally assume that arrangements to this effect were not necessary for man either. He would proceed to the assumption that if a statue can be locked inside a room for any length of time, so could a man be put inside a locked room for years without anyone having to worry about him. During the time of the former President of Egypt, Jamal Abdun Nasir, an ancient statue of Abu Simbel, 20 meters high and firmly fixed in the rocks, had to be removed from its place to make way for the construction of a huge dam. This work, undertaken between 1964 and 1966, necessitated the use of special machines which could cut the statue into several pieces so that they could be shifted to a safer place, and then reassembled. Now, on this parallel, the student who views man as a statue, can also, as part of some scheme, start chopping up the human body. Of course, there is no sculptor in this world who would do such a thing. But in another department, that of education, such experts have come into being in modern times as are experimenting with man as if he were a statue, and doing everything to him that could be done to a statue. This branch of knowledge is called “anthropology.” This field of study began at the turn of the 19th century. In the light of data collected on external information regarding the conditions of ancient man, his beliefs, customs, traditions, certain conclusions about human beings in general were arrived at. Religion naturally came within this field of study, necessitating the collection of information on the religions practised by different tribes and communities. Thus a list of the customs which went under the name of religion was produced. A natural outcome of this method of study was that religion came to be regarded as a social phenomenon. That is to say, religion was presented as something which had evolved out of the influences of human myths, customs and social conditions. Religion is essentially a divine truth (a commandment of God), but thanks to the anthropologists’ particular method of study, it has been reduced to a mere artifact of historical accretion. The greatest harm done to religion by this method of study is that in modern times it has been shorn of its credibility, and reduced to insignificance, whereas, as the commandment of God’s religion it had an unassailable authenticity, because it possessed divine credibility in its own right. Every religious statement was accepted as the ultimate statement of a superior being and, as such, worthy of being adhered to. Conversely, when religion is regarded merely as a social phenomenon, all its credibility is dissipated. This can be compared to relegating the science of chemistry to the position of alchemy, or to equating astronomy with astrology. The fact is that this method of study, when applied to religion, is totally wrong. It turns a reality into a non-reality. It is to accord human status to something which is essentially divine. To understand the reality of religion let us peruse this verse of the Qur’an: “Are they seeking a religion other than God’s when every soul in heaven and earth has submitted to Him, willingly or by compulsion? To Him they shall all return.”14 According to this verse, the religion which God desires man to adopt in his daily living is the same divine law which God has imposed upon the entire universe. Religion is the name of this same universal law."

"Why you deliberately ignored the point of reverse sexism? 

A few days ago Maharashtra government announced free higher education for girls whose parents' income is less than 8 lakh per year. Is this right,even from the point of view of women's empowerment (as it is so much discriminatory for boys)?"
Nice selective propaganda again and again.
"This is in need of the hour, I think everyone should understand equal rights and respect individual thoughts. The only problem that I noticed these days is that there are a lot of women who talk in favor of feminism only when they want to pull benefit out of it and then follow old cultural values (opposite to feminism) if they get benefit doing that. Especially indian women are milking out every possible situation acting out as they want but not taking a stand on one thing"

The current scenario is totally different if a married woman want then she can cheat , also ruined husband's life and his family by filing false cases and our legal system is ready to hear woman side without listening man side ."
Mujhe lagta hai ..pehle feminism ka asli matlab feminist logo ko pata hona chahiye . Jyadatar feminist log  feminism ka matlab sirf ladko ko nicha dikhana smjte hai..

Love you bro Best knowledge ☺️❤❤❤❤❤
"Bro big fan of you from Pakistan, I wanna say that your points on equality of male and female are not quite right. Men and Women are same but not equal, a man can work as labour but women cannot, man can work as a great officer but women are less of those kinds. In general men are kings but women are queens. Women cannot built a house , a lighthouse worker , a ship worker . A healthy person can beat a best women karate master ."

Islam is the first religion to give rights to women
"15:39 You mentioned that men imagine their friendship to be like going out and stuff while in a woman's case, they are more emotionally connected with their friends.

Nangapn equality ni hoti bro
"Core arguments of pseudo feminism aren't unaddressed here.
Secondly, emphasis should be on equal treatment, rights, opportunities as well as reservation for women in certain areas, not on equality between men and women in an absolute sense. If equal opportunities provided, they may perform even better than men, then why the fuss of absolute equality!
Thirdly, the mentioned web series, unrelated to feminism; affirmed here. Offcourse they do not promote feminism instead they are creating a different notion or let's say a negative notion of feminism in the society, and that was unaddressed too."
"And most important thing and disturbing also for me that when a woman speaks worse about woman , i can't expect anything from a sigma man but when a woman says these things that she wants to marry a rich guy and don't want to do a job ,i just hate this cause so many people are giving their support to women but they themselves don't want to be independent and thats sad"
bro dhruv are you also suffering from such men’s issue due to feminism? i just basiclly know men living in other country. I also face issues of being short and being man concomitantly.

"Hey Dhruv,
I would like you request you about make video on extremely antimen BNS69 , fake dowry cases, fake rape cases...where sadistic women use law as weapon to torture men and his whole family.
unfortunately 80% of these cases are Fake (courts also admitted this) many men have left with no option but to end his life.🤐

this government and judiciary is working to completely Destroy marriage institutions
and men's life.🥴
if woman caught having extra marital affair husband still have to pay maintenance to her after divorce....WTH is this?
there are many flow in laws.

there are many influencers now spreading awareness on this issue.
please join this movement!!!"
Then why the reservation is only for specific communities. ..even they are all similar as keep to body as keep to structure. Mind and awareness is the biggest difference here ..as I experienced man is more sensitive as compare to women's.
Greatly Explained 👏
"Bro every responsible citizen would always agree with these ideologies but I quit disagree with your example of Gautam Buddha if someone is abusing you and you are not saying anything in response then  you are facing injustice.Also it has became almost impossible to survive in today's world while following such IDEAL thoughts. I think that if I were at that place, I would have atleast spoken that it was the other one's fault not due to my patriarchal ideology but due to my tendency to avoid any wrong with me

Acharya Ramchandra Shukla one said that anger is necessary in case when something wrong is happening with you or someone else"
Love this. I wish more people shared the same mindset.
"A delusional video, feminism not going to make society better."
This vedio is the best vedio ever
"Dhruv you are talking about definition more than the reality. Feminism is great but now it is not at all about equal rights. Most of them are Men haters who thinks drinking alcohol, abusing and roaming without clothes empowers woman.

Tell me a single right that a male has but a female doesn't. There isn't any! So what are they fighting for? We already have equal rights and opportunities. The only thing needed is strict law to protect men and women from discrimination."
Hi @dhruv can you also make video on fake dowry cases and fake domestic violence cases. How female misuse the law to gain unfair benefits
Pray we have more Dhruv Rathi in societies we live ❤
Excellent
The feminist movement taught women to see themselves as victims of an oppressive patriarchy....Self-imposed victimhood is not a recipe for happiness.
Biologically we aren’t equal then why this all debate for
Jaldi se apne ko feminist bol deta hu cool lagunga

Kya main jaan sakta hu konse rights hai jo ladkiyo nahi milte
I mean who cares women get more priority over men nowadays and on next generation i think everything will be balanced out
For abolishing psuedo feminism we already have Andrew Tate😈😎✅Who is already up for fight for Mens rights
I am feminist
I liked this video but i think dhruv has some personal grudge against animal😂 movie he's constantly poking samdeep and animal in this video
Bro You are Wrong In This Video I Will Explore This
I'm also feminism

Feminist sahi hai matlab equal rights hona sahi hai par equal rights do na kyu hamare laws bhi ladkiyo ke favour mein hai ladko ke liye koi laws nhi bante abhi itne new laws bane hai woh bhi ladki ke favour mein hai ladko ke liye kya ladkiya jo laws ka galat use kar rahi fake cases lagake uska kya

"One thing I also noticed from those anti-feminist stupid alpha male that they justify dowry and equalvate it to alimony.. Coz acc to their logic they're are putting effort in relationship just by bring money.. Meanwhile clearly discrediting the work of a housewife. On top of that when divorce rate is 1% meanwhile dowry almost 99%..


And then they say women are gold diggers and materialistic when in reality they're the one.."

Didn't mention Dr BR Ambedkar. One of the greatest feminist of all time.
"I really had high hopes from your video even you started by saying you are going to talk about issues men are suffering with, but I was disappointed. 
The problem is you have started to be influenced by the section of people who tend to troll you on social media and make video just to respond to them. But there is large section of society that does critical thinking and has real issues that you fail to address.
And a big point to be noted is that when wrong things are doing in the context to a potential right movement, the entire movement gets defamed and so is the case with Women empowerment and Feminism. 
The thought process associated to this movement is ruining huge number of lives because of its misuse. I dare you make videos about real issues is men in the society because of one sided laws and their misuse."

I came across a debate once, between the differences of men and women and one side proclaimed, ""Aurton ke haath se khana achcha banta hai, usme nature ka role hai. Vo aadmiyon se jyada achcha khana bana leti hai. Isme ham kya kar sakte hain.""

Well my only reply is.... Just look at the ratio of men and women as Professional Chefs and you will get your answer."

"Problem is not in feminism. 
But today, girls who potray themselves as feminist actually supports matriarchy. 
Campaigns like 'kill all men' , 'we dont need men' , 'all mens are pig', mens falsely getting abused, bitch files fake rape case against a men to satisfy her ego and destroy a mens career and his reputation in the society is acceptable by the law. 
I do support him in his previous but this time, i think if you want equal rights, then equalism is a better word. 

I read a line in class 10th history chapter 1 (may be) which concludes that 'nationalism leads to imperialism'. 
Can't the same thing be applied to feminism? 
I think i dont support feminism because 'feminism leads to matriarchy'. 
Equalism is a better word.
I am an equalist not a feminist."
"A thing happened with me. A woman around 55 years was travelling with me in auto rickshaw. After some time she started putting allegation on me that I was misbehaving with her. And started to threaten me and asking money for compensation. A police officer intervened and instead of money settlement I just had to say sorry to her. But still it was not my fault.

Edit : If this is not harassment then what's this."
Ap boht acha kam krte ho... Apke liye respect 💐... 💐
When feminists preach about equality then they should also take equal responsibilities like a man. Feminism talk about their rights when only it comes to corporate world but when it comes to hard labour feminism disappears. Men and Women are different by nature they should rather complement each other not compete with each other. Modern day feminism is nothing but toxic wokeism.
"What about Corporate ?
Why Inequality still exists there 

Women can come to office in Sleeveless, Short Skirts  ,Frocks , Jumpsuits and Heels..
But Men have to come in Shirt & Pant only ? 
Why we aren't men's allowed to wear Slippers ,Boxers or Barmoda ??? 
I don't see any Group of Male demanding equality 🤔 in this Dresscode BS

And that's why Men > Women"
"“HIGHLY EDUCATED” DHRUV RATHI DOESN’T UNDERSTAND SOME SIMPLE FACTS SO LETS ENLIGHTEN HIM:

1). MEN AND WOMEN ARE DESIGNED BY GOD FOR DIFFERENT ROLES IN THE SOCIETY. 

2). MEN HAVE 20 TIMES MORE TESTOSTERONE THAN WOMEN WHICH INDICATE MEN ARE PROTECTORS AND PROVIDERS. TO PROVIDE AND PROTECT MEN NEED TO GO OUT IN THE WORLD TO BRING BACK RESOURCES FOR THE FAMILY.

3). WOMEN ARE MORE EMOTIONAL, MEN ARE MORE RATIONAL AND LOGICAL (THESE ARE HARD BIOLOGICAL FACTS) WHICH INDICATE WOMEN BELONG AT HOME FOR NURTURING AND TAKING CARE OF HOME AND FAMILY. AND MEN BELONG OUTSIDE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS/DO BUSINESS/ADD VALUE IN THE SOCIETY.

4). AS THE SOCIETY IS “PROGRESSING” IN THE NAME OF MODERNISM AND FEMINISM, DIVORCE RATES, SUICIDE RATES FOR MEN AFTER MARRIAGE, HOOK UP CULTURE, IS RISING AT AN EXPONENTIAL RATE INDICATING FALL OF SOCIETY. 

5). WHEN A MAN MAKES MONEY, HE THINK OF PROVIDING BETTER FOR HIS FAMILY, WHEN A WOMAN MAKES MONEY, SHE THINKS SHE DOESN’T NEED A MAN. 

6). WHEN WOMEN ARE GIVEN SEXUAL LIBERTY BEFORE MARRIAGE, THEY SLEEP WITH MULTIPLE MEN BEFORE MARRIAGE AND LOSE THEIR ABILITY TO PAIR BOND WITH THEIR HUSBAND, MAKING THE MARRIAGE MORE DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN. IT’S NOT SAME FOR MEN. MEN DON’T GET EASY ACCESS TO SEX. THEY HAVE TO WORK HARD TO BECOME VALUABLE TO ATTAIN SEX FROM WOMEN. THEREFORE SEX COMES HARD TO MEN AND WHAT COMES HARD IS RESPECTED. ON CONTRARY, SEX COMES EASY TO WOMEN AS WOMEN HAVE VALUE JUST BY EXISTING. WHAT COMES EASY ISN’T RESPECTED. 
WOMEN JUST HAVE TO PRESERVE THEIR VALUE BY BEING CHAST UNTIL MARRIAGE. 

7). MEN AND WOMEN ARE NOT EQUAL. MEN LOVE SELFLESSLY . WOMEN LOVE ON CONDITIONS. 

8). WOMEN ARE HYPERGAMOUS CREATURES- THEY LOOK FOR A MAN MORE TALLER, STRONGER, SMARTER, AMBITIOUS, AFFLUENT, DECISIVE THAN THEM.  MEN ON THE OTHER HAND CAN EASILY DATE DOWN. A RICH AND FAMOUS MAN CAN MARRY A POOR WOMAN WORKING AT MCDONALDs. A RICH AND FAMOUS WOMAN WILL NEVER MARRY A BROKE MAN. RONALDO MARRIED A POOR WAITRESS FROM A RESTAURANT AND MADE HER A QUEEN. 

9). PICK UP ANY RELIGIOUS TEXT BOOK AND YOU’LL FIND EXCERPTS REFERRING TO WOMEN BELONGING TO HOME AND MEN BELONGING TO THE OUTER WORLD. THIS IS NOT PATRIARCHY. THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE WAY OF LIFE, AND RELATIONSHIPS AND MARRIAGES WERE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL BACK IN TIMES WHEN WOMEN ACCEPTED THAT THE MAN IS THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY AND WILL LEAD THE FAMILY.

10). FEMINISM IS THE REAL CANCER. ITS DECAYING AND DESTROYING THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY. ITS DESTROYING MARRIAGE AS A CONCEPT. TOMORROW WOMEN WILL START PROTESTING AGAINST GOING TO THEIR HUSBAND’S HOME AFTER MARRIAGE. CURRENT DIVORCE RATE IN THE USA IS 50%. JUST IMAGINE OUT OF EVERY 100 MARRIAGES, 50 ARE ENDING UP IN DIVORCE. AND 80% OF THESE DIVORCES ARE BEING INITIATED BY WOMEN. INDIA IS CATCHING UP TO THAT TREND VERY FAST. 

THIS IS WHAT THESE “EQUAL RIGHTS FEMINISTS” ARE DOING TO OUR GENERATION. INTERNET, SOCIAL MEDIA AND MODERN PARENTING ARE RUINING WOMEN OF TODAY."

Women and men are equal but different both have different duties and responsibilities and should adhere to the ones which they are really capable of.
Use other word for feminism why because many girl in our or western society they do any thing and then tell that they are feminist . If you can't support them then you are bad thay why parseption about this word change there for use other word.
"This Is The Only Video In Your Channel that I doesn't Support 💔💔.... See the Society, How Girls are Dominating and Doing Fake Cases against Male... One Day you will also face ...❤❤By the way BIG Fan... If You are Faminist..tell me . Do you support Reservation for Women ???"

यार फेमिनिसम बहोत अच्छी सोच है समाज के लिए।।।equal rights बिलकुल होना चाहिए।।।but आज भी समाज में बहोत से ऐसे लड़किया है जो rights ka बहोत गलत फायदा उठाती है।।।। देखो equal rights समाज को बेहतर बनाने के लिए पूरी तरह से जरूरी है लेकिन जब 1 धारा इसका गलत फायदा उठाने लगता है तब ये बड़ा toxic हो जाता है।।।।आज भी इस equal rights का गलत फायदा लड़किया बड़े धरले से उठाती है।।।ध्रुव भाई मानो इस बात को।।।।आज भी सिर्फ मेरे नजर में ऐसी 10 से ज्यादा लड़किया है जो सिर्फ पैसों के लिए किसी लड़के की लाइफ खराब कर देती है devoce दे देती है सिर्फ इस लिए उस लड़के के संपति से आधी संपत्ति devoce के बाद मिल जाएगी और बेचारा लड़का कुछ ना कर पाता है।।।क्या हुआ लोग पूछते है क्या कहे equal rights का गलत फायदा उठा ली।।।

Hamari society unaa bagwan ka rupake manthi haa, joo Jevan deti haa,joo kushiya deti haa 

Sir everything has negative and positive please look on that and convience your opinion
If you agree like--------->"
Your video is absolutely correct but then again you have targeted our religion.. You showed a reference from garud puran.. But what about women's right in islam.. Where they are strictly told to cover their whole body and have 0 freedom?
this is a serious issue nowadays. Indian culture is ruined day by day.  we just adopt Western culture day by day. no one can differentiate what is right and what is wrong.
I love you druv true content most people (alpha male ) cant digest the fact that how can this kind of video he will make .... I am a feminist to all my sisters here never give up on your fundamental rights

"Parivaar ko sambhaalna, bachon ko sanskar Dena, Ghar me Puja karna, dharm karm, upavas karna, Ghar walon ko khaana Dena, unki seva, saas,sasur aur pati ki seva karna, ye sab backward hai kyaa ???
Ye sab conservative, regressive baatein hai kyaa ?
According to you, one woman must earn money inorder to command respect ? Inorder to call her a feminist??? 
This is just nonsense, that's all.
I don't like these LGBTQ RIGHTS, MEN'S RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, JUST KNOW UR DHARMA AND FOLLOW THAT, YOUR LIFE IS SUCCESSFUL THAT'S ALL."

If a man is to give female rights to female as if they are in charge or is it because they are already superior and females truly needs acceptance and to be allowed by man? Who is man to give anything to right?

"Mostly feminism is opposed by women herself. Most of the women are tailing some toxic masochistic male for their attention disregarding their self respect. Everyone has a choice, everyone has their freedom. You don't need to spread lectures for feminism or patriarchy it is just drama. Actually reality is education is important. Even after being fully educated someone choose patriarchy then who are you to oppose or criticize their choice."

"In this video Mr Rathee shows Masculinism and infers Feminism is best; In my opinion, Feminism and Masculinism are like Ultra Left and Ultra Right Ideologies; We need a centrist ideology. I don't know if there is a word for that."

I hope at least now people know the real meaning about feminism...it was never about women being dominant it was always about EQUALITY. We are not trying to pull men down we are just trying to create a more humane world for everybody."

23:55 I guess wo jab social media pe bolte hai ki yeh hai feminisim.... They meant to say feminists log jo hote hai unhone iske against bolna chahiye tha may be I am wrong
Good
24:00 from here i agree that many people pointed out as feminism but instead if we look at it broadly the girl wasnt arrested or didnt got any serious charges and if the genders would be opposite the male would be under huge aligations so i think many females and govt. too have taken feminism as matriarchy and thus these days female dominance is growing in many different ways

Word is wrong not the idea

"Equal pay , equal responsibility ! 🙌"
Finally!! Someone talk about the real meaning of feminism .
Disagree 👎
where can i the watch the world before her documentary?
"This time I'm not agreeing with you 
A feminist girl only wants the pros and perks of being as equal as man.
Lekin uske sath kafi kuch bhayaanak bhi ata h jise eo aurat nhi jhel skti most dangerous professions in world are handled by a man 
Same goes with the man being as equal as women we as men can't handle what a woman goes through in her life 
And also the fact is the men who are against feminism just want to protect their mother and sisters from what they won't be able to bear."
He moulded my thoughts for 25 min 5 seconds straight
You are a great guy 👦  I love your video  you are my inspiration
"The day a girl gets married feminism ia crushed. She is supposed to change her name, relocate, leave her aging parents alone. Till there is equality in these aspects all these terms mean nothing"
100% true
"She built temples at Srinagar, Haridwar, Kedarnath, Badrinath, Rishikesh, Prayaga, Varanasi, Naimisharanya, Puri, Rameshwaram, Somnath, Nasik, Omkareshvar, Mahabaleshwar, Pune, Indore, Srisailam, Udipi, Gokarna, Khatmandu etc.

Excepting territories controlled by Afghans, Nawabs & British, she built temples everywhere.
Without her, ALL Tirthas would have been in ruins and there wouldn’t be any standing temple."

Pleased to understand FEMINISM 
"The problem is deeper actually, there are many qualities that are characterized as feminine and masculine.. compassion is believed to be a feminine quality... like why? .. A man can not be compassionate? Aggression is described as a masculine quality... like why? That is why i love the concept of 10 Mahavidyas and 10 Bhairavas... all the qualities possessed by a human are expressed both in masculine and feminine forms.. of course, the stories still have patriarchal elements in them, but it's a good start from where you can start destroying patriarchy within you..."
"His sentence, ""To acquire equal rights, being similar is enough""  explains the bridge between men and women."
What are your thoughts on the girls calling themselves feminist hating men and speaking that they don't need men and also the rights of men are taken ???

""" THE WILLINGNESS OF WOMEN ""

The presence of a greater number of women in a society is not the only prerequisite for polygamy. It is, in addition, compulsory that the woman who is the object of the man’s choice should be willing to enter into the married state. This willingness on the woman’s part is a must before a marriage can be lawful in Islam. It is unlawful to marry a woman by force. There is no example in the history of Islam where a man has been allowed to force a woman into marriage. The Prophet Muhammad’s own view that “an unmarried girl should not be married until her permission has been taken”6 had been recorded by both Bukhari and Muslim. ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas, one of the Prophet’s Companions and a commentator on the Qur’an, narrates the story of a girl who came to the Prophet complaining that her father had her married off against her wishes. The Prophet gave her the choice of either remaining within the bonds of wedlock or of freeing herself from them.7 Another such incident narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas concerns a woman called Burairah and her husband, Mughith, who was a black slave. ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas tells the story as if it were all happening before his very eyes: “Mughith is following Burairah through the paths of Medina. He is crying and his tears are running down his beard. Seeing him, the Prophet said to me, ‘O ‘Abbas, are you not surprised at Mughith’s love for Burairah and Burairah’s hate for Mughith?’ Then the Prophet said to Burairah, ‘I wish you would take him back.’ Burairah said to the Prophet, ‘Is that a command?’ The Prophet replied, ‘No, it is only a recommendation.’ Then Burairah said, ‘I don’t need your recommendation.’”8 There was an interesting case of polygamy which took place during the Caliphate of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab. A certain widow, Umm Aban bint ‘Utbah had four suitors for marriage. All four — ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, ‘Ali ibn abi Talib, Zubayr and Talhah — were already married. Umm Aban accepted the proposal of marriage made by Talhah and, of course, refused the other three, whereupon she was married to Talhah.9 This happened in Medina, the capital of the Islamic State. Among the rejected suitors was the reigning Caliph. But no one expressed even surprise or dismay, the reason being that in Islam, a woman is completely free to make her own decisions. This is a right that no one can take away from her-— not even the ruler of the day. These incidents show that the Islamic commandments giving permission to marry up to four women does not mean having the right to seize four women and shut them up inside one’s home. Marriage is a matter of mutual consent. Only that woman can be made a second or a third wife who is willing to be so. And when this matter rests wholly on the willingness of the woman, there is no cause for objection. The present age gives great importance to freedom of choice. This value is fully supported by Islamic law. On the other hand, the upholders of “feminism” want to turn freedom of choice into restriction of choice."
"i always support your opinion but you began with people questioning over ""toxic feminisim"", yep i support equal rights for women but at today's date feminism is replaced with the tern ""toxic feminism"", you just kept talking about patriarchal society and nothing about toxic Feminism."
"Not hate to other 
But sir you had to include prophet Muhammad in video 
Bcz he is the first feminist"
Nice video 👍🏻❤️
"Fake feminism ❌ 
Feminism ✅"
"I also fight for equal right. 
But my wife dint give me. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
I proud for you bro❤
"THESE DAYS BOYS ARE USING ALPHA AND SIGMA . DR IS SAYING RIGHT. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS,THEY AREN'T BEING GIRL,MEANS WESTERN INFLUENCE IS FU*CKING INDIAN SOCIETY. FEMENISM SHOULD BE PROMOTED BUT WESTERN INFLUENCE HAS MADE GIRLS OF THESE DAYS OF UPPER CLASS (their behaviour) TO HANDLE AND PORTRAY A MASCULINE CHARACTER BOYS DO ALPHA ."
"I think women in India are much ahead in terms of equal rights than western countries, here's why - 
1. Many Hindu Gods are women
2. Our 2 main mythology stories are around the dignity of women.
3. Shivaji maharaj where created any built by there mother - Jijau mata. (In 1600)
4. We had tararani Bai (from Kolhapur) who fought against Mughals. ( 1700s)
5. We have Jhasi ki rani, who fought in war (1800)
6. We have Savitribai phule, for made school for girls ( 1800)
7. India had women prime minister - Indira Gandhi for 8-9 years, and 2 women presidents - Pratibha Patil and drapati Marmo.

All above shows that India has always valued women, from very past till present.

Whereas compared to Western countries, there is no History of women fighting in war. US did not had a single women President so far. 

Overall, India should have support for women in terms of equal rights, but western countries need more feminism than Indians."
👏 ye hui na baat
"Almost in all physically intensive jobs men are looked upon. Why no females fighting against ememies in army, air force and navy in life threatening situations? I would say the govt should start include atleast 50% women in all govt positions, including government and parliament. Then include them in critical army operations. This will truly impart equality."
What rights do men have that women don't 🤔
"Hi Dhruv, I have seen many women related videos. Still I am confused. I want your opinion.
1. Boy=asset, women=liability. The problem here is women must have to take rest during the baby process like pregnancy, birth, feeding. After that she might leave her job. Solution?
2. Why husbands are not ready to move into their wife's house, why men can't handle house work and wife handles office work only. Also if both are going to work then at the end i think they are giving less time to their children. Can one of them be with children alternately?"
Very information video rathi ji❤❤🎉🎉

"Just one wrong information I want to point out. Barasat Kalikrishna Girls' High School is the first girls school established in India in 1847, while Savitribai Phule founded her school in 1848."
Very well described about feminism👏👏👏Otherwise in Bollywood movies they promote nudity which is the main key of feminism which gives bad influence on all the young generations.
"Ye video aapko 50 saal pahnne banana chahiye , aaj ke time ladkiyaan hamare barabar hi hai aur kuchh ladkiyaan itni aage hai ki reels pe sb dikhaa deti hai aur ghar vaale rokte bhi nhi hai"
Currently Everything is equal for both the gender so what Wright's are feminist asking for ?

Support to feminism ❤
"Bro plz make a video on indian's today's rural area castesim.
I mean i hate people still believe god gave them certain works to perform 😡"
"We men are not against feminism . we are against the women who do not use the rights properly or misuse them . 
Making fictitious accusations of physical or psychological abuse, trying to make money, or getting a leg up in divorce and custody disputes are many of the reason some men dislike feminism.
While it is important to help and defend sexual assault victims, there have also been cases of false rape accusations.
I hope one day everyone will understand this and your video is a good example of it ."
Thanks Sir for your time
Sir ur video is fine . But u shouldn't discriminate b/w a black and a white man .
"Regardless of all the comments praising him for being equal and what not.
Feminism is a real mind consciousness cancer spreading in society and labelling anyone speaking up against it as ""chapri"" just goes to show how little counter arguments they have thus resorting to such name calling
If this side is chapriya then it's not incorrect to call the other side randiya"
"Problem is not in feminism. 
But today, girls who potray themselves as feminist actually supports matriarchy. 
Campaigns like 'kill all men' , 'we dont need men' , 'all mens are pig', mens falsely getting abused, bitch files fake rape case against a men to satisfy her ego and destroy a mens career and his reputation in the society is acceptable by the law. 
I do support dhruv but this time, i proudly say i am 'equalist' and not a 'feminist'. 

I read a line in class 10th history chapter 1 (may be) which concluds that 'nationalism leads to imperialism'. 
Can't the same thing be applied to feminism? 
I think i dont support feminism because 'feminism leads to matriarchy'. 
Equalism is a better word."
Ye tha shi topic
The only person who can tell everything properly.........
Evolution of Feminism is very noble and need for stable and strong family society but today modern toxic feminism wave will   total disaster for family and social society..... Cases of injustice toward men is increasing

"Feminism that focuses on eradication of gender inequality is fine and it should be promoted but the problem is that in regional level especially in Western countries ( not everywhere) this is taken as something else where they seem to attack on male sentiments saying to uphold feminism(even if they have got every possible rights)......the reality is in developed countries there is rarely a difference in the status of male and female like it happened to be in the past....... secondly many males are triggered with the name itself ""FEMISISM"" how can it be in favour of both genders I think that's a place where activists should consider😅 it would hear good if it's named HUMANIST rather......with evolving world the conservative mindset of lot of people have changed and I think blaming and criticising someone on the basis of gender is no longer a part of the modern world (if I have said something wrong I seek apology)❤"

That question mark is the main element of his title...
"कृपया पुण्यश्लोक अहिल्यादेवी होलकर पर वीडियो बनाएं, वह विश्व इतिहास में नारीवाद का वास्तविक उदाहरण थीं। उन्होंने काशी विश्वनाथ से लेकर सोमनाथ, केदारनाथ और रामेश्वरम तक 1000 से अधिक मंदिरों का निर्माण कराया है।उन्होंने मस्जिद भी बनवाई है, उन्होंने 30 साल तक शासन किया है, उन्होंने संघर्ष किया था, आप कल्पना कर सकते हैं"
In chhapri gangs ko feminism ko in incidents se jodne ka bahana isliye milta hai kyunke is type ka toxic feminism ab common hota ja raha hai. Aur real feminism jo tha vo kahi dab gaya hai mitti mein.

""" BE A GOOD WIFE ""

Frank Borman, an American astronaut went into space with a woman astronaut in the same spacecraft. After his return from the voyage he said: “Having women on the spacecraft was okay except that it would be upsetting to put a male and a female too close together for a long time.” Borman’s comment certainly upset the feminists. One American lady remarked in the course of a fiery speech: “Mr. Frank Borman would never have existed had his parents not come together.” Scientific research together with the realities of practical life has shocked the cherished concepts of feminists leading some of them to rethink their ideals. An American lady, Mrs. Marabel Morgan, a mother of two, recently published a book entitled Total Woman. Here is the simple magic formula she divulged to her American sisters so that they may lead successful married lives. “Be nice to your husband, stop nagging him and understand his needs.” In less than a year this book sold three million copies. To the writer the perfection of womanhood lies in her ability to become a good companion of her husband rather than seek an independent life.31 The truth is that the total woman is one who can be a total companion to her husband."

"feminist men bhi 2 type k hain bhai:
* jo sahi me females ki growth or empowerment chaahte hain apni bahu, beti, biwi, maa k waaste, ye specially lower or middle-class men hain...
* jo male female divide karke masculinity of general men ko challenge karna chaahte hain taaki political, sexual or economic gains liye ja saken...ye specially elite men or toxic men hain..."

I think nina gupta's video was taken out of context. She was speaking from the context of physical differences not in terms of capability of womens.

Wha!
This comments might not get noticed in 5k comments..but... Is there any other books that you came across while researching on this topic. That discusses about  effects of patriarchy on men. I would like to read upon those.
kisan andolan par video bnao sir plz
Please note. My intention is not to make an uncomfortable issues. The video you are making in Hindi language but  all the reference of  english wording spoken language .If people don't understood to understand the meaning of each english wording choosen words then what is the solution   to believe.
"I feel this video was not properly explained Dhruv. I understand Feminism and equal opportunity but I don't quite agree with Patriarchy. Because Patriarchy has  changed a lot in centuries and in 21st Century there girls getting more opportunity, income and equal recognition. If People want to smash the Patriarch, why are Men still held accountable for Alimony post divorce even when wife's got a great Job. Or custodial bias in  child custody case. You see Men and women have different roles in the society and most women in relationship  prefer to be with men who are wealthy and look after their needs. A women who's poor may end up getting married to Financially secure Man. But you'll never see in society a women marrying a broke guy. Because sadly that's how society works. Men spend more money on women than women spending on a Man. Women benefit From modern day Patriarchy. ""Modern-day patriarchy perpetuates inequality against men and rewards women"""

Ok dokey Mr. feminist state a single right in your next video which is not applicable for women here I'll wait.
Per dhruv bhai main to single huun 😢
I watched whole video thoroughly and I agree with all points but Dhruv Rathee smartly portray Hindu patriarchy but not Muslim patriarchy.  Why he not open his mouth on Hisab not on Muslim women right . Always defame only Hindu patriarchy.

"you need to speak to Neil DeGrasse about men and violence, it is not so easy to make such arguments based only on society structure and norms but it is how Men, hormones and the same organs function differently. Men suffer more in some cases in diseases and women more in others. Both bodies are trully different. Good video but could have been better with more info and some statements like not agreeing with Nina gupta is unfortunate but it is scientifically impossible to agree with your opinion.
Alpha males are all on social media which is the real toxic cause of issues with society  and not movies. 

Nice face saving done by including toxic feminist and trying to justify you created a video on criticising Animal and not them, but even Salman Khan and Ranbir have said the same things these are films and they absolutely hate the characters and do not promote these characters. 

Make a podcast with Neil, that would be better for this subject."

"Right,
Thanks❤"
I  always waiting for the video 😊😊
"I never would have imagined you would so dumb and foolish. You quoted Buddah but you have no clue about his teachings or modern day pyschology and neurochemistry. The reality of existence is mind not a physical body, and one's thinking process would define their reality and existence. Testesterone and Astrogen are 2 different neurochemical and transmitters, I hope you would know which chemical influnce which gender. Oh i remember, you are so illiterate that I think I should educate you a little. Testesterone influnce male pyschology and induce traits, qualities and characteristics like aggresive behaviour when threaten, risk taking capabilities, excitement toward challenges, domination when meet peer competition and make the mind to use rational over emotions. Where as astrogen is the chemical that influence women physcology induce traits like emotional thinking process, emotional understanding and bonding, submissive behvaiour especial during intercourse. When the reality and identity of female and male mind is totally different, one is working on rational and one is working on emotions. Then how could you construct the arguments using your bogus hypothetical examples from your mind and forged media to convince millions of people with out any solid evidence that you have understood feminism and now you are here to teach others? Man give me a break! I laugh at your foolishness, and 90% of female are happy being the actual female, they do not want to compete with men. Where as 10% of women with some kind of mental disorder are opting gender equality and men like you which are also very minute percentage among men are defending them. So 10% female population and very little numbers of men with mental disorders like you should marry each other live a happy life, instead of preaching this hypthatical examples and your fithy opinions. And btw Dhruv, I see all of your videos and you are making shit out of evey good subject and topic due to lack of knowledge. 
Btw do you own chatgpt course yourself. Get help from chatgpt and educate yourself in understanding the actual difference between men and women, its not just 3 organs, its  a whole different identity, reality and thinking process."

"Dhruv Sir, I just have one question, regarding equal work and equal pay, considering how immoral and inhumane many companies can be for their profits, it is quite possible that they would not hire any female worker if the following law is applied, as the companies who can make millions of die for profits, can obviously reject a women as they would pay women whenever on paternity leave without working, whereas men do not require the compulsory leave. This would be within the law too, so do you think there should be reservation in corporate sector too for women and how would it be managed in such a big country and does any have enough skilled women for the skilled resources or this plan would be a whole big mess?"

"I donot agree with you. I will heed the wisdom of personalities like Professor Jordan Peterson and Author Robert Greene, acknowledging that differences between genders are inherent in nature, just as differences exist within social hierarchies. Embracing these gender differences is essential, recognizing that each gender has unique strengths and roles. Just as no man can replace a mother’s nurturing role during a child’s critical period of life, similarly, no woman can replace men’s roles requiring physical endurance in extreme occupations like the military, mining, construction, firefighting, and others. True happiness comes from supporting each other rather than competing against gender counterparts to uphold certain ideologies at the expense of happiness."

I don't think you have the right to call someone 'stupid' or 'irrational' because of the way they think. Everyone has lived through different situations and they ought to think their way. It's not like you can call someone 'stupid' if you don't like someone's way of thinking. I am not saying womens are inferior to men so don't twist my words.

"WHITHER WOMEN'S LIBS ?

From the 12th to the 16th of January, 1987, a conference was held in Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi, in which philosophers, scientists, writers and artists from 15 countries participated. This five-day conference was arranged by the Government of India on the topic, “Towards New Beginnings.” Many distinguished ladies of the western world, who have now grown old, were among those who participated. They had spent all their lives working for Women’s Lib, but their mood was one of frustration. The Indian Express cites Germaine Greer of Australia as a case in point: They are feminists of different hues — Ms. Germaine Greer, the outspoken, aggressive writer from Australia, and Ms. Gisele Halimi, a Tunisian-born lawyer who spearheaded the women’s movement in France along with Simone de Beauvoir and others. But both voice a concern that is troubling feminists in the West today — Whither women’s lib? Ms. Greer seems more mellow today: the fire that raged in The Female Eunuch is strangely missing. “The movement has solved some problems and left us with a different set of problems,” exclaimed Ms. Greer. “Perhaps the problem was that we didn’t take our mothers with us. We left them behind, found them antiquated. And now that many of us are mothers ourselves with teenaged daughters, perhaps we understand our mothers better.”2 “The West has no answers to the problems of inequality between sexes,” says the internationally acclaimed writer Germaine Greer. The erroneous belief of western women that the females in veils are unequal and the ones with make-up minus the head-cover are free and liberated has to be rejected. Referring to the prevalence of “wife-beating” even in the so-called civilized West, she asks, how about the unequal treatment meted out to females in the U.S. and England in the areas of wages and jobs? Well, one-fourth of the crimes in England emanate from violence against women. The man-woman relationship understood in the West as an extension of role-models is the primary cause of strain in the sexual relationships. All the western women identify themselves with the bahu — the bride — forgetting that the mother-in-law and the sister-in-law are also the specific role models to be played by females. She feels that child bearing for a woman is a unique investment: “The joys of motherhood fill the blanks that cannot be satiated in the specific husband-wife role models.” Known for her non-conformist and non-traditional views, Ms. Greer advocates “coitus interruptus” in the area of birth-control: “The array of occlusive devices, spermicidal creams, quinine pessaries, douches, syringes, abortifacient pills and rubber goods of all shapes and sizes are the ill-effects of a growing consumer-culture. These have achieved nothing but added strain in the sexual relationships.”3 Ms. Halimi, is more frank. “It is a bad time for the women’s movement” she admitted. “It is down at the moment and we are trying to find the reasons for it. Perhaps we got everything women wanted too fast — contraception, abortion, and divorce. And the problems that face women today are not strong enough to give the movement new force and strength.” Women have very specific values and morals. “They have a different view of humanity. I am not saying that it is better than that of men, but it is different. And women have to prove that they are women, and not men,” she emphasized.4 According to religious teaching, the woman’s “role model” was that of mother and housekeeper. She was meant to bear and rear children, and manages the home. The modern role model is that of the busy woman executive, functioning on an equal footing with men in every sphere of the professional world. Years of experiment have shown that the latter role is unrealistic. In their old age, the same western women, who had fervently advocated the new role model, are the very ones who are now asking for a return to the status quo ante. Does this leave any room for doubt about the superiority of the role model postulated by religion?"

But I've some questions
Why when speak about Feminism then always speak wright banners woman power women rights why not saying equal power equal rights... When maximum time we use on speach of feminism about women women women it's look like men vs women... I know in our society women are sufferers we should to talk about them and take action but please not only for the women please speak for both everytime, admire both's problem 
And some fact that address it male vs female 
Like on court always give priority to the women as I know
I've only a request; when anyone speak about feminism please use words for both without take any gender name because there are not only 2 gender in our society."

aaj pata chala ki dhruv hijda hai😂
This is an ideal explanation of feminism but the fact is that first the feminist should be taught what feminism stands for as what we have been seeing mostly are uneducated people spreading non sense. Patriarchy is a bad thing for both men and women the sooner we realise that the better. It is not about hating the other gender which is completely useless. The society needs both men and women to function and both genders have their traditional roles and thats a fact.
Thank you so much sir

"About men, dhruv sir explained a lot about it so exact as possible feels like I'm talking to myself alone looking at the mirror😅just hats-off to you 🙌."
"Feminism is nowadays has turned into matriarchy . Feminists now want special rights not equal rights. 

If you want equal rights , you have to take equal responsibilities too. Druv you have explained true feminism which I agree with . But the reality now is feminism is breaking down the family system . I would say if a woman go outside to earn money when males of the family are capable of earning, how would the child grow up with proper morality and teachings. What is the benefit of being educated when you don’t  educate your own child rather leave them to the illiterate women to teach them ? Men and women have the different roles for a heathy society . The should take thier own responsibility. But obviously discrimination between men and women should not allowed to be established in the society . That's what I think . If you don’t like it you can ignore it. 

One more thing -
There were no feminist in world war 2  ."

"Indian law men and women, explain your thoughts. Then you realised, what is the problem of feminist."
"I agree with most of the points but there are certain points which may need attention.

1. POSH in corporates... totally against men.
2. In divorces cases - Alumni and child support definitely law is in favour of women. 
3. Eve teasing - only men become victim.
4. Women need equal pay in work place but at the same time ask for every privilege possible for women - yup, I am talking about maternity leave. If a women gets pregnant, and needs time off, so does a husband to take care of his wife during this period.
5. Women wants to roam freely at night - definitely yes. But, should take a man along for protection. This world is not safe for anyone, but in many of the cases women have higher chances of being victim than  a man. 
5. If equal opportunities are given to women, then it should be applicable in every field of work. Even in fields like Oil Rigs, fire fighter services, construction etc. Not just the AC cabinet jobs.

Over all the video was informative and good but should have addressed these points too."

Reality of Druv Rathee?
""" TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES ""

Plain Truth, a well-known American magazine with a world-wide circulation of 7,850,000, published an article entitled ‘Teen Pregnancy’ along with a photograph of Sally, an American teenager. The article included a letter written by Sally, which, though short, is painful and shocking:  When I was 8 years old I first had sex with a boy of 15. I did it because I lack love and attention from my parents. I need love, and my parents never show me any. Nothing really changed at home, and at 15 I became pregnant. My boy friend blamed me and left. I had nowhere to turn, I was trapped, so I had an abortion. Now I’m afraid to date anyone, and I cry myself to sleep every night.5 “For every 1000 girls between 15 and 19 in America,” wrote New York correspondent George Gorden, “96 of them are pregnant.”6 Such are the tragic consequences of deviation from nature. This is the result of deliberately ignoring the fact that when God created men and women, He laid down rules for their relationship with each other: on reaching a sufficiently mature stage of development, they were to marry, have children and, by a process of mutual co-operation, make a home in which to bring up those children, thus providing a stable base for the progress of mankind. But western modernity became so preoccupied with the concept of freedom that it dispensed with the kind of bonds which held men and women together in a healthy family relationship. The resulting disregard for the institution of marriage gave birth to various kinds of evils in western society, as may be judged from the above-mentioned examples. The free mixing of men and women, with the sexual liberation it implies, is wholly against nature. In matters of sex, a woman prefers a single partner. It is in her nature to love only one man faithfully. Men, on the other hand, are promiscuous by nature. In a situation, therefore, where freedom of sexual relationships is damaging to faithful sexual partnerships, it is the women who suffer psychologically. Emotionally, they have to pay a very high price for their emancipation. The famous Australian feminist, Ms. Germaine Greer, has acknowledged, now that she is of a more mature age, that her zeal for the sexual liberation movement in her youth was not realistic. In an interview with the Indian Express she lamented over the present state of affairs: “What is worrying today is the results of the sexual liberation movement -— the number of teenaged girls who have been on the pill since they were 12 and 13, the number of teenaged girls who get pregnant by the time they are 15 and 16. What is happening to them? Sex means something quite different for men. They can love and leave. When the time comes to go to university, they can take off quite easily. Women have a different sensibility. They love with their heads, hearts and loins. And a broken love affair leaves them quite shattered. I have seen it happen to people close to me. And it is terrible.”7 In modern times Muslim society has fallen prey to many evils, but the reasons for this having happened are different in respect of the West and Islamic civilizations. In the case of the latter, it is deviation from Islamic principles which has caused the rot to set in, whereas in the former case, it is adherence to a new set of man-made principles which has had so deleterious an effect."

"if a girl seek for her husband, she chooses a guy who earns more then her, he is taller then her, more educated then her, smarter then her, who can take her to dinner, pay al bills and fights to the danger when it is needed. Will all feminist consider the both person to be as equal?"
Proud Feminist 🙌
"Chhapris are a caste-oppressed community of people who made or mended chhappars, temporary roofs. This was the only job they were allowed to do because of their caste, which was assigned to them by the accident of birth. However, the word has in recent years become a pejorative for someone who tries hard to be flamboyant. Looking blingy and flashy has been a form of expression and assertion by historically oppressed castes when they manage to earn enough money, but upper castes have looked down on such transformations, assigning the caste name to anything that is ""cringe""."

But maine yeh realise kiya hain ki  hum females socially , mentally or tradition ke naam par same gender se hi (females) pareshan rahti hain.

"Feminism is not the solution, even though i am a Pregressive Leftist i am not a feminist, because I don't think making both men and women equal would ever work, because as long as thier is a distinction made by society based on sex, their will be discrimination. Its like doing apartheid and believing both white and black people are equal, if we believed all people are equal, we wouldn't have came up with segregating people based on skin colour.

Because if society believes that sex is important enough that there should be two seperate catagories of people based on it, there will be assumptions and roles being thrusted upon these sets of people.  In reality there is nothing as a men or a women, these are just social constructs(must read on social constructs), also known as make-beliefs, also known as 'bhram' in Indian culture, we are told from the age we are born that we are a boy or a girl, solely based on our sex. we are not born girls or boys, we were told to be boys and girls. Gender is social construct and people are born with different sexes, same as people are born with different colours.

There are many other differences between people, but society makes no distinctions based on them, as you mentioned too. Its doesn't matter if you think sex is important enough to base segregation on. And i think we all as a society have came far enough to believe that there shouldn't be discrimination based on what you are born as at birth, be it colour, bloodline, or sex.

What i think and Many Gender Abolitionists like me think, is the solution is that we abolish gender, we are not segregated based on our sex, we are who we choose to be. We take moral responsibilities based on what role we choose to take, If we abolish gender, we are just people with different sexual organs, no one is a man, no one is a women, we are just people. Because gender as it might seem, is not something fundamental to us, societies construct them and we have abolished many things that society constructed before and at that time, those things felt like they are fundamental to world, but they were not and we progressed.

If we want equality we need to get rid of Gender as a whole."

"I am a girl from grade 8th and I want to join the Indian Army. More specifically Infantry which is currently not for women because of many valid reasons. I do agree! But why not let capable women join? Women who are capable of going through that level of mental and physical strain should be allowed to join the Combat Arm. When I put forward this point in society, people called me a feminist and when I show even a spark of ambition, people around me say""Ghar bhi toh sambhalna padega. Posting door ho gayi toh bacchon ko kaun dekhega?"" (You will have to look after the house as well. If you will get posted far away from home, who will look after the children?) Boys in my class mocked me as a feminist. I didn't get the true essence of what is feminism and I took it as an insult as girls and boys alike said it in a disgusted way. People like Dhruv Rathee and Emma Watson enlighten everyone about this. People need to understand that feminism is not synonymous with women hating men. You have explained it beautifully. Hats off!! Now I can wear the ""feminist"" tag with pride. I hope to serve my motherland with valour while being shoulder to shoulder with my male counterparts. I hope the Indian Govt. and society are enlightened and supportive of this by the time I'll be eligible to join. I know that posting this comment might brew up controversies but I want each and everyone to know that afterall, in the eyes of God everyone is equal and that gender equality works both ways. Let's make this world a better place to live and do our part. JAI HIND!

"Dhruv, I think u will have a more nuanced view on equality of genders once u start a family.. Giving birth to a child & being a good mother r a full time job that is in no way inferior to earning money! U r just mouthing a black n white simplistic ideology of Woke Feminism that does not take into account the needs of an infant in the initial years of its life nor does it consider the mental n emotional transformation a woman goes through during pregnancy..!"

"I am not against feminism but i am against feminist bcoz there are almost 95% of feminist that thinks there are only the mens that dont want women to grow more than them but not all men are like this.Also,some feminist have to think that not all mens are wrong and also some mens have to think that no all womens are wrong,same goes with racism and religions.there are some wrong peoples and some right peoples in every community.Don't hate each other if u dont want to love each other.❤"
Hello sir one video Indian farmers k liye please
"2:04. OK that's the definition of ""feminism"" but it contradicts itself just by using the term ""feminism"". Why use a term that sounds more like about one gender? If feminism is about equality, why not simply call it EQUALISM? What is the point of inventing a term when there exists a term already which BETTER conveys its meaning."
Ek video intercaste marriage per bhi banaye bahut hi complicated mudda hai please

"What a Great video ..This is the video that Literally everyone must watch and change their thoughts if they can. 
and on the topic of men, i dont think all men/people are all that bad, i think you must talk to the person youre close  to and they'll understand maybe because theyll be going through the same thing as you. But some people take a lot of pressure on themselves becuase of this patriarchial mindest, pls talk to your closed ones and theyll sure understand."

""" PRINCIPLE OF DIVISION OF LABOUR ""

Within the social framework, however, Islam — to the extent that it is both natural and practical — has adopted the division of labor in respect of the sexes, the man’s field of activity being basically external to the home, while the woman’s is domestic. This division, however, has never been intended as a form of discriminatory treatment. Its main purpose has always been to preserve the distinctive characteristics of both sexes, while deploying their respective talents and skills in the most socially useful manner. This enables both sexes to make the best use of their innate capabilities without causing any undue disruption in the family or in society. In modem parlance, this is a form of managerial optimization rather than sexual discrimination. For this principle to be effective, the spheres of activity of men and women have had to be quite different and, of course, separate from each other. That is to say that the man’s field of activity is in the outside world, while the woman’s is in the home. This traditional distinction has been so often cited by feminists as an inhibiting factor in women’s lives that the true meaning of equality has been lost sight of. After all, it will be the very same virtues in thought, word and deed which will be prerequisites for both sexes to enter Paradise. If the qualities of piety, humility, honesty, patience and compassion are demanded of men, they will in like measure be demanded of women. The fact that men and women function in different spheres has no bearing whatsoever on the ultimate equality — equality in the eyes of God."
feminism is just nonsense. Man and Woman can never be equal

Literally the best explanation of feminism! Thank you so much for such the great content!!!
Sir dipression aur anxiety pr bhi video banaiye
Don’t understand the hatred for Animal movie from you Dhruv. Why you looking only few scenes without context? Kindly see it again to understand it completely.
"Why you don't make video on  equal right to all religions place 
Why masjid and church are free and temple under govt control"
Bhai par aisi bhi characterless women hoti hai jo jhootha case kar deti hai innocent ladko par. Men ke paas rights hai hi nhi. Agar kisi bhi case mei ladki ka jhooth pakda jaaye toh sazaa nhi hoti usko. Tum toh bahut fuddu bnate ho logon ko feminism aur anti-right wing videos bnake. Tum ek hi side ki or mat jhuko. Right wingers ko bhi samjho.
"The thing you didn't adress is that the feminism on social media most of the time isn't any real feminism, that is called Neo Feminism, which stand against men's rights and opinions"
Awesome man! Best explanation for what is actual feminism..not to hate male and always be in the side of female!👏
SavitriBai Phule pe video banao bhai
Dhruv you are so honest 😊
"Please talk about Islamic patriarchy next time. 
This was good though!"
"I saw so many feminist girls targeting men on every aspect, i do support the rights of women but i hate those women who don't have respect for men. They behave like, they don't need men."
3 Different Thumbnails in last 30 minutes 😂
Awesome Dhruv.... You've explained it so well. Being a woman I keep telling the same things to some of my friends but they act like they know it all and it's the nature of male and female from ancient times. And it's never gonna change . It's frustrating so I don't bother telling them anything at all.  Loved the video ❤❤❤❤❤❤

"you told the defination of american feminism , but that word is being wrongly used, oil rig mein kitni aurtein kaam krti hain ?? mard hi kiun family bill deta hai ? gutters mein ghus k konsi aurtein safai krti hain ? real world mein ao brother,  fake rape case mein mard band hojata hai jail mein but kya aurtein jail jati hain ? jb qanoon same nhi, treat same nhi krte, jb mard aurat ko thapar marde tou hr koi us mard ko gali deta hai but agr aurat mard ko thapar marde tou its ok, apka content mein shouq se deikhta hai but din ba din illogical hotay ja rhe ho,"
Mai nhi kah rhaa yeh galat hai ya sahi bus ek baat hai ki why people feminism ke naam pe special power dete hai ki ladke hamesha galat hai he doesn't took a example where men suffering from fake allegations and many thing but yeh apni raag alaap rahe bus

"You should have covered the point where men themselves become feminist when it comes to the life of their mothers, sisters and daughters, but show their patriarchy skills on wife and other women. 
And hypocrisy is immense. They want their sisters not to adjust to anything and want their sisters to marry a successful person, but they mock other women who choose financially successful person."

Don't have words to say...😔😔😔
"Claps for you 😊👏, so clearly you explained it all, i am really happy to see your efforts for clearing this misunderstood topic, both the alpha males and the females having patriarchal mindset who really doesn't even know the meaning of feminism should watch this video, i hope this at least make them understand the true meaning and its importance of feminism and its history and the dark patriarchal mindset that they irrespective of their gender think that is right"
"I believe the only way we could stop this toxicity and so called 'men vs woman' is by  stop comparing womne and men.They have their own struggles, we can't compare them. Some women are better than somethings and some men are better at somethings. Its time we start living like actual humans because the so called humans these days arent real humans but are monsters.People like Dhruv are real humans and have humanity"

"I have always heard this word around me and even searched for its meaning available online, but the reality of feminism had never knocked on my door, until today. Thanks for developing clarity regarding this topic. It made me conclude that I too want to be a feminist from now onwards because it not only talks about equal opportunities and respect but also gives you moral support from all directions. It is an important issue for both women & men. Thank you!"

Ah shit! Here we go again
"these women rights are indeed good for our society 
But i thik u should have mentioned a very important person who raised his voice for women rights in the society where female childs were buried alive, females were considered as object to bet upon and at that time he,PROPHET MUHAMMED (SAW) raised his voice for  females 
He gave Women  right to own property, to buy and sell, to inherit, to give charity and to give gifts. It is not permissible for anyone to take a woman’s wealth without her consent.

Women were given the right to a decent life, without facing aggression or being wronged. Women have the right to be educated; in fact it is obligatory to teach them what they need to know and many more

Not from religious point of view but just for the given topic"
Patriarchy and feminism will still remain the part of the discussion which will never end.

"I have seen many girls and Women who found equality and right in society they made the society worse  by their light mind and made the men more Vulnerable it is my 100% accurate experience over 50-60 cases, So I am Patriarchal and against the Feminism, I hate women in Power, Women should be only inside home,  Even our Indian Law and Order are blindly in Favour of  Female there are many cases where men spent 5-10 years in jail even life imprisonment on False cases and later they found innocent😢😢😢 
Specifically in this generation. 
Don't judge me I am Post Graduate in Technology and AI Engineering.

"But 90% of feminists are toxic and men haters, keeps conditions on men about their height and salary. So on paper feminism might sound better but it's toxic in real life. So be against feminism but support equality. 
Also men it's okay to cry but never comes okay to keep crying.
Feminism is a way to make men weaker ..thats the reason why these idiots say ""Women Should not cry, be strong and be a fighter but they say men to stay weak"". To all men and women, I only say have compassion towards one another and be strong."

"Thankyou so much sir 
Today I got to know the real meaning of feminism before I was not so sure about what actually it means but today's episode was very enlightening.
Thanks for sharing great information."
"For me feminism is the ensurity of equal rights. For me, both men and women are physically different from each other but they are equal as human. For me, if women do the same work as a man then they deserve the same payment as a man generally gets. A woman can be the president and a man can be one too. A woman can join military if she fulfils her requirement like a man. Feminism doesn't mean women don't need men. Both men and women need each other in life cause humans are social beings. A man can be super affectionate without being questioned and a woman can too. Both deserve the same respect."
I like your video very much
Women can file a fake r@pe case against a man without any proof. Make a video on this topic. There is now a trend in the society for women to file fake cases for money as fake victims.
"I was dying to listen these lines from someone popular on internet,  anyone could have spoken these facts but no one dared to .... the last lines are nothing less than pure truth , feminism was never a comparison between man and woman  and true feminists never supported pseudofeminism,  but the fact is that , every opportunity/law/campaign gets misused in india before it can be used properly , same happened with feminism,  women are still facing issues but now people are so fed up from pseudofeminism that they want to just eradicate the concept of feminism,  the harsh reality is That the reasons of why we need feminism are still much more than the cases of it's misuse , still people on internet are spreading hate between men and women. People keep on saying that women only want Power they do not Want to do hard work and all , but they fail to mention it's origin , women have always Done hard work , but for men household work was not enough , they always Said , kaam hi kya Hai,  ghr pe hi rhna Hai Sara din , the bread winner of the family was always considerd powerful,  and he only took the decisions , he often failed to recognise other's thinking,  emotions and sacrifices that's why women wants to be the bread winner of the family , they want to be independent,  only If men had treated women differently , then this situation would not have happened today , women always craved for love , respect and recognition of her own existence independently,  but men failed to support even the bare minimum due to the patriarchal mindset and fragile ego . As a feminist I clearly know that both woman and man need each other , want each other , we shouldn't let this patriarchy create hatred among us , because evil has no face , either man or woman,  but as in general no one supports the wrong doing  so let's not hate the concept of feminism and females ."

""" WESTERN WOMAN ""

The “New Woman” has been proclaimed with a certain regularity for a century or more, Time magazine reminded its readers in a 1972 special edition devoted to an exploration of the status of women in America.1 In 1989 the Scots traveller James F. Muirhead observed that it was man who was subservient in American life because he was “the hewer of wood, the drawer of water and beast of burden for the superior sex” (i.e. females). The feminists disagreed, insisting it was they who were dominated. In 1920 American women won the right to vote, and in the 1920s and 1930s began to go to college in considerable numbers, with the expectation of entering the professions. Women believed that “the battle had been won.” But, after the vicissitudes of the Great Depression of post-World War II economic boom, the feminist movement was reborn. It was a time of turmoil in American society: President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated in 1963, and the U.S. engagement in the Vietnam War prompted radical protests and widespread questioning of traditional values and institutions, especially among the youth. The “new feminism” movement was a phenomenon of the restlessness found in the American woman of the 1960s and 1970s. “By all rights, the American woman today should be the happiest in history,” Bonnie Angelo observed in Time’s 1972 cover story. “She is healthier that U.S. women have ever been, better educated, more affluent, better dressed, more comfortable, pampered by gadgets. But there is a worm in the apple. She is restless in her familiar familial role; no longer quite content with the homemaker-wife-mother part in which her society has cast her ... Many are in search of a new role that is more independent, less restricted to the traditional triangle of — children, kitchen and church.” According to Angelo, all but the staunchest advocates of “women’s liberation” agree that woman’s place is different than man’s — but the restless American woman of the 1970s was not so sure just what that place was. The “new feminism” increasingly influenced young women to stay single, and transformed marriages by ending once automatic assumptions about woman’s place, stated Angelo. Widespread commercial dissemination of oral contraceptives — the Pill — together with the overturning of state laws prohibiting abortion on demand — a process which began in the mid-1960s, but remains enmired in controversy today -— had the effect of separating sexual relations from the solemn institution of marriage. In 1972, women already made up one third of the U.S. work force, but their pay was much lower than men and they were generally confined to the lower ranking and lower skilled jobs. A soaring divorce rate, however, meant that in 1972 some 20 million Americans lived in households dependent on women as the sole or principal bread winners. A Psychology Today survey at the time found that even among male respondents, 51 percent agreed that “U.S. society exploits women as much as blacks.”2 In the more colorful phraseology of the American politician, diplomat and author, Booth Luce: “Power, money and sex are the three great American values today, and women have almost no access to power except through their husbands. They can get money mostly through sex -— either legitimate sex, in the form of marriage, or non-married sex.”3 Indeed, the changes in sexual morality in Europe and the United Status during the 1960s and 1970s were drastic and pervasive. Unlike their parents, many members of the young generation view premarital sex as good instead of bad. A Gallup poll in 1970 in the United States found that three out of four students were indifferent to virginity, or the lack of it, in the person they marry.4 Said British gynecologist John Slome: ‘‘The kiss of the 1940s and 1950s has become the sexual intercourse of the ‘60s and ‘70s.”5 The effect on women has been dramatic. For those feminists who decried the fact that woman’s reproductive role made her a “prisoner of sex,” the Pill appeared as the key to freedom. “Without the full capacity to limit your own reproduction,” wrote Lucinda Cisler in Sisterhood Is Powerful, “a woman’s other freedoms are tantalizing mockeries that cannot be exercized.”6 But in the view of University of Michigan psychologist Judith Bardwick, instead of liberating women to enjoy sex, the Pill has replaced fear of pregnancy with fear of being used. “Far from giving young women the sexual license that men have so long enjoyed, the Pill has caused some women to resent male freedom even more,” Bardwick stated. “Far from alleviating anxiety over sexual use of the body, the Pill has exacerbated it.”7 The pill notwithstanding, unwanted pregnancies still occur by the tens of thousands, and the fight over legalization of abortion-on demand remains on center stage. And, the effects of long-term use of the Pill, which acts to prevent ovulation, are now a matter of public record. The changed hormonal balance caused by the Pill is blamed for headaches and weight gain in some women. British and other medical studies have found a connection between the Pill and the formation of blood clots that can cause strokes as well as an increased susceptibility to various forms of uterine cancer. Successive generations of female contraceptives — oral, sub-dermal and all the rest — have become even more potent and questionable in their long-term effect. It should not be surprising to find that as of the 1970s female suicide was on the rise in the United States. Though it has always been the case that more men than women kill themselves, trends had begun to change in certain large cities. In Los Angeles, for example, whereas in 1960 of those who committed suicide 35 percent were women, by 1970 the percentage of women among suicides had jumped to 45 percent.8 Another indication that women had begun to experience more conflict came from a University of Wisconsin study during the same period, which found that women psychiatric patients complained of more anxiety, depression, alienation and inability to cope with stress than did their counterparts of ten years earlier."
Brother I don't completely agree with you. Woman are already given liberation. And it is still expanding. Woman can do everything that men can. Why this debate?

My issue lies with people casually throwing around words like feminism and patriarchy without actually knowing the true meaning behind the ideology. I hope this video clears it for them. because for far too long bollywood is trying to condition and manipulate the audience with an agenda of fake feminism. It has become cool to use these words and comment women *tea emoji. from a 12 year old to a 30 year old on Instagram. everyone wants to speak on a topic where they have less idea about.
"Not against Feminism but Dhruv is complete left wing agent 
He showed the statement from garud puran but  not from quran  4:54 that men and women can't be equal .
1. Women wearing hijab forcefully from child ,multiple marriages for men ,women can't have divorce rights etc. 
Didn't showed a woman in hijab but in a bindi 4:47 that's how he simply soft influence people and talks about fact with his propaganda against one specific religion."
"you are the only hope , its strange how people dont hate people who openly called genocide but they triggered suddenly regarding feminism ..the anger against feminism is rooted in mysogyny and sexism .its about fear of losing control on female sexuality and her resources and her labour ( emotional and physical)  many youtubers have made their career around bashing women and feminism because everyone wants to see feminist women to be taugh a lesson ..they derive sadistic pleasure in it ..these are the same people who make fun of men if those men are emotional and have suffered some sexual abuse in past but whenever people discuss about feminsim , these people  use example of these victimised men to downplay the violence on women so that women should stop voicing their problems ..."
"15:34 at this moment, I'm convinced that it's nothing more than propaganda 🫠 and in this whole video you didn't talk about toxic feminism 🙄"

I am proud to say that I am a feminist male 😇
Very Informative video and must needed in todays scenario . I just want to mention one more point in end. Not just chappri guys are connecting this incidents to feminism but some chappri girls also do same with other irrelevant sources.

Galat h tu.. i agree with the point that feminism is different thing but the whol thing is that in the current period societies are getting influenced from news social media movies etc etc.. and develop the perception that feminism represents these things.. thats why people started using feminism word for pseudo feminism.. and the actual feminism is forgotten by society

"Dear Dhruv sir 
The video was accurately defined the true meaning of feminism and i truly appreciate this but I wanted to share something that not only boys but some girls on social media also have the wrong idea of feminism. Some girls calling themselves feminist have ideology that they can have freedom on everything and yes it is their ideology that they don't need a man and many things. I really felt disappointed after watching this video because i felt it was the half story, there are also some fake chhapri feminist who really don't care about actual rights and actual fights feminist are fighting for rather they are fighting for things which are personally beneficial to them. I really wanted you to talk about that part of the society too. This video is incomplete and i really wanted you and your team to look into this. But the video was very well done."

"Just saying, if feminism really focuses on gender equality, why feminists never raise their voice against the bias against male in divorce matters, why they don't raise voice against how easily the r*pe laws can be used to falsely accuse a male into a case esp in POSCO, why not raise voice against the fact that govt exams like JEE takes less fees from female students, why they don't raise voice against the fact that buses tickets are free for girls in some regions, shouldn't tickets be free for poors regardless of their gender.... If all Of these were otherway round people like you would hav gone crazy...
There are a lot of things in society which goes bias against women and make them look small, I completely agree but the same happens other way round too like how teachers gives harsher punishments to boys in school for a thing compared to girls.... The Difference is thnx to feminism govt has removed most of laws that are against women which is good... But the other way round is yet to happen as thnx to feminism it never gets a loud voice... If crciketers like shami has suffered so much becoz of how indian society and laws acts against male in divorce matters, just think how problematic this must be in lower level

Even those stupid alphas and tate fanbase never talks about these issue men face they are just busy with their toxic patriarchal mindset

Feminism played a huge role to provide women equal rights in past and I totally respect that, not only they helped women to get the rights but even helped men as you said.... But there is no need of feminism now esp in national level (in rural yes)... Coz u can't just say feminism means Gender equality... Better to use the literal world ""gender equality"" itself instead...."
Toxic feminism is a threat to this world and it drags attention from some real issues which some women are facing in this world.
"OPINION: I agree with 90% of the things you say here, but not completely on the part where you say males are females are similar therefore they should get equal rights. No, I believe if we are similar we should get similar rights, I believe that the biggest inequality is to treat unequal things equally. I believe in equity not complete equality. For example, men and women must have different dressing standards, we can not let women to move around topless in the names of giving equal rights as men, if i am hiring someone, and i see a man and a women and the man is more skilled but the women is suffering financially, i will recruit the women not in the name of equality but equity, if I'm recruiting someone for military purposes, i wouldn't hire equal amount of women in the name of equality as biologically men are more capable in this aspect, i wouldn't let a women suffer beyond her biological capabilities and wise versa. I believe rights should be equal in maximum areas and we need to have a objective reasoning with which we decide which rights should be given for women and for men such that it is providing justice for both genders. I believe in feminism if it means equity not complete A to Z equality as it can be unjust and unfair to women and men. Correct me if I'm wrong."

i have a request for a video about the lgbtqia+ and trans community, i mean, the motive of these communities is to make the society accept them, but yeah, there is still a lot of hate against these communities, the comment sections of lgbt and trans videos are full of hatred and i have a genuine question why some religions discourage sex other than hetrosexual sex. this is a issue to consider and spread awareness about if we are talking about equality. we should also have a video on other lgbt and trans community, with an unbiased opinion, clearing misunderstandings of the people.
please consider this! i appreciate that!

"So many insecure men are feeling threatened by feminism because if they can’t control women physically and financially, they’re scared no woman will ever want them and want to stay with them in a marriage. 
If women who have opportunities and legal protection scares and triggers you, I’m sorry, but you’re the problem and need to work on yourself. 

If you have nothing to offer as a man, don’t blame feminism. Strong and confident men aren’t threatened by equal partners.

Look at Dhruv and his wife. She’s sweet, she’s kind, she cooks and bakes, but she’s also a doctor."

"So glad you made this video ! It astonishes me that even my own mother cant understand these points when i try to talk to her about anything ! as a guy i have to suffer through all this shitt, and every girl who literally asks you your bank balance or govt. job status is not a feminist ! This is such a huge problem and both guys and girls are biggest culprits of it ! We live in an era of toxic andrew tits masculinity and onlyfans feminism ! I honestly dont even feel depresso being alone anymore ! Its just so tiring ! people dont even wanna listen to you , let alone make them understand ! and 1 thing i think you missed slightly when you said ""tradition"" is religion is a huge part of it , and seeing how much weight we give to religion in our lives over simple humanitism is a clear example of how hard it is to deal with this issue ! I recently met a girl and talked to her what kind of a guy she wanted ! she told me she want someone who dont have a problem with her earning money and working and dont want him to earn more than me to assert any sort of dominance in our relationship, but after a while she again countered this and told me ""well financial stability is very important to her"" and she wouldnt wanna marry anyone who is earning even equal to her, so probably a guy who is earning lot more than her, See the confusion ? , and just like that men are fuckin confused as well ! ""Arre bhai house wife is the best , tu paisa kamaega wo ghar ka kaam kregi"" Ok fine ! but these guys are also the same people who have trouble accepting that then all your money belongs to hers as well just as equally , if she wants to spend some of it on herself why is a basis of fights between them ? yes honesty is important and both should manage their finances together ! Tum chahte ho ladki kamayi na kre but kuch kharche bhi na kre ? aab saare paise sirf tumhare ho gaye ? Yea i know there are shitt women out there , and lot of fake rape and domestic violence cases to just snatch property from men and dont wanna work at all themselves, But again ! If you say ""saari ladkiya aisi he hoti hai"" then accept ""saare ladke bhi aise rapist or violent he hote hain""."
Thumbnail aur title change hogia😅
498A has been repeatedly exploited by women please make a video on this.
"thing is feminism is like a change in society ways...for it to work for both genders, both need to help eachother...just like woman should not expect her husband to be atm machine"
Hazrat ayesha r.a. greatest scholar of islam. Hazrat khadijah a powerful business women for her time. Inheritance rights already given to women in quran. Queen of sheeba mentioned in quran a powerful queen of a vast kingdom of her time and a woman of wisdom and intelligence. Quran no where forbids women from having access to education and jobs provided that modesty probity isnt compromised. A woman a wife is obliged to be obedient to her husband provided that her husband fulfills her basic needs clothes food etc. If not then she isnt obliged to obey him. In the feets of mother lies the heaven.
I felt it similar to Emma Watson speech in her he for she campaign but it is nice.

No government job as a men no girl no respect in India even family
"Others on 14 Feb❤🎉 
Meanwhile Dhruv on 14 Feb🗿"
Brother women are misusing femenism
In my opinion this is the second video of Dhruv Rathee what is spreading wrong education.
Meri wife mere se zyada kamati hai lekin hamare beech aisi koi baat nahi hai
"i always see your videos its a request 
please bhai dont called salman rushdei as a legendry author...he is a betrayer of 1.3 billion people ...

"I'm believing in equal right and Justice but nowadays 70% girl's are not only feminist, they belive as a feminist whatever they want they can do, useing the name of feminist, so i'm against those feminist, but not against the real feminist"

"Thanks a lot Dhruv...today you won our heart ❤❤..
Some patriarchal people scare from feminism.. because they know about their capabilities...
And Nowdays some patriarchal men are continuing their thoughts in the name of religion , dharam and culture...the most of the thing is that in our hindu religion this discrimination were never ever written...and some show cringe reels what boys are also doing
And yes this kind of men or people cannot progress in their life ...their life start from social medial and end in social media.....
Thanks again for this masterpiece...and yes some will learn and some will keep hating because slowly slowly their position is also getting reduced..
I am a feminist ❤❤for sure ❤️🙏"

कोन कोन dhruv rathi ko दिल से support karta hai
"Tum sahi bol rhe hooo lekin Muslim countries ke bare me bolo
Burka ke bare me bolo"
I watched full video...here you explained what is the actually meaning of feminism in theorywise but in the age of social media our youth used to see other things and that such some bad things people relate with feminism that is why the actual problem
Educated people respect dhruv rathe 😄
"Hey let's try to be feminist, for real this time k😊"
Great video 😊
"I like how dhruvdidn't even criticize films like ""thanks for coming"" which clearly portrayed feminism in a completely absurd way and instead roasted men for criticizing it 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂"
"Humble request to make a video on ""*miss use of legal  laws by wife's on their husbands*"". Please a humble request."
Love your each valuable things from you❤
A video on LGBTQ community now?
I accept all the things🙌 but men are brave❤ btw I'm a feminists✌
Very nicely explained ❤
"Dhruv bhaiya explained feminism very perfectly, but please do not use the word ""chhapri"" (24:00) in your videos as it is also a name of caste."
A girl carry more easteogen than Man.. we are defferent. They dont thik the way Man think.. its not same.. but equal rights should be there
Dhruv bhai teeen bar kyu badla thumnail 🤔🤔
Love this ❤
"when i clicked on this video it had 174k views and by the time the vid ended, it had 250k views lmao"
Rathee Sir ne title bhi change kar diya abhi hii @dhruvrathee
Good jab sir ❤
When thumbnail changed from Gopi bahu to ranveer kapoor 💀
No way racism and disability 😭 the examples 💀🌑
When I saw the thumbnail I thought your video was about “Fake Rape Culture” but I was wrong 😑 …
bro is changing thumbnails faster than people change their genders
3 times change kar liya thumbnail
😌 what a master piece 👌
"Animal d  kgf ,low class people watch these shit."
Make a video on how some rights are misused against men ...🙌💯
"Waah Dhruv Rathee  tumne baaki sab acche se bataye but still toxic feminism yaa pseudo feminism ki baat nhi ki 😂😂😂
We are against feminist we against toxic and fake feminist who insta ke chapri ladke fake feminist ko feminism bolege mgr hum nahi"
So many views in less than one hour congrats man love your content it is very informative thanks to you good luck
Just one word for your video dhruv bhai = *'Eyeopener'*
"Hope this video will open eyes of some people(sorry the word should be 'many people')and they understand the meaning and difference between feminism, masculinism etc... 😊"
Yes women needs equal rights but not extra( reservation and sympathy also why??) Its much problomatic to man ..
Hats off to this man ✅✅✅✅
No Comments 😂😂😂
Animal ek movie hai kisi ek person ki thoughts hai..phir bhi mujhe nahin lagta ki aapne animal movie dekhe honge.
"I am so glad by seeing that my thoughts are actually matching with it. You made it crystal clear , now I have that confident words that feminism is not dangerous. I am a woman but I felt that mens are also not happy with patriarchy. Thank you for simplifying all about it. Lots of love and respect to you Dhruv Sir and hats off to Team DR.😊😇"
Best video 👏👏
Dhruv bhai is also Feminist
"Im totally agree with your all points par apki hypocrisy dikhata hu mai 😅 apne sati pratha par baat ki which is right point par apne tripple talak ,halala, equal property rights unpar to baat ki nahi 😅 pakade jate ho rathee ji ."

Good bro
But there was a movement named 'free the nipple' and they said that they are feminist
"This topic is same as 'Jo chacha hai wahi bhatija hai, Never ending topic"
Bhai farmers protest prr video banao
Bhai acha nak se thumbnail change Q kiya 😂
"You miss few points:
1) Evolution science: Gender roles.Huge issue 
2) Psychological issues: Male and female attraction 
3) Racism in feminism 
4) War issue 
5)Voting issue: Most women influenced by their male counter part in terms of voting. We all understand  such thing
In a ideal situation feminism is really good.But We are human. We need leader.We need competition. And physical advantage and disadvantage always play big roles.Just calling myself feminist won't help anyone. So many fem*nist writer already talked about how much it’s problematic. 
If you don’t want patr*archal society, you have to choose matriarchy. You need leadership. It’s not that easy.
It’s not only in maintaining house or talking about bad things.We have deeper problem. 
Most company says they need more female workers because men can work outside but women can't.And then they create more competition among men. 
You insult male su*cide. Jobless, rejection in relationship, no help from society and family also lead huge suicide. Not everything related to patriarchy man.
I want women to have jobs and education. But they give less skilled women the scholarship and job Because they are women.That's not feminism."
Chhapriyo bura to nhi lag rha ? 😂🤣
Bilkul bekr movie 3rd class movie thi animal.. raddi ek dam

Anyone else noticed..? He changed his thumbnail three times..
"तुमको क्यों लगता है की तुमको सब पता है  और तुमको क्यों लगता है की तुम्हारे जैसे लोगों की strategy दुनिया के बहुत सारे लोग बहुत जल्दी नहीं समझ पाएंगे  serial  fake rape case filers पे video बनाओ, 80s के बाद से बनते चले जा रहे  female centric, male hater laws पे video बनाओ, और just अभी bns69  पे video बनाओ   DEEPIKA NARAYAN BHARDWAJ के साथ marathon podcast करो  कम से कम 3 घंटे का  तुम्हें तुम्हारी हद पता चल जायेगी"

Disagreed with many things in this video
"13:48 to 13:50 This statement made me laugh!🤣🤣 ""Animal Film ke Ranvijay jaisa hai!""🤣🤣 Appreciated this video.🌸"
"🛑 IS VIDEO ME AADHI BAT SACH OR THODI GALAT LAGTI HAI 
1 MEN AND WOMEN ARE BIOLOGICAL, PHYCHOLOGICAL, AND PHYSICALLY ARE DIFFERENT. THAT'S WHY MEN GET MORE MONEY THEN WOME BECAUSE THIER WORKING EFFENCY AND POTENTIAL IS MORE THAT WOMEN .
2 EVEN THOUGH WOMEN SHOULD EDUCATE THEM SELF BUT DON'T EVER TRY TO CROSS THEIR LIMITS AND SAY THAT MAN SHOULD NOT WORK HARD ON THEM SELF. 
3 Feminism IS SO MUCH CONFUSION LBGTQ+ AND FEMINIST THEIR SPEECH ARE SAME. THEY TELL TO MEN THAT THEY SHOULD NOT WORK HARD ON THEM SELF AND TELLING THAT IT IS OK TO BE WEAK. MEN HAVE AGGRESSIVE Mood IN  THEM SELF 
THIS IS THE WAY HOW THEY CAN PROTECT THEIR FAMILY. BUT THEY SHOULD KNOW HOW TO CONTROL THEIR EMOTIONS.
3 WOMEN ARE GETTING LESS PAID BECAUSE THEIR WORKING EFFENCY IS LESS THAN MEN. 
4 MEN ARE NOT EMOTIONAL SOCIETY IS MAKING THEM EMOTIONAL AND WEAK.
I DON'T HAVE ANY WORD THAT IT IS GOOD OR BAD. BECAUSE IT IS TOO MUCH CONFUSING
🛑 PLEASE NEXT VIDEO ON LBGTQ+🏳️‍🌈"

"Bhai pehle wala thumbnail aur title achha tha
Edit :- Dhruv saw my comment and changed the thumbnail to previous one 😮 can't believe it 😂"
Arey bhai kehna kya chahte ho.............??
"While I largely agree with what you said in this video. I believe the misandrists masquerading as feminist are also a reality now and these people are not an ignorable minority. You could find easily find such podcasts with Lacs of views of youtube. Similarly, there are several misogynists wearing the cape of men's rights activist with Lacs of views on YouTube. Due to power of social media, these anti-social people have gained an immense following and power and need to be called out.

Also, I don't like the fact that whenever you have to call out some indecent people you call them Chhapri. Chhapri is a very backward and oppressed caste and people need more awareness about them. I believe you should also address this in one of your videos. There are several derogatory terms and slangs on internet that are basically an oppressed caste or sect that peole don't know about."
Sir aap ka minute me thumbnail change ho raha hai
But equality is impossible in reality
Thank you Dhruv sir. I really needed this video content quality because of my topic in sociology in college which I was really unable to understand.
""" THE PROBLEMS OF CHILDREN BORN THROUGH ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION ""

The goal of the feminist movement was to make women equal to men in every respect. But this did not happen in practice. The feminist movement has completely failed in achieving its real objective. An American lady, Ti-Grace Atkinson says: “There is no movement. Movement means going some place, and the movement is not going anywhere. It hasn’t accomplished anything.”23 Due to this experience, feminist extremists in western countries demand a complete withdrawal from dependence on men, including sexual ties. Village Voice columnist Jill Johnston, for example, insists that “feminism is lesbianism,” and that it is only when women do not rely upon men to fulfill their sexual needs that they are finally free of masculine control.24 Living together like husbands and wives is not so simple a matter. Many problems have to be faced. For instance, if the couples want a child, how to find one? Modern medical science has provided the answer in the form of artificial insemination. Two women from Holland, Paula Deijs and Jeanine Haaksman lived together like husband and wife. Then they felt a desire to have a child. For this purpose they contacted the Lydden Institute of Birth Control. Their first attempt did not succeed, but in the second attempt Paula Deijs became pregnant. Through the semen of an unknown person a child was born to them. The child was named Thomas. But after the birth of the child they realized they again were in need of the same “man” whom they had shunned to become lesbians. The women are sensitive to the fact that Thomas needs men as role models. Uncles, a grandfather, brothers-in-law and male neighbours are encouraged to visit frequently. “We have a good friend not too far from here that we have chosen to be a father image for Thomas,” says Haaksman. “We’ll send Thomas over to him for all the technical instructions.”25 Providing a “father” to Thomas in this artificial way is in no way an alternative to a real father. It is certain that some strangeness must remain between such “sons and fathers.” And when Thomas grows up, this unconscious strangeness will turn into conscious strangeness. Thomas will know his mother, but not his father. This vacuum in Thomas’s life will produce different kinds of mental complications, which will most probably make it impossible for him to become a useful member of society. It is as if in the system of lesbianism there is scope for producing girls but not boys. Even then, to produce a girl, lesbians will depend upon the same man whom they had rejected in order to have their own independent ways. It is easy to deviate from the system of nature but the price that has to be paid for such deviation is too high for an individual or a society."
"I wish every person of India , even not of India , it's thoughout the world has the same mentality and rites as Dhruv sir has....."
"The world's first Feminist was ""Rajmata Jijau"""
Animal good movie I am sorry par yahi sahi hai tq
Dhruv bhai ek vdo for kisan protest please please please please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thumbnail changed 😂
Also i just realized that most of the people who had problem with so called feminist on the issue of girl slapping poor guy had argument that what if at that place was a boy and that boy slaps a girl then hundreds of so called feminist wake up and start tweeting but on the issue of girl hitting boy no one came forward like not even real feminist people also. Thats where the major disappoint was. It was not against feminism rather it was against so called feminist people from the society.
"You are the real revolutionary of 21st century....who brings an idea of equality among mens and womens...what a great thoughts you have, you are the real human ❣✨"
Nice video Dhruv sir. In your animal video i did not agree with you for my reasons but this video make me proud of you. I don't know that will you see my coment or not  but this video was really very nice. Thanks sir 🙏

But tumhare ander itne guts nahi ki islam pe awaaz uthao 
Ye kya biasedness hai

Islam me ladkiyo ko kis tarah kaale pardo me dhak ke rehna aur teen talaak jaisi cheeze hai uske baare me toh ek shabd nahi bola tumne 

But garud puran jo iss yug ke liye likhi bhi nahi gayi thi use tum galat bata rahe ho"
Gopibahu wala Thumbnail change kr diye😂
Women looks good below the shoe of men 💪🏻💀
We all should call out those social media chapris and so called alpha males.
Who noticed background changed like here.........✓✓
And I had been very hardworking and good student my whole life has spoiled.
Dhruv rather is suberb❤❤
I don’t believe in equality because men do the most hard working in society men work in oil rig in military they fight in front line men discover phone cell Facebook YouTube internet compuet car tv extra men are the farmers. So why women should get paid as men if they do same hard work as men
Are log se jyada to apni bivi kahata hai aur ladkiyo ka bhav bahut badh jayegi kyuki ladki ghamandi hoti hai
"In traffic situation, you told what the character Ranavijay would do and I agree. Now tell me, what the character Sardar Khan would do in that situation?

"No patriarchy, no matriarchy, no feminism,be a humanist and respect all human beings..."
"Much needed video , the need of the hour 💯💯. Very well researched and presented."
"Such a worthiest video, I hope every single person should watch this video"
"Feminism is a very good movement , ideally it's a very good concept but due to misinformation people don't understand it.Also, social media is flooded with selective wrong feminist content where they shows some random self proclaimed feminist making weird illogical comments. Such content spreads the wrong meaning of feminism. The real feminist issues don't get highlighted on social media.  You will see so many videos about non binary gender debate and nowadays this gender debate is taking over the whole feminist movement. 
A lot of people who support patriarchy conveniently just use such wrong examples to delegitimise the whole feminist movement."

Feminism is against patriarchy and since patriarchy hurts men as well (not as much as women) then men must fight for feminism and feminists must fight for men ❤❤

So If womens and mens are same then why there are two types of men and women categories in all type of sports .According to those feminist Sports authorities should also change thier rules and have to start combine sports competitions for men and women . due to gender equality & then you will see those feminist will also start protesting against  this change in sports and they will also start demanding for a separate platform .😂😂

And misogynists like Jean jack Rousseau, Aristotle etc. 
They all carry.equal weightage in comparison to said topics. Neena Gupta galt nhi h usne face kiya h life me jo wohi bol Rahi h. I know, what discrimination created by society and what is naturally created by nature itself. We can't establish equilibrium by providing artificially which is a result of naturally. For example anger, love, hate, colour, height etc. 
If men have the power of masculinity then women have the power  of social manipulation or social maneuvering capacity. They are distinct qualities possessed by them and work differently. A woman can be as corrupt as a man if she is ensured that her population (Top position in managerial post) is far higher than men. Becoz absence of this she behaves like an innocent and lesser in terms of no. Of corrupt officials in the world. I understand, they(women) are more intelligent than us and it is known to earliest centuries even before the evolution of social contract theory and that's why some Male dominated priests evolve the concept of subjugation of their females.

no offence dawg but in the whole video I watched', this was the point I needed to debate about"
"Even though feminism technically means equality for men and women, one can apply their common sense to understand that the term does promote feminine rights over everyone else. This gets applied to individuals on a subconscious level. All I am trying to say is why not call it ""gender equality"" ? why stick to feminism ?"

"why do you show half statement, the actual teachings found in the Garuda Purana regarding the duties of a virtuous and devoted wife go like this. ""A virtuous wife is one who obeys her husband's orders, but this obedience does not entail blindly accepting wrong or immoral actions or decisions made by the husband. Instead, even in such situations, it is the duty of the wife to guide her husband towards righteousness and help him discern between right and wrong, thereby fulfilling her role as a supportive and morally upright life partner.""

This interpretation emphasizes the importance of mutual respect, understanding, and communication in marital relationships, highlighting the wife's responsibility to contribute positively to her husband's moral development and overall well-being. It promote the idea that a harmonious and fulfilling marriage is based on mutual cooperation, support, and ethical conduct by both partners. but you cut the statement to fit your needs."

Every movie with female lead acters is not necessarily a feminist movie. Same as every movie with a male lead is not necessarily misogynist. It can just be a normal movie with normal story. People think just because all lead actors are girls that means its feminist.  Nobody claimed series like 4 more shots as a feminist series. Its just a series about 4 friends and their life. Like dil chata hai or ZNMD. A movie with a feminist topic like thappad and pink are actual feminist movies. Their leads can be anyone. Its the topic and story that matters.
You're absolutely right.....!!! Only chhapris target Feminism even when there's no connection to it.

Bro why you changed thumbnail 😂
"21:15 here comes the main point of the video. Feminism by definition is indeed about equality but the modern interpretation promotes something else. Bad things are being promoted in the name of feminism these days. The old feminism was fine, but the modern one is too crazy. It encourages exactly such type of behaviour and more. It promotes hatred against men, even tho that is not feminism but still it can be seen happening in the name of feminism. I think the 2 terms feminism and modern feminism need to be talked about separately, because if you don’t divide feminism into old feminism and modern feminism and praise “feminism” in general pretending that only one type of feminism exists, then you will associate old feminism with modern day craziness of feminism, causing people to hate real feminism in general, which is supposed to be about equality. I believe you should have talked about the bad values which modern day “feminism “ promotes, more"
Now this is about humanism

Next if buddha is right do you think we must demand for abolishment of police and army?
Not every men fight to impress a girl Mr. Rathi it about ensuring equality and respect. This thinking of yours is nither rational nor just."
This will happen only  if gender equal rights come in our country

Hi
Dhruv is a simp
""" WOMAN VS MAN ""

In view of the divine law of balance, let us consider the relationship between man and woman. According to divine law, this relationship was set up on the principle of the division of labor, i.e. it is the responsibility of the man to carry out tasks outside the home, while the woman takes charge of tasks within the home. The Qur’an states that “men are the protectors and maintainers of women.”20 This does not make a man a woman’s superior, or her master. This only means that in running a home and bringing up a family, it is for the man, with his more active capabilities, to earn a living, deal with all official matters, and, when called upon, defend his country. A man is by nature more suited to such tasks, and that is why it is in the nature of things that they should be his responsibilities and not woman’s. The word qawwam in the above verse is an intensive form of qa’im meaning, “one who is responsible for or takes care of a thing or a person.” Thus the use of this word is indicative of the wisdom of the division of labor rather than the superiority of man over woman. It should be conceded that if the woman finds herself in a position of responsibility in running the home, it is because her more passive nature, her talent for household tasks, her gentleness and affection all fit her admirably for domesticity, to which she is certainly better adapted than her male counterpart. Since time immemorial life had been equably systemized by this division of labor. Earning a living had most often meant hunting, farming, fishing, working in orchards, transporting merchandise for barter or trading, all tasks physically difficult to perform, and, therefore, better and more easily done by men. While men were thus engaged, it was simply more practical for women to stay at home and manage the household. But with the advent of the industrial revolution, conditions were created which tended to break up this natural order, for now jobs came into existence which, to some extent, were suitable for women, and, since tradition in western countries did not require women to segregate themselves from men and live in seclusion, they came out of their homes and began working in offices and factories. Gradually, the traditional pattern of living began to change. Men were no longer the sole breadwinners: women had begun to share that responsibility. With economic independence came the realization in women that they should “break out of the shackles forged for them by men” to make new and independent lives for themselves. This trend in thinking eventually paved the way for the women’s liberation movement. Since feminism was given its first impetus by the industrial revolution, “women’s lib” began in those countries where industrialization had first made its appearance. The first noteworthy book to demand equal rights for women was published in London in 1792. Authored by Mary Wollstonecraft, it was entitled, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. The industrial revolution came later to America and that is why the women’s liberation movement did not begin there until the nineteenth century. With the progress of the industrial revolution, women’s liberation gained momentum, reaching its zenith in the 20th century. The upholders of this movement maintained that the cause of the difference existing between men and women in societies with ancient traditions lay not in nature but in a man-made social framework. Their contention was that a woman could do anything that a man could do, but that outdated social customs prevented her from coming into her own. They held that, once given the opportunity to demonstrate her capabilities, a woman would be able to work shoulder to shoulder with men in every walk of life. In no respect would she lag behind. This movement is now over two hundred years old and, in modem developed countries, it has been so successful that neither the law nor tradition now places the slightest obstacle in the path of women who wish to step into the shoes of men. Yet women still lag far behind men, there being very few instances of their having actually placed themselves on an equal footing with them. Encyclopaedia Britannica has this to say on the subject of women in modern society: In the economic sphere women who work outside the home are heavily concentrated in the lowest paying work and that having the lowest status. Women also earn less than men in the same kinds of jobs. The median pay of women workers in the U.S. was 60 percent that of men in 1982. In Japan the percentage of average pay was 55. Politically, women are greatly underrepresented in national and local government and in political parties.21 Today the social boundaries set by time-honored conventions have broken down, and all countries now have laws favoring equality of the sexes. Yet modern woman still finds herself on a lower rung than man, not having been able to achieve equal status in any of the economically or professionally important areas of modern living. This state of affairs would appear to indicate that, contrary to the women’s libbers’ way of thinking, social conditioning cannot be blamed for the centuries-old difference in the status of men and women. If this had been so, surely by the end of the 20th century women would have been enjoying an equal status with men. Obviously, we must search for the reasons elsewhere."

"The biological structures of men and women also matter
For example a man soldier will preferred over woman in war or border duty
Similarly a male labour will be better for tough works than women

Naturally kids emotionally feel more close to their mother
So the house hold is already a job that's why  it should be a woman choice either she want to job or not.
The film producer and pornography producers will support feminism in general way because they need woman to come out and make prophit for them by the label of freedom 

For me it is logically good if my sister, mother or wife go for a job because it will increase the income but I would not want because it is an extra burden on them."

"Pondering over many articles but I got sumptuous explanation on this topic here! Thank you to show the actual perspective,  but the saddest parts are, I think,  patriarchy is so highly integrated, many of us couldn't differentiate what is patriarchial  and what shouldn't; And ' little learning is dangerous thing' and social medias are now filled with this little-learners, that's why all this chaos.

There is one more topic which needs to be discussed and no one is talking about - most of the schools and teachers  judge a child through marks . Which is totally wrong. Getting less marks compare to any other  particular student does'nt mean that you're less intelligent. Marks really dont define any students worth . Can you please make a video on this topic talking about what kind of pressure this creates on the student and many other related issues

"History of word AURAT

The word ""aurat"" originally comes from the Arabic word ""awrah"". In Arabic, the words awrah or awrat denote defectiveness, imperfection, blemish, weakness, genitalia, loins, private parts, pudendum flaw, defect and fault.[3] According to Nurhan GÜNER avrat/avret in Turkish is borrowed from Arabic and is not related to Old Turkic uragut.[5] The word is used in the Quran to denote ""privacy"", ""vulnerability"" and ""nakedness"" as well.[3][better source needed][6][7] Aharôn Layiš' book on family laws among Druze attributes a quote to al-Tanukhi that says ""..Women are all nakedness (awrat) and all nakedness should be covered""[8] Moshe Piamenta, in his book ""Islam in Everyday Arabic Speech"", notes that in the language of the Bedouin, synecdochic usage of word 'awrat' denotes 'woman'.[9] In the Kurdish language, the word 'Aurat' for women is spelled as 'avarat' where as in (Ottoman) Turkish it is spelled as 'Avret'.[10]

Before entering South Asia, it was used in the Persian language in Iran to mean 'woman'. In Mohammad Moin's Persian dictionary, awrah has two different meanings: ""nakedness"" and ""young woman"". But subsequently, Iranians started avoiding the word ""aurat"" for 'women', due to its meaning of ""nakedness"". In (Ottoman) Turkish, the word 'avret' was used more for common married or adult women, whereas the word ""hatun"" was used for more respected women.[10] In Ottoman times any unmarried adolescent girl was called ""kiz"" and her silence was assumed as consent for marriage purposes. Kiz were freer and less controlled, but once married and considered avret their mobility and sexuality came under drastic social control, so that they would not engage in adultery, in order to preserve male right of lineage and patriarchal honor.[10] According to Heidi Stein avrat / avret meaning woman (Arab.“‘aurat, privy parts”) is among 78 early (9th to11th centuries) Arabic cultural words found it's way in everyday Turkish language during first Arabic linguistic import stage through Persian language.[11][12] In Turkish since the twentieth century, use of word avret has been limited to intimate body parts.[10] According to Pashayeva Gunel Bakhsheyish kizi and Musayeva Ilaha Ilham kizi (2019) The word ovrat in Arabic means a married woman, who has a husband; wife– avrat in Turkish language, avrad in Gagauz language, arvad in Azerbaijani.[13]: 34, 35  Kizi (2019) says sufix ""عار"" [ʻār] {noun} meaning shame (also: disgrace, dishonor, dishonour) too might have come from Arabic. The alternate etymological origin for 'arvad' may be arva (tare) meaning tearing of daughter's relationship from parents while getting married and it's root may be from Mongolian language lexems abra-arba-arva the root ab-av means magic, conjuring in Mongolian language"

"Influencer like you,is a blessing for us ❤️."
What a coincidence I was  Just reading about feminism and I got it
You just changed my mind. 😊
This is so true. I have seen the men in my family to pretend to be bold and tough but are actually crying inside. It is so sad that even men who follows patriarchy like their religion will be banished by the same patriarchy with just a drop of tear from their eyes.
You changed my mind sir though I was not a toxic masculine type man or that alpha type man you talked about. Somehow I thought that these toxic feminism is wrong and should be avoided but I never knew that was not feminism at all. This video taught me that There shouldn't be any term as toxic feminism. what we call as toxic feminism is just wrong. It is just a crime. And she should be punished. But the real feminism that you talked about in this video should be promoted and should get more limelight so that both men and women can get those benefit. Huge fan sir. Huge respect for you.

Best guys on YouTube....I love this guys
"brother , i appreciate you for making this video, however after seeing the video, tbh i felt many things are way off. i am quite not sure if its because of i might have some confirmation biases.
I used to promote feminism quite affirmatively and used tell i am a feminist proudly , but not anymore.

i am currently also seeing the other side of the story aswell.
i can proudly say certain aspect of feminism is right and currently i am kind of rejecting the notion of patriarchy itself.
Some of the things that are described in whatever podcast sounds very legit. 

So i would definitely suggest to break out of the echochamber listen other side of the story aswell without rejecting it over our confirmation biases, there is some value in it.
this suggestion is applicable to either side of this issue."
You explained well and said the reality ❤. Justified. Hat's off to you. Dhruv never disappoint
I love u dhruv bhai
Great
the thing is women dont do equal work...so why equal pay
Exceptionally outstanding work 🎉🎉 by our Dhruv bhai
Boss u should mention Mother Theresa..
mr.dhruv ASLI FEMINISM DUNIYAME NAHI HAI.......the ones go around calling themselves feminists are just women who want all the nice things of men and the tough jobs they want to have men continue doing them.
"Please upload a video on type of gender, It is very typical to understand these days"
Dhruv baya the only reason is the stupid laws in India....where a statement from a women is more powerful then of the men. U can argue all day but its just a fact
Zbrdsttt👏👏
Aurat word use maat kra kru
Aapki video bhoot achi hai but aapne gender word use kia hai 9 : 16 pe kyuki gender ek stereotypes word hai jo society expect  based hota hai toh sex word use krna tha aapko

Bhai sach kahu to ye ladka duniya ko alag tarike se dekhta hai ... ❣️🔥🔥🔥
Impressive.
This is one of the best videos you've made. 🎉🎉
Mindset is a choice. No amount of education can change anything if you don't choose to change. You choose to follow a patriarchal or feministic mindset. And if you don't like it you have to consciously make efforts on how you process and respond to things.

"I like dhruv raathi, but women do not get paid the same because they do not work the same, i am sorry but thats the truth, ofcource they should be paid for the same work done, but the work done is not the same, most of the time a man does more work, i am talking about corporate job or any other job where the same job is done by both genders but the quality of work is not the same.

Men work more hours and also more difficult jobs, i am sorry if it offends you but it is the truth, other than that i agree with dhruv raathi, he is amazing.

There are some jobs for women and some jobs for men.

Just like dhruv rathee said, we are similar not same, so ofcource there are going to be differences."

"When you are accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression."
"Reject toxicity in both genders, embrace the gender differences."
Ye to GOLD hai.............
"Feminist ko gaali ki tarh use krre h ajkl ladke.... 😢 Mere khud k saath bhot batamiji ki jb mene bhot kindly equality ki bat ki thi. Bhot pyar se. But bhot saare ladke ak comment section me akar batamiji krne lge
 Muje stress bhi ho gya tha. Jbki mene unme kuch reply nhi kiye ki mera bhi bhai h so i can't say anything wrong about men but wo galat ladke the. Patriarchal soch k the. Yha tak ki kaafi sare followers wala channel Instagram pr wo ladka bhi aise hi bate krra tha. Ab muje realise hua ki jese andhbhakt hai vese hi patriarchal society bhi hai. Jo apko darayegi. Galat bolenge. Taaki aap (girls) aage na bde. M kbhi nhi chahti ki ladko k sath galat ho bs Hume hmare rights equality chaiye"
Every day video dalo mujhe bahut pasand hai ❤❤❤
Another video on Kisan Andolan 2 please

This is the reality of society but I am the luckiest one girl that I have a best parents and I am one and only daughter of them. They said me: you are a both girl and boy of our because they don't believe in gender inequality

😂 This guy is part of the problem. I thought he is gonna talk about male issues for once but he still twisted it as it is a man's fault and women are somehow always victims. Wow. Guys like this are the reason men are not opening up about their problems.
"The well-known American novelist and a leader of the feminist movement, Rhoda Lerman, visited India in 1987. The Times of India published her interview, which is reproduced here: “I come with very bad news,” says Rhoda Lerman. Speaking on the changing role of women in society, she revealed that 77 percent of the poor in America are women and children. The reason she offers is the high wage differential between the earnings of men and women. Women earn 62 percent of what men earn, merely because of the “pink-collared” jobs offered to them. “Equal opportunities and equal pay for equal work are just a myth,” she declares. Women have been able to infiltrate only the lower and middle management and are offered innumerable jobs in food chains and the secretarial cadres. This discrimination, she believes, is due to the male bias which works against women, branding them as ‘undependable, since they go in for maternity leave and have children.’ Although 96 percent of the working women have children, only 67 percent of them can enjoy maternity leave, without fear of jeopardising their jobs. However, seniority almost always suffers, says Ms. Lerman. “Maternity and child care are the cause of high wage differentials,” she adds, “economic reality having nothing to do with spiritual equality.” Activists had clamored for sexual equality and abortion rights and won them, without anticipating the economic backlash that would ensue. With radical feminism accepted as the code, women are treated as equal, without any concessions to their biological differences. For instance, one out of two marriages in America is ending in divorce, with the responsibility of childcare devolving on the mother alone. Alimony and maintenance are merely laws, rarely put into practice. A mere 5-10 percent of the men pay maintenance, and that too, only for the first year. For the rest, the burden is borne solely by the mother. Thus, the quality of life of a divorced woman reduces by 73 percent and that of a man increases by 43 percent. Single households, headed by women trying to play the role of “super-moms,” are on the increase, she revealed. In the next ten years, therefore, 40-50 percent of the children will be living in female-headed households, an unhealthy phenomenon, which has its repercussions in increased suicides amongst children. “Due to a lapse in the dependency structure, suicide is becoming endemic amongst children,” she said. Socialist feminism, which takes into account the intrinsic differences between men and women, is the call of the hour, Ms. Lerman believes. We have had an excess of the American dream — of a husband who works, a house in the suburbs, two children, two cars and a mother who stays at home and bakes cookies. With the family structure falling apart, she feels that only government support in the form of day-care centers, maternity leave benefits and subsidies to override the economic limitations of single women can hold the social fabric together. “Otherwise, our victories will be merely Pyrrhic victories,”34 she predicts, similar, perhaps to the freedom experienced on the funeral pyre.’35 The feminist leader has acknowledged that the successes of feminism are little short of Pyrrhic victories. This is the most appropriate word to describe the victory of modem woman. She secured “equality” after a long and hard struggle. In the process, however, of achieving this imaginary equality, she has lost everything. Ms. Lerman feels that only large-scale government support can compensate for the deprivation of western women. This means placing herself under the guardianship of a government, which is completely in the hands of man. Woman was not willing to accept the guardianship of man at home; at her own cost, she has had to come to terms with the guardianship of men in the government."
I completely agree with Dhruv Rathee about feminism but why can't you use the same agressive tone for pseudo feminists which you use for chhapri boys
"I don't agree with all the points
This is how America's gender problems started and it is now where it is
It's not the patriarchal society that makes all the men how he is.
Its the biology of a man
I am all for equality don't get me wrong but I am just saying both are different. Built different, have different roles, can perform different task."

Thanks a lot
This man is a legend like i learned so many things from this video. He  is🗿
"Huge respect sir , but why pink in background?"

Hats off brother 🙌
legend
You ask at 25:51 'Kya kisi feminist ne is ladki ko support dikhaya?'. Let me remind the definition of feminism you gave earlier in the video. The question should be 'Kyu kisi feminist ne is ladki ka bahiskar nahi kiya?' Equal rights ki baat haina? Woh ladke k rights k liye kyu nahi khade hue feminist log?
Bro you won my heart what the great topics you raise is such a wonder moment to watch out for
😊😊😊

THANKYOU so much sirr....i was so tired of seeing comments about feminism under any irrelevant video. ..and they start criticising .....this was so much needed...a real feminist does not do those things that are being related by it....its just that people dont want to adapt this mindset...!!
Ye hota hai influence karna ek positive approach se❤
"Hey bhagwan, jab agar Dhurv Rathee bana hi rahe the toh do teen million aur bana dete. XD Sigh. Julie lucked out"
"Dhruve raathi Your great

"Dhruv Bhai Sandeshkhali, West Bengal ke upar ek video banao"
Esa nahi h sir ki hm nahi chahte ldkiyo ko equal rights mile hm chahte h sbko equal rights mile but sir kuch ldkiya sb nahi bs kuch ldkiya esi h jo feminism ka galt fyda uthati h galt hokr v shi banne lagti h
Before I watch this video I want to say feminism is right but as not all people are same so few use it in their favour. We should be thoughtful of how to handle it when someone misuse it but also shouldn't get against it in such cases just because of few bad examples.
I have no enemies...no one in this world deserves to be hurt~vinland saga
I like how he called out the chapris/alphas of social media. Great job.
