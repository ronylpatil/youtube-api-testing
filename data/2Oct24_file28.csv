"Yes feminism is right..
But taking its misadventures is wrong like in lakhnow case in you tube they may have not supported the girl but can u guarantee that if may had slapped her back they have supported,even the people had come in favour of girl if man had slapped first and they themselves had kicked a guy had anyone did anything to girl..
Y reservation if u are supporting faminisum and asking for equal rights ,y u didn't support uniform civil code,y u didn't have that guts to speak on that..?being selective is easy"

Dhruv IтАЩve been a true supporter of your work and thatтАЩs why IтАЩm sharing my true feedback that it was a little disappointing for me as I was expecting that you would discuss the issue of тАШpseudo feminismтАЩ in this video as well."

"Feminism is never about equality, It's for power and vengeance,

If they're granted equality then they will cry to death,

Men are mentally weak and easy manipulated but since they have set the false narrative of strong you will never believe that all you have is a false sense of control bros, Open your eyes bros."
"Idk why but i am getting a feeling that this video was biased an Dhruv spoke about the dark side of mens, but didn't about the dark side of womens and how mens have been harrassed or tortured mentally by the society and females for even the smallest of things like having a seat or slight push due to braking in public transport"

Strongly believe ЁЯТп
"This society now needs a modern solution because modern problem requires mordern solution . Society needs equaliism more than femalism because feminism only highlights women's equal rights and society forgets about men's rights . And just like in the video stated that some Alfa's are definiting femanism in wrong way but there are also some ' feminists ' definiting feminism in wrong ways . Like "" Always respect a woman ."" It's seems like mantioning that no matter how a woman act rude , as a man , he should treat her respectfully . ( That's what some Alfa's and ' Femanists ' think ) ( as an example )"
You didn't understand neena gupta's point of view. She didnt say woman are less than man. She meant to say we arent equal. She didnt mean that women cant earn or shouldn't earn.
"1:27 SUCH A GOOD POINT. This is what needs to be implemented in our minds more. It's not men vs women, no do us women want authority over men. It's about EQUALITY. Not treat someone differently on the basis of their gender. The division is not between genders it's between people who understand equality and basic human rights for both genders, and people who simply don't."

"If feminism actually means equal opportunities for both men and women, regardless of outcomes, I support it. But the problem is the word itself is creates misconceptions. Whenever someone hears the word 'feminism' the first thing that comes to his mind is something only dedicated to the 'female team' of the human race."

Fine but you're still not talking about pseudo feminism
Women were given equal rights.. movement started in 70s.. Behind the movement was Rothschild family.. reason was to get other half (females) to start working and pay taxes $s.. As men & women work kids are left to be raised by state... This is the master plan by those to control the world... They are running their narrative.. sad but true.. society is crumbling.. you can ignore this comment or open your eyes and look deep

"No bro sorry your one information is wrong about when feminism started. Not in 1980's it was in the 6th century. The first ever modern state, state of Madina where rights were given to women men all equal. Children rights aged people rights etc these everything was introduced first time there. And all devil's forces are still against that system. That system is the system of Quran system of Islam System given to us by our Creator."
Women and men are equal. The balance should be equal. Some places where women got priorities and in some places men got. Thats how they are equal rights. Equal rights doesn't mean tomorrow a man demands to get pregnant. Or woman start demanding to make another woman pragnant etc. When you buy a kilo of rice to balance it you use stone of 1 kilo on other side you dont balance it with another kilo of rice on other side of balance.
Feminism is the most misused term.

Dhruv sir i am your big fan but the man is always less emotional than a woman that makes a man stronger to survive and be there for closed ones. Literally this is my observation and i have found that 95% of woman who start earning they claim that i earn by myself i do by myself I donтАЩt need anyone in my life even though she always disrespects his husband if she starts earning herself. And man always thinks about his family his closed ones first after earning

Feminist are those who support false case fillings against men. As per NCRB data only 20 percent of 498a i.e harrasment of women for dowry lead to conviction... 80 percent cases are false.. Legal Extortion as denoted by supreme court. HOW YOU DIFFERENTIATE THEAE FEMINIST  to othera.. see the es head of NCW  Swati Maliwal who falsely complained against her father against AAP official

"I want to add one more point dhruv. 
I see around and notice that in most of the cases the husband died and the wife is alive after him for maybe 5-25 years. I feel that this is also because of patriarchy. Men Don't share their emotions as they are taught to be strong and God knows what. So they keep it with them. Hence it affects their health. Stress and heart attack whereas a woman is over expressive. Sharing her things with almost everyone. So she doesn't carry this load on her mind and body. Hence live long. 
Waiting for your thoughts on thia"
Great video Dhruv! Facts spoken.

Good sir
I have grown up in the тАЬfeminist North KoreaтАЭ aka Norway. I can tell you that feminism is evil. The problem is when you give women high positions they become arrogant and selfish. Women in high positions like to rule because itтАЩs benefits their own egos. I have seen it with my own eyes and India should not do the same stupid mistakes we in the west have done.
"China,USA,Russian and Europe struggling to bring back women home.
family system end there, due to this equal drama.
these countries run by asian who still have family system alive.
In asia we know what women should do and what men should do and good news is it's working."
"No feminist hv supported the violence against men but no feminist hv criticized the same.
Keeping silent is one kind of support towards feminism against men. 
Situation if get vise versa went a men hits a women and all the feminist will support the women but no feminist will support or speak a word against the women when she do the same.
So, being silent is kind of being supportive to such act. 
So call feminist..."

"Weak people use tradition, culture and religion to suppress the one who is capable. Tell abp to read the right garud puran and specify the meaning properly before bashing a puran. Fear of shame is a business now. Once heard a sentence ""we as a society  are goign retard"" I can definitely feel it now. I only see these important discussions either on yt, twitter or comment section but on regular life people are either quite, suppressed or the one who wants to have a debate for positive change Will be avoided, everybody wants change but they won't work for it."

"in the name of feminism world is facing toxicity higher divorce ratio higher SINGLE MOM ratio and low marriage ratio, if your mentally feminine, you cannot expect everyone to be the same majority follows masculinity and it is hard to be masculine cause it requires alot of hard work, and if you say TOXIC masculinity there is no such thing as that, and last but not the least point out a country where you see higher rates of feminism and the govt laws are according to feminism MEN in those countries run away from there, INSTANTLY, it's HAPPENING have a look at america men do not wanna get settled with an american woman, the movement started MGTOW communities like RED PILL, have a look of the deep side you cannot act like a robot bring out history while the real effects are showing in present, a smart man like you leaving loop holes, sad"
"For the diversty,rights should be given diverse;
And if there is something like equal rights then there will be,""equal fights"".
It whould not be qouta but merit into the race.
And though,war and politics strategies are in the genes of  man as they have suffered and gone throughout the history.
So a man wouldnt let his wife fight against a predator because she is weak and not made for that.
Look,this world is example for those who believe in absolute feminism,
            ""Women are more in numbers than male and have remained like that so why they have not the leadership of the world ""and this makes clear that the one who is made for what,will do better in that and thats why woman are better in parenting and household and the man is better in earning and protection.
Both are leaders at the time.
Women should have the equal rights but in the sense of judiciary and votes,and in those where equality can place its feet.
Actually it should not be equality given but accurate equality,accorfing to the measure."

Idk wtf is this dude live under a rock most likely no one has problem with equality if they had it wasn't ever approved in the first place the problem is the modern feminist who changed what feminist meant when it was created by in the day. This guy think he's smart but the dumbest person on the internet who uses chat gpt to make his content and brainwash people
"dude you're ЁЯдб. saying men and women are same and equal then later in the video proved himself how different we are. Men and women are really different from each other the behavior, emotions, strength, and mental strength.

Men and women isn't equal and never will be this stupid fight will go on forever until we accept this fact. If they want equality then why aren't they working in every single fields why only taking office jobs. These feminists only wants equality where it's benefiting them."
Jo galat karega use galat kaha jaeyga. Femenism ke nnaam par aaj ladies  bhi bahot saare galat kaam kar rhi hai. Tumne poore video mein sirf man ko galat kaha jo ki galat hai. Sirf ek side lena acchi baat nahin hain

"After I understood this, something came to mind...Who are we OR AM I to judge what woman should get rights...We both as MAN and WOMAN both naturally born with all the rights to have without asking for a permission. Than one would say, this is Feminism. But no we dont deserve to chose give rights to any body, we naturally born with it. So let's say a Man should think above Matriarchy...And women should....:) let's them decide. Than that's how I believe things will be naturally in normal to enjoy the beauty of life."
You can't play on both sides of the wicket. Feminism and Sympathy as and when needed.
"About male earning more than female i guess it is not exactly necessary. But us female at some point has to take a break from our career and go thru pregnancy, give birth, take care of that small child so there is a gap and now, there is another member added to a family who is very fragile and there will be a lot of hospital bills until a baby hits age of 3 or 4. It depends on individuals if they wanna go back after 1 year. But personally I would work too but my work wouldn't consume my whole time as it's crucial to be with a child during their mind and body developing phase. It's not exactly related to patriarchy, I'd say it is more about inflation and hospital bills and well being and protection of a small child that you gave birth too.

Also, I don't mind him earning less as long as we are quiet stable to pay for anything that is needed and don't have to run for a loan."

"""Women must be paid as much as men"". Yeah sure, when she's doing enough works a men doing. 
Equality doesn't apply everywhere. If everyone were equal then why sometimes it happens that a guy working for 4 years for a company doesn't get any promotion where a new guy gets it. That's where talent matters. Everyone cannot be the manager, it's not about men or women it's about their abilities.
World's fastest women could never beat Usain Bolt. It's natural, women aren't built as strong as men. 
I don't mean to say they aren't supposed to do that, they sure can. Everyone has the freedom, we've moved on from the past you're talking about. But you're wrong about being equal. Everyone must get what he deserves, not equal."

"You talked about feminism wonderfully. I support real feminism but what about toxic feminism ? Nowadays feminism has come down from rights to clothes ? You can't deny it! I'm a Muslim woman living in a first world country doing a job and earning more than I need but women themselves look down on me, why ? Because I wear a HIJAB! How is a hijab a sign of patriarchy? Asian women European women condemn me mock me for wearing a hijab they say it is stopping me erasing me. But how ? I'm wearing it willingly I love wearing hijab I love practicing my religion I feel empowered covering myself but it doesn't mean I'm a helpless woman! I have a voice, my family prioritizes my opinion as much as my brother's or my husband even sometimes they ask me first then my male counterpart. I don't understand which feminism is telling me to remove my scarf and baggy clothes which I am comfortable with. I'm sick of that kind of feminism which starts with showing skin ends with showing skin."
"The title of this video is misleading, as it gives the impression that you're criticizing feminism itself."
"Men and Women are already equal. It is a no.1 misconception that Womens are equal to Men only when they copy Men in everything. A Women wearing Salwar Khamez and a Men wearing T-Shirt Jeans is already equal. It is the brainwash done to Womens that you are not equal unless you also wear same clothes like Men for this they demean Salwar Khamez and show like T-Shirt Jeans is superior. But it's a misconception. Wear whatever you want until you maintain morality. On similar terms if a Men does a job and earn Money it is equal to what Women do as being a homemaker (in fact this is more responsible job to do and i think it's more important) but society brainwashes you in such a way that job where you earn Money is superior. Remember it is Mother who bring up the child provide and teach him love, care and manners. How can you consider a materialistic thing like Money is superior to what Mother can provide. I understand practically you need Money which father earns but it's not superior to anything that a Mother can provide."
In my opinion feninism is good and all but to an EXTENT to a LIMIT
"You may be right about Patriarchal and Feminism thinking. But the problem lies in the demands in implementing feminism. They do not want equal rights but the more advantages for females and to remove disadvantages. Nothing is wrong in this but only when things are done keeping in mind both genders. 

When one advantage becomes disadvantage for other gender , it cannot be called feminism, but it is happening in the name of feminism.

1. Like reservation in colleges, govt jobs, even in private jobs. It is like earlier men have taken advantages in these places now let women do. Instead of equal rights and opportunity , they want to take upperhand.
2. Like equal pay for men and women cricket teams even though they don't generate same revenue. If this logic is applied everywhere then it will disrupt the society. For example , Instagram influencers, where a girl attracts many followers by showing only curves and eventually more revenue by ads etc but boy cannot. Shouldn't the 'equal pay' logic be applied here? 
3. Like laws made to prevent cruelty on women have now became a tool to exploit innocent men. If things were done keeping both genders in mind then this would not happen. 

I can tell you innumerous examples where they have demanded upper hand instead of equality and in most cases they have been granted.
It might have helped some of the poor, needy girls or women but the number is less and the biggest beneficiary are the girls who have decent financial background or above. They have all the resources and accesses as men do but they have been granted upper hands in many places and now they exploit men same like men used to do when they had upper hand in the society. 

In nut shell , innocent men and women are still suffering. The difference is that earlier evil minded men used to exploit and now both evil minded men and women exploit according to their comfort."

I'm 18 right now and you don't even know how much things have you taught me. Not only in the field of education but how to live life happily and respect each other and all the necessary things. I recommend you highly for this generation.
The real reason people are not being feminist because in this generation people who have matriarchy mindset are spreading matriarchy named as feminist and in government too is matriarchy mindset as if a boy slaps a girl the boy in put behind the bars but if it the opposite there is no such rule for that ЁЯШотАНЁЯТиЁЯШотАНЁЯТи

Toh jab se kabir singh,animal jaise movies ka itne bde level par virodh karte hai toh fake feminism wali movies ka waise virodh kyun ni karte 
Itna hi kafi nhi hota ki support nhi kiya toh ye sahi hai.
Admiyo k liye koi jyada strict law nhi hai koi organisation nhi hai jo thodi bhout hai onki sunni nhi jati.

"The actual problem with the feminist movement is that a normal girl uneducated in this topic connects being rad and unapologetic with being a true feminist. Being disrespectful and not respecting any elder sounds consoling to their female ego.Being disrespectful is bad for anyone either a male of a female.Nowadaays in our society, its unfortunately a trend to be disrespectful and uncaring about men. When justifying this behaviour, girls say that it's their right to be disrespectful becoz somewhere in the past a man disrespected them, irrespective of the reason, so now they have the right to be rude and angry with men.This doesn't make sense. NO man I know goes out of their way to objectify women, they actually try to be extra respectful towards them.I'm not trying to justify what a male criminal has done in the past.But taking that few percentage and making it the normal for the whole male community has made the females in our day and age very intolerant.The criticizm these movies receive is not becoz they represent the true side of feminism,it's becoz they fill our female youths mind with ideas like cheating and vulgarity as being independent and right. It's really a disgrace tbh."

"Hello Mr Dhruv Rathee, I like your content as you standout for being an intellectual person with good researching skills. However, nobody is perfect. There is a movement in America known as MGTOW (Men go their own way) and they will tell you how much the modern society and law is going against men in many ways. Your views may have logic to it but your views are clearly from one side perspective as you mentioned the wrong women go through but you fail to acknowledge the hardship of men life by judging some online teenager chapris who haven't even stepped into real men life yet. I can personally give you many topics that should be discussed from a male's perspective and these are real life issues that have nothing to do with social media users or ""Alpha chapris"" like you mention. One example: Recently my American friend's parents got separated. Entire family and friends are bashing his father harshly calling him names without knowing the real issue. His kids are with the mother against his will excluding my friend who is over 18. Even for that the father gets blamed. His life is literally destroyed while the mother is happy. Many social experiments are done on double standards favoring women in society so dear Mr.. Dhruv Rathee you need to be open minded on struggles of both genders because both gender suffer in different ways."

"in simplicity a man a woman arent equal but they are equally valuable to this world, you cant expect a woman to lift 200 pounds as easily a man would, you cant expect a man to care for a child the same way a woman can, but ofc there is always exceptions, but in majority. woman and man arents the same but should be equally valued and everyone should have the right to express themselves as they please, if a woman wants to have her husbands name then good, if she doesn't then good, her choice. it goes both ways. respect both."
"The problem with modern feminism is that feminist blames everything on man rather then doing things, for example women always complain about not getting equal pay but study shows a women does 2├Ч less work then a man does and modern feminism has beacome about hating on man and matriarchy, women already have all the right idk what theyre even fighting for they now have more rights then man, feminists complain about man and women being equal even tho we are not, like women got women's stuff and man got man's stuff its just how it has Been for thousands of years feminism is pure bullshit nowdays, if its a cultural thing that letting women down theres nothing we can do thats a culture of thousands of years but as a country we should have equal rights and women say we want to get treated equally as a man in jobs but they only want jobs of high profile jobs without having any skills thats the problem and a lot of them say's we Don't need man but theyre whole life is based on man theyre living in a home build by man sound crazy, modern feminism is bullshit and pure crap"

My class topper is my friend, and you won't believe that despite being the topper, he always debates with me on feminism. Well he belongs to the countryside and according to him, women should get an education but only so much that they can teach their children that's it. He says, What is the need for women to do jobs while men are made for jobs?""
Even toppers think this way. And the sad thing is my mom also sometimes tells me, ""What do you get by always debating about girls? Patriarchy has always been dominant and you can't make everyone believe in what you think.

"In no way women are equal to men. We are different. In 2024 budget, govt is spending 3 lakh crore exclusively for women development. IIT gives reservation, dowry is banned but alimony is legal. Overall men are paying taxes to believe women are equal. In reality only less than 20% women in India are working. Men are abused financially and forced to work abroad like middle east."
"Dhruv Rathee, you blew my mind. You truly are a gem. The way you view feminism and explain it in such a simple and accessible manner is remarkable. Your insights and analogies can serve as a valuable lesson for today's youth. The comparison and discrimination between men and women that you highlighted are everyday occurrences. Yet, I've never seen anyone explain these issues as concisely and accurately as you do. Even your real life examples support the idea that patriarchy is behind most of the violence around the world. Wow !!! Your ability to distill complex gender dynamics into clear, relatable examples makes the reality of gender inequality undeniable. Your explanations not only bring awareness to these pervasive issues but also provide a foundation for meaningful discussions and change."

feminism gives you rights to choose without judgement which patriarchy doesn't ( both for men and women )
"There's no such thing as 'toxic femininity' or 'toxic masculinity'. Men and women are made as equals in the eyes of God (in terms of value), given their own areas of strengths and weaknesses, roles, and responsibilities. So, the traits of both sexes are considered divine and cannot inherently be toxic. Therefore, if a woman acts toxic, she is not feminine, and if a man acts toxic, he is not masculine.

(Though I may not be a perfect human, I try to live my life in accordance with my beliefs. My opinions may differ from yours, but that does not give me the right to condemn you, nor does it give you the right to condemn me.)"

"Did he say that a sensible guy would always be a feminist?? Trust me , that's the worst a man can become. Every man should be a good guy and every girl should be a good girl regardless. If guys can't differentiate between being a man or a psycopathic animal then thats not people's lookout, but his personal decision and he will have to pay for it. I am in no way supporting animal movie, i havent even watched a movie but dhruv is definitely not right about feminism...and guys like him should never be the role model of other guys who can't even understand the female nature. Dhruv wants to be liked so bad that its a joke at this point. Feminists are the worst of woman. And not even a woman should be feminist. Feminists are peole who wants to say politically correct things but they also demand equality on outcomes as well. Follow the videos of american youtubers as well if you know english guys. You'll learn a lot about the worst outcomes of feminism and how its the very reason of destruction of their societies. Dhruv rathee is definitely not a trustworthy guy just cuz he talks about ram and all these mythical gods. They were good people, he is not them remember that...learn yourself about things and stop taking shortcuts on learning things from a guy you dont know..."

bdeshi nokkar (because he never says anything agents american left wing political beliefs. he wants left wing india so us can control india through gayism and femanism. which slowly helps women harass the common man so no man with an political ambition can climb the ladder or inshort femanism is a powerful tool to criticize who have power and shun them if they don't follow the political femanist belief because if they do they will be docile to them and if they don't they know that these type of people are their enemy)

No feminist supported that Lucknow girl? Yes some self proclaimed feminists showed their support to that Lucknow girl. That's the only factually incorrect statement found in this video.
Meko kuch v point legit nhi lgam... Equality alag topic hai aur comparison between gender alag ..... Mard aur aurat kv v equal ho hi nhi skte .... Kyunki ik mard ghar ka takat hota hai to ik aurat ghar ki emotions ... Dono ik point nhi hai but dono ik hi line k end hain ..... Ladki aur ladka totally different Kyunki dono ki parvarish alag hoti hai .
Agar feminism ka naam kuchh aur hota toh kya log zada support krte?

I do agree that all females does not have equal rights and this is something which we can fix. But thinking men and women are equal and women can do all things that man can is totally bullshit.

"Dhruv, sir 
I was in 9th or 10th stnd when I watched one of your videos through a whatsapp forward and I was super impressed with your intellect and kinda shocked to know that guys like you actually exist in real life. It's because I grew up in a tier 2 city and the environment here was patriarchal and sexist. Ngl I even took a ss of your photo to cheer me up whenever I lost hope in the entire male population. 
Now, at 21, after watching this video I'm so glad that humanity isn't dead afterall and there still are actual men like you who do not view women like how patriarchy views and treats them. 
I really hope this video reaches a large audience because I think feminism is the most mis-represented social movement of all times and therefore myths around it needs to be busted. 
Also, many congratulations to you (saw the news that you're having a baby) and all the best for everything... you're doing an excellent job in creating a social change and spreading awareness about many issues. Thank you so much.

"Dear Dhruv Rathe,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to you because we are in desperate need of your help.

Recently, students at our universities (Specially Dhaka University, Chittagong University and Jahangir Nagar University) has been subjected to severe torture and harassment by government officials and student political league named ""CHHATRA LEAGUE"". 

This situation has created an atmosphere of fear and oppression, and many of us feel powerless to change it.

We're in an authoritarian regime.

We believe that your platform could bring much-needed attention to our plight. We need strong international media coverage.

It's not limited in ""quota protest"" anymore. It's much more than that. 

We may regain our freedom of speech.

Your influence and ability to reach millions could help expose these atrocities and potentially bring about change. We kindly ask if you could make a video or post about our situation to shed light on what is happening here.

It's 4:15 am. And I can't sleep thinking about my brothers and sisters of Jahangir Nagar University.

I myself also was attacked by the ""CHHATRA LEAGUE"" yesterday at 3pm when doing a peaceful protest.
Many was injured. I escaped somehow.

I love my country. I'm not feeling safe in my own homeland.

We would be incredibly grateful if you could use your platform to help us. Your support could make a significant difference in our fight for justice and safety. People of Bangladesh are fade up with this fascist government culture.

Thank you for considering our request. Please let us know if you need any further information or if there are other ways we can assist you in covering this issue.

Sincerely,

A Bangladeshi Student from University of Chittagong."

But what ppl think it to be is giving advantage to women. I find this stereotype to be a major reason why ppl dont support feminism.

"Great video. Thanks for this. You skipped a lot of great work done by women in the 1920s- 60s, not only by white upper class western feminist but also by Indian feminist. Hansa Mehta played an important role in shaping the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by changing the first line from тАШAll men are born free and equal in dignity and rightsтАЩ to тАШ All human beings are born тАжтАЩ. There are so many such stellar women in our country in that period who have played important part in the long feminist movement. It is because of them  that today we have a better life today but still a long long way to go. Also just wanted to point out, when you were talking about anatomical differences, you said gender instead of sex. You should have touched upon the difference between these two. Gender is a social construct but maybe you could make another video on just this, which would be highly controversial with your audience if you go into the fluidity of gender. Educating your audience in small doses perhaps."

Surah An-Nisa (4:124): ""Whoever does righteousness, male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely let him live a good life, and We will surely give them their reward for the best of what they used to do.""  These verses emphasizes that both men and women are judged based on their actions and faith, not gender."

"Toxic feminism is not equal to feminism. But Toxic feminism = Extreme patriarchy. Patriarchy and feminism are not bad for the society, one will teach discipline and one will teach love. However toxic feminists are cancerous to society and it is no less than another new face of extreme patriarchy.  There is a clear difference between women empowerment and SIMPing. If a 21year old woman in relationship with 15 year old boy and still 15 year old kid will be pointed if she files rape even though she attracts with pocso and all these because how regressive low level society India got. Read statistics about fake rape cases, using marriage to extort alimony, how dowry laws being used as a tool to extort money, men suicides, parental alienation. Last part of the video. Lucknow girl she harassed that guy. Is she now in jail or served jail time? I guess not. And you are mixing up feminist and toxic feminists both together when referring to that's totally wrong.

I need feminism because in most of the cartoons main characters are male which has an effect on a female children's mind that she can't be the main character in her life.

I need feminism because there are also so many places on earth where female zygotes are killed cause it's a female. 

I need feminism because a 12 year old girl gets SeXUALIZED with eyes and behaviors and then she gets blamed. 

I need feminism because  getting catcalled is still a thing. 

I need feminism because a man comes home for cooked food meanwhile a woman comes home from job to cook the food.

Vaise to feminist ka ye topic apne uthaya hi nahi ki feminism matlab equality ke liye ladne wala to fir vo male  rights ke liye q nahi ladti and women privileges hi chalu hai aur fir vo bhi equality nahi hoti
"Women have more attractive physics than men , that's why  a man can go out  in the shorts and nobody will be attracted  and distracted by him,  nobody will see him eagerly.  Equally  means having  equal  good and authentic rights , regulations, and opportunities, not illegal right  eg : homosexual ,  transgender , short dresses , alcohol and physical relationship even ,  it's llegal by the government,   but it's not convenient and the result of it destroyed the society where our children are growing up. Illegal rights are taken by pressure on the government. 
In my religion, a woman can be chief justice ( judge) , but  can't apply for president  ( prime Minister)  but she can give  advice,  suggestions, and recommendations. If  she becomes a president then she will be  highlighted in front of  all the world and people only will notice her appearance , charm , youngest and voice . The president qualities are strong voice and strong physics to maintain a discipline and give strong warning to the world for protecting his country. 
 Women are not physically sronger than men,  that's why a man can do hard work for finances but a woman can do only slightly work. That's why men have to take responsibility for family members. 
Women considered as a old at  the age of 50 and she has menopause (   can't be pregnant)  but the actual timing is not confirmed by medical.  Some women have menstruation after age of 60 . Many films actresses got married after age of 45 and got pregnant after age of 55 . Actresses also fauj ( hiding real age) their age for 10 years because it's a showbiz careers requirement.  Women can be pregnant after perimenopause by hormonal treatment but men can not produce sperm after age of 60 even a man got married at the age of 50 and from 50 to 60 age he  is  able to produce sperm but his children will not be normal and healthy. Surely his children will be disabled ,  abnormal even can't be survived longer. Women ( plus 55 age) can birth normal and healthy babies but  babies from men ( plus 55 age ) can not be normal and healthy. Always women considered   younger than men at marriage time at least 10 , 18 years age difference  not same age. 
Mostly girls been forced to get  married at the age of 18. It's mean women have expiry date of age but men have no expiry date. 
Every man thinks that he can have many wives at same time but this rule  had been allowed only to the PROPHETS for supporting  the helpless women ,not  for every men. Nowadays  , you can support to the helpless women by charity. 
In Colombia , China ,  Croatia,  Austria,  Turkey,   Russia and Cuba , women are retired earlier than men.
18 years age of boy can lose his man 's  strength , power and  problems of  penis shrinkage and fracture  due to any causes  ,mostly  due to  bad activities and  it has no recovery  treatments  ,but women  can never have these problems even she involves in bad activities or not 
In my religion women can be alive by own without marriage. Just follow the religion. 
In many countries  women being forced to  get married to the animals and having diffenciation between girls and boys .Abortion with baby girl and having pills to change gender in the  ovary is common. 
A woman can learn,  work and  protect her self. 
In this world  bad men and women always exists between good men and women to destroy them. 0:01"

"The most important similarity between a man and a woman is that they both have brain, the organ responsible for intelligence, emotions, cognition, memory, learning, decision making, logic & reasoning etc etc,  so why should men and women be treated differently for matters related to the brain???? What is the logic behind it?? Anyone with a little bit of common sense will understand something as simple as this..... Its just that for years men have been brainwashed into believing that women are less intelligent than men..... So when they see a woman who is more intelligent and more capable than a man in any field of life men try to oppress that woman to save themselves from embarrassment.... But that doesn't hide the fact there always will be a group of women who will always be more intelligent, more capable,  have more sharpness and more potential  to be successful than men."

"It's pretty straightforward, if a human wants to be something or wants to do something within the limits of permissible laws of the nation. He/She should be Independently able to do so...... But furthermore we need to understand, success doesn't have to be gender specific. Just because a man, good in his political/corporate/ any other career is considered as a Successful Man, A woman doesn't have to do the same just for the sake of portraying herself as a Successful Woman.

A woman/man should pursue what suits them best and be successful in that.

It has become very common now that women are trying to be successful as men. If they really wanna do something, it's fantastic. But just for the sake of proving it to the society that you can do the same thing that men can do, if you chase it you've clearly lost it.

A Woman or a Man are not entirely the same, nature has much more intelligence than we do. It made a difference between them to fulfill different purposes.

A woman on one hand has various abilities in which she is far superior to men, and the same goes for men as well.

Where is the question of equality here, it's like saying Apple wants to be equal to Orange, No god no, they are not and never can be and never should be, otherwise either you have 2 Apples or 2 Oranges. What about diversity then.....

Nature has made diverse, unique and different human beings. Nature didn't divide them, There has to be a coherence in them. 

If anyone tries to be superior or even equal to each other, they're doomed to fall sooner or later."

Our country needs more people like you who have this much clarity on feminism even I also didn't know this much
"i disagree with feminism regardless of its claims on equality. as I have noticed , it is more of man vs woman power struggle within societies. I have seen women take advantage of their freedom in western societies through family laws and property rights. They use the women rights and feminist ideologies to defend their unfair acts. I realise there can not be a society where men or women can have equal right. Reasons are:  for thousands of years most societies lived under male domination. And I agree that male took advantage of his dominance. Similarly if women were in charge of societies , They would do the same cruelty to men as men did to women. So in terms of morality men and women can be both ignorant , either of them can do injustice to each other if given opportunity. here is always competition between these 2 genders by nature somehow. Those who are married they can see this in their relationship. There is always power struggle between 2 genders. Therefore even set laws for equality , either gender will struggle to abuse those freedom and laws try to stay dominant in every matter. 
Based on their biological physical differences , it really matters in their capabilities. This is true, For example , My own elder sister was complaining that she is is unable to find job online in Australia. I was shocked. So I tried make her resume, and tried job hunting for her on my laptop. I saw most of the jobs were physically heavy work that a women can not handle them, and advertisements were asking for stronger men in order to avoid problem such as back injuries , safety issues. And there were very limited positions where jobs were available such as admin roles. Most were demanding a female for the role, some were flexible and asking for either gender. but the pay was less, not because they were asking for female but because the work was very easy. 
Say a man gets employed he would get the same pay rate as if they would employ a women. I realise that in most factories they demand for men because their physical capabilities, not because they were discriminating against women. I knew those job are not for my sister, she can not lift upto 20 kg being single or after marriage on pregnancy. Therefore the physical capability is natural fact that can not be denied. You can not compare a cat with fish and expect both to climb tree. but yes a cat has it own ability and fish has it is own importance to make this world perfect. it does not mean that one is superior upon another. This is the point where feminism has failed to understand and it is unnatural ideology."
"thank you Dhruv for changing my perspective. I didn't even know that I had that patriarchy mindset, you explained it with such a simplified manner and honestly, it was an eye opener."
"Both gender must respect eachother,  Rights should also be given to womens. But the difference exist between both genders. The nature had made some differences between both genders. There is a hell of difference between rights of male and female. If you say both should be consider equally so its not possible . Let me explain :

1) Cricket Team of male and female is different. Why in cricket team both genders are not included ? Why There is no match between Maleb and female teams?

2) why girls and boys have different hostels?

3) why seperate washroom are made for them?

4) why we cant see Male vs Female sports?

5) why Males are in large number in Army? 

6) why male and female doesnot have equal strength?

7) If all females do work in offices , hospitals, markets etc. Who will care about childrens.?? Who will Teach children's to be best.?

8) if we consider equal rights : there will be instability in a family even between husband and wife.

9) if we consider both are equal so there will no stability between them.

For example: If a boss in a company or else where pass an order . You have to obey it but if you think that i am equal to boss so you will be expelled. 

10) females moslty say that they are independent. My question is how? If a female does not live with her husband she think that she is independent. But think over the reality that she will do some sort of job? And ultimately she will be employed. Here in this case she is again not independent because she have to obey the orders of boss.


In conclusion, i do not think that females should not given rights ...but both genders have different rights and both should be given their own rights according to nature.

"Exactly...nowadays even me and my sister facing problems bcoz of some women's patriarchal thinking... So the incident was some people in my colony meeting where we live were misbehaving with my father on a specific topic, just bcoz majority of them were from same caste so they argue with my father in groupism. No one listening my father's opinion instead started trying to insult my father. So me and my elder sister started speaking in support of my father. So everyone was telling us that "" u r girls, n girls should not speak in public. U girls r shameless, ur upbringing is wrong, our daughters n even daughter-in-laws don't speak in front of others"" and most of words like this came from women. Why we should not talk? why we should not take stand for our parents? Just bcoz we r girls.. this is really sad n wrong"
we dont make rules but nature did AS nature men is head of his women you are right is someway but not inall ways brother still you are so far from reality feek bad for you

"Thank you so much Dhruv Rathi Sir for this amazing video. I'm so touched that I'm on the verge to cry. I really needed this. Each and every word you've said, is so damn true! 

 I'm a high school students, studying in a residential school. Here, the condition is worse. Wish I could preach them all and show this video to my juniors, fellow classmates and teachers specially. 

But no worries. Thanks to your videos and my determination, I'll definitely bring a  change to my society."

"I am sorry, I disagree with this point. In my college days I was very rational and used to be  an extreme feminist, but after watching the women closely I came to know that they are very selfish and egocentric. Two of the girls whom I loved with all my heart and soul, specially to the second one, cheated on me very badly, that too for no reason, by no reason, I mean, I didn't give them any reason to cheat on me whether financial or anything else like that, but they cheated on me, apologized to me, I forgave them. they again cheated on me,  again apologized to me, I again forget them. they again cheated on me,   ..  this is what women are"

"My views is,  if a man are not strong, families and societies become weak. But in opportunities and talent both have equal rights. Good Man are made to protect families, country boundaries, whereas household responsibilities are by good women. Bad human beings can be both. If a man rap women or if a girl rap man, or put a false rap cases, bad are these both. But somehow, i observe most present societies, women are in much cares and love than the man like evn in a false rap cases, man are torture and blame in the name of protection, but for man rights none stand up except Mother, evn if a man are right in the street still bt girls can slap or put any cases without evidence n man will be punish, if not comes with strong evidence. Both should be given equal rights. Think if most politicians, police, armies fighting in boundaries, freedom fighters, are women, apart from other professionals work, what will be the society condition. I feel i am made to protect and provide necessities, and to bring protection in my house, if future wife is good, and to my country. God had gievn own strength and talent to both if they are both equal in everything than in society, why rich Girl don't get married  with poor boys and provide securities to families, to which good and responsible man do. Both girls and boys should be uplift and encourage, bt to some certain levels. I take man who really rap woman, or destroyed others are not man bt a mad man of devil."

Some women uses or weponise Feminism to attack on males who just do their job and exist. There is a area in feminism to that exist to oppress or suppress innocent male rights.
"My boyfriend is on the line between this discussion. He respects me,his mom and every woman he comes across, supports me and his mom in working (literally makes future plans on the basis that I'll be earning more than him) and he's happy. But GOD FORBIDS its about him. He is so so so helplessly patriachal, I can't cry , I can't show u my weakness, whatever is hurting me will go away I should not express it I'm a man. Im trying my best to help him.I want him to support himself just as much he supports me. Let's see if my psychology honours will help me."
Go back to your country. And criticise them
It's incredibly enlightening.
"I am all for equality, across all borders, including gender. As for wages, it should be based on outcomes. However, equality cannot transcend the biological differences between men and women. Its simply unreasonable, in other words it going against nature.  You cannot expect a fish to grow feathers and fly, and expect a bird to procreate by laying billions of eggs. Law of nature brings order, and going against it will only create chaos."
Ye kya bolri ho rinki ki ammaЁЯШЕ
Good one. But how broad minded r ppl in india? After marriage why should only a girl leave her house and her parents where she was born nd brought up and go to totally new unknown family and adjust for everything? Why should only girls change their surname after their marriage? If it is a inter- religious marriage why should all the rivaz be done as per the guys religion nd why should the girl follow only husband's religion and convert into that? Why do children get only fathers surname? Fathers religion? Why not mothers infact mother is the one who gave birth to them? I am proud to be born as a girl but regret to be born as a girl in INDIA

"A woman cannot be equal. It is not a matter of fact that a man wants to take women out of their homes and get them out of work
 Then the house also wants to put its responsibility on women. The slogan is blond that it is women's rights and all the arguments that are given were given. Now is a woman who has to have a child, then there is no such thing as an example of this child. It is not possible to get home
May this child be promoted. He also does housework while the man only works. It is natural. The man is strong. He is also responsible. However, many things are in it. It is his right to get education. He does not have to be equal to the man and the example of the difference between the intelligent and arrogant people of men. This example is so weak
 Which fool has said is the same status of a wise man's opinion which is a fool's opinion from today, not in Greece, Socrates died because of this ideology, but the thing is, it is difficult to admit the truth"

"Women can never be the same as men. And their rights can not be the same! In some cases, women get more facilities than men which a man never gets. Giving equal rights is a very bad choice not for the men but for the women. Thats why some women never support this equal rights' illusion."

12:33 Women and men are made differently . Its shameful that I hear such remarks from an intelligent person like you.
"12:25 Hypergamy is naturally in women. Don't try to change the nature of women because if you do , they will break."
"Feminist societies don't necessarily solve the isolation problems of men but could aggravate them as feminism is slowly taken over by radical feminism. Notice America or some of the European cultures as examples, highly feminist cultures today.  Studies show many men there are more isolated, lack touch, emotionally repressed and have more depression issues than a country like India which is wrong in being patriarchal but has more male solidarity and friendships than those nations. I cannot totally agree with this idea that feminist societies also become more pro manly. Empirical evidence of western nations seems to show that the system in west is not becoming gender equal but more highly gynocentric for various reasons and seems to be ignoring men's issues. I maybe not totally right about this, but studies do show western men having more toxic issues than Asian men.
I am not saying this as I am anti west or a nationalist Indian, but simply based on actual studies of feminist west. I am not also alpha male.  I would be happy to be proved wrong."
"12:44 nahi vai, yea bohoti galat soch hay. agar wo admi tumhe nahi janta aur tumhe for no reason gali de de, tab offence mat lena. Lekin jab to tumhara gadi me scratch kar dia to tab to offence lena padega na! tab to usse paisa usul karna padega na.
lekin aisa trick apne jan pahachan ke logoke samne mat karna. log tumhe lallu samjhenga (personal experience) aur log tumhe for no reason aur v zada gali denge, eventually wo bulling me convert ho jayega. kyu ki tum huch nahi karte.

"Sir, the problem with modern day feminists is that they don't want to abolish the patriarchy, they want to make a matriarchy, like a large proportion of them start campaigns on roads with slogans like kill all men, or men are trash, or a woman will always be superior to a man and stuff like that. Plus many of these modern day feminists, mostly use the social media as a weapon, by making fake videos on men, who don't even talk to them or have just glanced at them and start calling them names like creeps, or these a guys are future rapists and stuff like that, my point being the so called feminists of the modern generation, don't want equal rights all they want is superiority. Please give your opinions on this"

"The real problem i find in what is known as ""modern feminism"" is that women thinking that they don't need men. Infact we need both of them and we need each other in every aspects of our life. The idea that spreading now that women can be equal to men is totally wrong in my view. Women and men are different, both in anatomy and also in several other aspects. But just like dhruv rathee bro said, it doesn't mean they don't need equal rights. We are similar, which is enough to have equal rights. But the problem still lies on many people's mind and I've seen many videos of people saying that 'we don't need men/ we don't need women', then saying that this is feminism. The real feminism is not only about women, but about both men and women."
"Excellent.

In this sh*t gen, both men and women are becoming toxic day by day. So, respect men and women, both who deserves it. Don't be a feminist who start supporting what girls do which is influencing people in a very wrong way. That's not called feminism, that's simping."

"Far spectrum of any ideology is dangerous whether it is Feminism or Patriarchy. 
In my opinion, Gender Equality is impossible to achieve as long as women are hypergamous. Today, Women enjoys even more legal right than men in most countries. But still, THey are falling behind.

Men believes more in action to improve situation than expressing emotions. Women give more suicide threats than men but men commit suicide more. By nature, Men are more action oriented."
Your information act as tonic for mind.. Eye opener.. Lot of things to work upon.. Start with me from today after watching it.. I m feminists still lot of things more to implement..
"Maturity is when you realize that women and men arenтАЩt created to be equal but have their own advantage and disadvantage. And trying to make them both equal will create unequality for a significant amount men such as higher divorce rate, getting life partner will become very hard for lower income men, marriage will become harder, families will get broken more, lower birth rate, more depression among women and loneliness among men and harder time for a man to get employed cause women have already captured lots of jobs. And men will be expected to make more money as majority women wants a man who earns more than her and unemployed men will be invisible in society and hard time getting job and they will not have families cause they are unemployed but on the other hand unemployed women will easily find life partner. Men will be afraid of marriage because of law and family system will be totally broken with lots of single mom and unmarried old women. Feminism only favors capitalism and industry owners and governments as they get cheap labour but the normal people suffer without even realizing the problem and women get deluded by thinking feminism will make them happy and successful and instead of cooking for their husband and raising children they work in office and earn money then come home and cook for themself and for their husband and children if married. But now they are more independent and salary is lower cause more people in work field and higher inflation hence more people are working more and earnibg less while the people in top are making more."

"In our society, there are many pseudo feminists, who wishes of Matriarchy. The problem with feminism is that other feminists who back for equal rights of men and women, doesn't stand against those matriarchal women. Feminists would easily attack patriarchy which is needed, but never does address the evils of matriarchal women. These matriarchal women remains under the shadow of feminism, and accuse guys of being misogynist, when they themselves are misandrists. These misandrists have the idea that men after exploiting women for generations do not have the right to stand for the women, be feminists themselves, as men cannot understand the issues of women, that women are doomed by God itself, when God chose to be patriarchal and had hence sent women as baby bearers. General people doesn't have a proper understanding of what feminism is, and that's a big failure of Feminism as per now, the failure included in the the arrogance and hatred of patriarchal men, that THERE IS NO TOXIC FEMINISM, BUT MATRIARCHAL TENDENCIES WHERE WOMEN BEING MISANDRISTS CHOOSE TO EXPLOIT THE PERKS OF FEMINISM LIKE HOW FOR AGES MEN HAD EXPLOITED WOMEN UNDER PATRIARCHY. 

Happy Equal Rights. Pat Pat exploited women and men in these evil society."

Equal right means same right of consumption of every thing excluding few. For example few works are totally for men and few are women. Just like leadership, few jobs. women harassments are increase for your so much calling feminism. The first woman leadership was introduce in roman empire in the life time of Prophet Muhammad  (peace be upon him). His words are like this ""A nation in a woman can't prosper."" God sent all the prophet as his leader as men not in women. Can you explain it why?

During marriage, a woman can easily fu$k off with half of her husband's net worth without an issue with just a little piece of paper. There are NO laws to defend men against such acts. If a man cheats? Boom, she gets everything. If a woman cheats well, she gets everything here TOO! Now, some people will think I'm a women hater or think that all the problems stem from giving women rights. Both are false. The real problem is movement from conservativism or traditionalism towards a hollow meaningless world made up of fake promises for what?! MOrDeNiSm?????

"ok so i have a slightly diffrent opinion as a male myslef i think its our responsibility to provide and protect our family see this is a universal truth that a most of 18yo boys are stronger than a 30yo women so i think if there is a fight to happen the boy should protect his sister mother etc or women idk whoever she is or a stranger then the next thing is that in the hirarchy of society womens should get the right to vote but there is a diffrence in the opinion of giving them strong positions they shouldnt be given any strong position like a militry general unitll or unless they are exceptional becuase this is a genral fact that men are more strong emotionally as compared to women so the deicision making power of men is more harsh and stronger than a women under immense pressure its jst not simple not possibel and we all know that for sure whenever u go back in history and look at the great wars they were fought by men and that is the primal rule men are supirior in physical and emotional capability i dont think there is a women out there strong enough to be a military general fighting against the mongoles and tatar around 1000ce who decapitate u and hang ur skull on their waists as a reminder of that they killed u or eating raw flesh and heart of animals and drinking blood or jst slicing the bellies of pregnant womens and killing their child alongside them and hanging their skulls side by side or decapitating every men in the city in a line after counquring the city  womens are simpley not built for such gore and violence women cant possibaly lead an army under such circumstances and more over they are weak physically where ever u go go on the internet and search most of the physical records are made by men and womens tend to weaken under such circumstances aaah u can say some exceptional cases like their are some weak men and strong womens but see the majority so leader hip should be directly under men that is my opinion ofc u can have ur own but i stated my arguments now the third thing is that i think womens should be given equal rights in every field of works in pay checks in protection in medical i think more than men cuz they need it more if there is a single mother working 9 to 5 for her 4 childrens its difficult for her mentally and physically and i think they shuold be given more bonuses and more pay checks if a men is being paid 500$ for that job the women should be pain 700$ that is becuzse the nature as made diversity but diversity sure creates inequality not in the norms that sure is created by the society but in physical and mental circumstances and i am not agsint womens going in military they can go as doctors they can go as teachers they can go in other profetions like the one in controle room etc but in war u should send men it isnt wise to send womens in war aaah yess u need to have womens for arresting womens and etc in police they should be there ofc a male shoulndt like arrest a women ofc they are mroe harsh and u know more strict womens should deal with that so see there are many factors see nature created men and women two seperate genders now the thing is nature created diversity but also inequality in abilites see men cant reproduce but sure are strong and womens can reproduce but are weak so the thing is that resources should be distributed over need not norms but i think that should be also undercontrole as per laws obvioulsy there will be very much exploitation wich is inevitable so there should be laws and they should be imposed and followed so but the point is i do think womens should be given more as men are supirior i don say in a racial and creational way like racist people say white poeple are supirior then black but in a way like men are suprior as per the creation the nature has given them more physical and mental strenght and that is the truth men have been providing hunting and creating socities and increasing their political influences ctreating wars for thousand of years till now and women have been doing household work for thousands of years and that is the general rule of thumb but as the society advances i think the normas shuold mature and should change a little bit as the faminits normally potray masculinity as a dangrous thing but it is the polar opposite genuine and true masculinity is ouit there to protect to provide next thing is that womens should be given any job they want pilots engineer doctor but i here i do think there should be optimal rules for hijab and letting women cover themselves cuz this is the basic thing and even scientific studies provide evidence3s that men tend to be more visuallly please as compared to women there has beeen several studies that 50% or more of men at work watch porn or masterbuate and do other secuall activites and many places are involved in such office cultures there has been more studies on office affairs and u can yourself see air hostesses only womens who suffice some specific beauty norms in many airlines are taken in as air hostesses the question is why because society objectifies women bucuase they want their men audience pessanger to be more pleaseed see this is truh and no one can deny that so jobs like that i dont think are safe and hounerrable and i also don entirely oppose the idea of womens being piloets or being airhostesses they can be but in womens portion so some changes thousld be made and for gods sake understand that the society says the less clothes u have the more revealed u are the more educated and liberall and opne minded u are but that isnt the case the thing is all of them want to see u in tight and rvealing clothes why should we not do hijab its safe aaaah u can argue but i do have more arguments then this and many more so the thing is i am not entirely against the idea of letting womens do jobs but i am against the culture and envirnment of jobs its ok for a grl to be an engineer its totally fine its ok but the job environement should be more promissing and more  protecting see many grls are harrassed in offices and work spaces by the culture there their are many and i think lots of videos on social media circulating u can see them urselvs of grls getting touched at inappropirate places and etc why beacuse of the office job culture the places are clingy and cramped up with 50 to 60 popels in a single hall so the environment womens should be treated with due respect and with due kindness and i also think womens should aloso become doctors then how will childrens be born and etc other prognancy and women stuff issues etc u get the point so there isnt a black and white war between faminists and patriaarchal pople its more of a gray area in between so do adress every iddue i think ithis topic should be adressed more and more poroperly ok so let me know ur thoughts on this topic btw i am only teeling u my pov not saying that u should absolutly folow this but do consider these points too dont become a blind eye to these topics obv u dont want ur siter ur mother ur wife to be harrsses and ain any type of rape case f harrassment case u will prbaby kill that guy if u knew that was hapening at that moment or u wont want ur doughter to be in a illicit relation with a narcissit guy who jst want to dat her for the body and dont want t marry her and give her her rights and jst run away after sex and after imporegnannting and leaving her with life trauma and guilt and i think u are also aware of society so she wont get marries or have proper relatin with another guy after that i think u know it more and understnad this too her see u get the point .

You did not even speak about equality vs equity and wrongful reservation given to non deserving women killing meritocracy.
"24:42  ladki ko freely ghumne do to apne aap ko asman ka sitara samjhne lgenge, aur admi ko freely ghumne diye jaye fir v vo apne aap ko jamin par hi mahsoos krenge."
"11:28 that's the difference between men and women, so if someone wants 100% equality for men and women then, it's wrong.

we can't give 100 percentage equality for both gender,

for example in buses there are reserved seat for women but not for men, why? where's the equality.

men and women are different, and should be given different preference and not equal preference and opportunities."

But problem for them is also that they don't get any support in society from anyone. It is a long fight. Majority of Indian movies show the drooling males. Most stories start from ogling and making life difficult   for college, work going females. So, you are certainly doing a great job."

The real world is far from the ideal world he describes. In the real world feminist ideology means freedom from men.

"One of my school teacher used to tell us that every girl should be financially independent. Lest, the girl who is not financially independent, can't give any statement in any kind of issue.She won't get any respect in family. But, I think that she should tell us every people should be financially independent. Lest,both male and female, won't get any respect in family or society. In this era,this is the ultimate truth.But, some so called feminists like to talk about faminism by using the hate words about male.Actually, they don't know the real meaning of faminism.Sometimes, they think that they are talking about women's rights and respect but they don't.They insult the women more by doing gender discrimination in their own way."

"Patriarchy and pseudo feminism are secretly in love with each other. Just as a racist man loves to talk about another race for its backward mentality, so that the race is insulted , but he does nothing to remove their backwardness,... alpha males love to talk about pseudo feminists but call them feminists so that they can tarnish real feminism. Fake feminists love to use patriarchy as an excuse to bully ,not the alpha males, but the men who really respect women. The love of patriarchy for pseudo feminism and vice versa is because..... they both are thirsty for power, by crushing social equality. The victims are the innocent men and women, at whom society always puts the blame."

"@Dhruv youтАЩve answered your own question.  What is being portrayed and used as feminism today is not the original and real feminism.  However, this is what it is today.  And this feminism is what people dislike.  The 2nd thing is, when you have rights you have to act sensibly and rationally, not emotionally.  Sadly many women use emotions to make decisions.  Then people wonder what was the point of having rights if you mess up that privilege."

In today's world a most common disease which is prevailing in our society leading to different crimes is so called extramarital affairs so if a woman knows that a man is married then why the hell she couldn't stop him to make relationship with her n save other woman's dignity who is wife of that stupid man but no she would encourage a man only to leave her jabki pata hai ki wo aadmi tujhko bhi dhokha hi dega baad mein kyunki uski fitrat mein hai wo toh stop toh humko hi karna padega na ...i know exceptions r always there but then u mutually get seperate with respect why the hell u ditching ur married partner n here woman plays imp role in both scenarios..we should stop playing victimized on very first instance
I think you are impacted. I am not in side of patriarchy but I am not in the side of feminism also. I will prioritize giving proper right according to ones qualification. Do whatever you want to do but rising or increasing social problem will not be accepted. But if you observe to the deep of our society you will found there's a lot of insect around us who are belonging from both gender and they are breaking our social norms which are count as welfare customs. They want something really different from welfare customs. They are ill minded and they never think the impact of their behavior on our society.
That's the reason woman opsite of women right they said we have more enough Rights ЁЯШвЁЯШв
Dhruv bhai ... U r very much right n totally justifiable but being a woman I must add that in mostly cases mainly in our country a woman is suffered by another woman only bcoz we r the first one who doesn't respect another woman n mostly do their character assassin..in a traditional family a woman is a victim of another woman's torture whether it's in any role so first of all we should learn to respect the another woman n take a stand if anything going wrong with them in a particular family or society bcoz we r the first one who blames a woman only if anything happens wrong with them...women r always more stronger n superior than men since ages so why they want to be equal to men n pull themselves behind ЁЯШВЁЯШВ n if it's so then why seats reserved for women they should also commute standing as they r equal...its all a typical mindset
Politics was enough Dhruv. This topic is highly debatable considering the stupidity feminism has led the world into
"15:37  I differ from dhruv, I don't know which data he is giving but I personally saw that men are more open minded they don't afraid  to be mocked rather  our female freinds have a sense of insecurity even more among their female freinds. 

Men and women though are same species but their biology is completed different,sorry to say men are more aggressive though they shouldn't whereas women are normally kind hearted biologically. 
Jaise sc or St ko agar equality dena chahte Hain to unko reservation se o equality ata hain ap to tab nehi bolte e koi alag species Hain kya inko reservation milta hain.
The term equality has vast implications.
And please answer why women reservation is being given if we all are same.

Sad reality is that women are the worst enemy of women.
It is truly said that women are the only enemies of the other women
"At the end of the day, Men and Women have equal rights but not equal responsibilities.  Everyone speaks about their rights, but not duties. Men have an exponentially greater duty than women that is to protect and provide for women. If you understand that, you will know that even it's a disgrace if all jobs that Men are supposed to take up are already taken up by women because their male boss loves to hire them instead.. what will you make of this ? How do you expect Men to lead the family like a king if this is the situation in the society ? Yes Men are always the culprits behind many evil motives, it's just that women are falling victim to their evil motives as well. At the end of the day these so called bullshit feminists are serving none other than these evil men in their attempt to tag themselves superior or equal. Don't fall for men. Instead make them responsible for you. Make them work hard to be a real macho, who can provide for you and protect you. What if Sharukh khan's Wife Gauri khan said she wants to be the super star and kicked him out of his roles and came to the fore front ? Bizarre right ? SRK will be SRK only if he found peace and support back at home. And he will be remembered as a great man as long as he provides and takes good care of his family including the women around him, his sister, his wife, his daughter. And that's why people like SRK, CR7, Messi are all respected, not because they are amazing talents, because they dress up and act like Men. That's what a real Man is supposed to be. Not just sacrifice his power for his family, but the society as a whole. That's why Bhagat Singh is revered as well. Let women allow men to lead, but make sure the man you chose is worthy of being a true leader. That's it, problem solved..So get educated first. Don't follow Bollywood fantasies. Education is must for all, there's no gender priority."

"Hi Dhruv ! 
I had this in mind since a long time but wasnтАЩt sure if i should say it. 
After months of watching your videos , i feel like i can . 
I really wish that you make a video on female hormones , changes in female body , menstruation , menopause , pregnancy, child birth , postpartum  and various other painful cycles that a woman goes through. I think our society needs awareness on this subject and coming from you would mean a lot .

Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us тЩ╛я╕П keep it coming star"

How men too suffer under patriarchy was very beautifully brought out. About women's voting rights, I was stunned to note that there were indeed women who were against women's voting rights.
You could have added that some countries which are projected as great , like Switzerland for instance, gave voting rights to women very late , in the late sixties, I think, and that too after years of protests.

when a man is accussed of fake rape.. he is guilty till  proven innocent.. even he is proved that he is innocent .. the bad mark in his life remains..i am shocked DHRUV RATHEE overlooked this ... like this there a lot of problems for men .. but he is a man he will face it like a man right?? from the beginning of earth till now .. there was no matriarchal system in world ..and if it happens nothing cchanges for man . the hard jobs will must be done by men .. women are not capable of it ... these feminist will never volunteer for these jobs ... anyway at the end no will see mens suffering .. it will be overlooked all the time.."

4. In many job appointments boys are seriously discriminated against and same there about promotions.

I absolutely agree the fact that men should be allowed to show emotion. But my opinion is both men and women should be emotionally strong. Plus current feminism is just equality where women geet privilege. Like how there are laws that protect women. Some women exploit these laws. The man's life is destroyed if she accusses him of sexual assault. But otherwise I agree with your points

"This video is filled with logical fallacies specially quoting from famous people. Information is vastly available but also ignorant is at its peak. In todayтАЩs world feminism has become demonising men and showing ungratefulness what men has done for women. Statistically, todayтАЩs infrastructure is still run by men and women are least interested to take jobs such as cleaning sewage systems, taking risk jobs etc. There is a really good book The Rational Male by Rollo Tomassi who explains the reason of so many divorce rates and the evolving phases a woman undergo in her life. Lastly, it isnтАЩt wise to say women to be at home and nurturing the family because everyone should realise what they can contribute to build a healthy family. If the objective is to both parents being out for work and send their children to daycare then this isnтАЩt a family but an organise market govern by state."

ItтАЩs a topic of big argumentative. I believe on feminism strongly but also my belief is: in some sector girls are stronger than men or boys. Also same in some sectors boys are stronger are than women or girls. ItтАЩs by natural. ItтАЩs true we both have similarities by body parts unless 2/3. But thatтАЩs not the main point because we are running by our brain power also HORMONES. They are controlling us by our ways. Finally in some fieldтАЩs job or factors where gender doesnтАЩt matter their we have to be feminists to make our society nice and peaceful. Thanks.

"Yes, feminism is about equal rights and opportunities. While men donтАЩt always vocalize their struggles as much, women actively fight for their rights. I believe that movies shouldnтАЩt promote toxic behavior, and while the film тАШAnimalтАЩ does show toxic behavior, I donтАЩt think it glorifies it as much as some claim. However, toxic men are influenced by it, just as women might be influenced by shows like тАШFour More Shots,тАЩ which I think does glorify certain behaviors.

In this video, Dhruv Rathee mentioned some feminists who address issues on both sides, and I believe these are the real feminists. They speak up when women are oppressed but also when women are the oppressors. True feminism involves advocating for justice and equality for everyone, regardless of gender. Being silent when men suffer isnтАЩt true feminism. Unfortunately, there are people who claim to be feminists but remain silent when men suffer, and thatтАЩs not in line with genuine feminist values. And they are not feminists but they claim to be feminists."

Exact meaning of Alpha male:
An alpha male is an alpha male because he takes care of the tribe. In times of war and famine he eats last in exchange in peace time he gets to eat first. But that's not the goal the goal is he is"

"God originally created women to raise children and take care of the family. And created men to earn by hard work.  But if a woman has no means, she can earn . Remember one thing we are not wiser than the creator. The more a man works, the more his testosterone hormone will increase or his masculinity will increase. And if women leave the family to raise children like men If he works hard, he will develop a masculine mentality.  Don't want to have children. In this way, the human race will disappear.  Remember one thing if man and woman were one then you would not exist."

"If any one says patriarchy means beating, insulting, or degrating the position of female then its not true, if it is commonly practice in anciant time( becouse not atall posibal in modarn time) then its wrong.. This is a negative side of petriarchy which arise from social evil( becoz wrong people always do evil thing, and it has no treatment / semilarly wrong women always take advantages of feminism in a evil way, even though feminism is good for socity) . ..  There is a positive side of patriarchy, which gives us not Exactly equall amount of rights (which is not posibal for various physical emotional bondages) but in a fair propotunate based on law of nature.. Every body is not equally efficient in dowing evey work... Therefor acording to the law of nature man / women devide their work acording to their capability of dowing the work efficiently.. Irrespect of modarn man made philosophy but the genune truth is man and women are not same from any condition, so plese ЁЯЩП sorry but absolute  equality cannot be lies here.. So petriarchy devide the positon of male, female for social benifits acording to law of nature.. Is the positve aspect of petriarchy..."
"Petriarchy is not bad but very important for every domestic affair.. Becouse in every place their must be a head, boss, ledar.. Same in family there must be a head not to disturb u but to controll... There is lot to say why a male member needs to be head of a family, some of the reson u may recognize... Thats why in short petriarchy is not bad.. But yes in this long run of petriarchal history some dark and negative mening of it has been attach which shod be condamed.. Itself patriarchy is not bad but some negative mindsat has attach whic is shown in this video very clearly... On the other hand feminism has also some negative impact in this socity, which u can also see in present and so call modarn socity.. I hope dhrub sir will also make a video soon showing too much of being feminism is also dangerous for family, socity, and female too.. Too much of any thig is dangerous is my point.."
"In my opinion, men and women are made differently with biological and physical differences, but both deserve to be equally treated with equal opportunities. Its a fact that we get to see most of the mine workers, construction workers and soldiers are men. On the other hand, most of the teachers, nurses and babysitters are women.  As all of these are important, we must respect both the genders. However, we must also encourage if a girl wants to become a pilot or become a soldier or a man wants to look after his children and do housework. Here, I didn't mean to demean any gender but to make all realise that it's not men vs women but men and women. All of us deserve to live our own way of life. And we must respect those who deserve it, irrespective of gender."

"16:40 Patriarchy is not destroying anything. Don't forget it's the ""Patriarchal System"" that's been going on since the early ages and all these technologies + infrastructure that you see around yourself was made possible under the Patriarchal System. I myself support women's rights but when movements like Feminism is only famous for their vulgarity & toxicity like their counterparts (toxic masculinity in animal movie etc) what do you expect? If you want to see the detrimental effects of feminism then you should see where it's coming from. See the american family system, see the family courts in the United states, see how they are not able to define what a woman is. This is a path which will lead you astray. 

All those toxic (stupid) kids with childhood issues who labels themselves as ""Alpha"" or ""Sigma"" Male are equal to those feminists with daddy issues."

"Feminism is the worst topic to discuss women may get some rights to study or work or support his family but their is one most hidden nature of females is when they achieve something they do not understand something next to it due to this nature the surrounding get effected when the man earn they always support their family their wife and children but when the women earn 80% they do not understand their parents or their husband next to them evn they divorse them and even they start going with this dirty relationship with the man's so this is not fair with the mans they are not fools to marry them and take their responsibility of the man would have same feelings as a women so many will never marry to anyone and the whole upcoming generation will be destroyed 

Women cannot be like mans never never they always treats man like dogs they just marrry rich man why because they required money and sex from us nothing"

"Exactly that same situation happened to me ,when i am in college,i tried to be friendly and more outgoing to remove shyness and i talk to everyone,so i made lot of friends including boys and girls but after sometime my male friends used to tell me that ,those girls who are not friendly and do not hangout with guys are more sanskari and jave more respect in men eyes and they want to marry those type of girls and your tupe of girl usually,people doubt on your character,that u are easy
I was shocked and sad ,i was just being friends with everyone,how can this says anything on my character,mene kya galat kiya
Tb se i didn't make any male friends and i don't talk to boys much, only when its needed related to study,otherwise i don't 
Because that's how some boys think
She is too easy ,and she is not sanskari  (patriarchal mindset)
I was stupid that i was also following this to came in the criteria of sanskari but now i feel 
I don't want to prove it...i am a nice girl and if they judge me that their problems not mine"

Could please make a video on dowry death and divorce rate
Fulan Devi ka bhi koi video banai hai sar
in my cast i have seen giving girls equality but it turned out to that my cast girls have become shameless now. They wear exposing clothes and have 5 or body counts even divorced more 3 times and 90% of the time it was boy who was a good guy and still suffered. That's why i don't believe in equality like this.
The fact is that we don't try to know the actual truth.  We just try to justify our thoughts with a few news and infos . Its the main problem ongoing in this society. We often doesn't want to know the truth but always try to defend our thoughts and we often feel happy when the opposite gender getting hates. I feel the main reason here is ego. We want to justify our ego and thats what makes it worse

Worst video bro the main thing is when a boy is rich he can change a poor women's life but a rich woman will never ever look at a poor man
Yes men and more violent than women.
"I personally want women to be on par with men, but there are somethings we cant change, like the biology of male and female..
Men are built stronger than women in many aspects and they take advantage of that better stats to be the better than their female counterparts.
We have to accept this, there are some areas where women cant beat a man 1 on 1 no matter what happens.
But does that mean we shouldn't encourage women to do it, absolutely not...
We need to encourage and give opportunities to women in the exact same way we give to men, but just be realistic and fair.

I personally dont believe in equality, rather i believe in equity.
If the person has potential to complete a job regardless of what gender he or she is they have to be given the same opportunities and chances to shine, and paid on what and how they did the work efficiently, if the men did it better because it requires some good physical attributes then he has to be paid more. But the problem is, if the same happens then the toxic feminist will come and cling like they are showing patriarchy, im not paid as same as him.

Feminism was and is great and good for the women who really deserves it, but there are people who wants revenge on men and wants to control men, just because our forefathers did the same, this what draws the line 

As long as feminists wants equity they can have it, but if they want superiority, man then starts the gender wars 

If you have the potential to do something there is nothing that should stop you from doing the same, if something does, then you have all the rights to fight for it ......"

The ideology of feminism and reality of feminists aren't same .
Most of feminists are toxic.
"" We don't need men"" most of the Feminists think like that. They love to criticise men but blind to women's fault. They hate and disrespect men. It's true. I notice that.
Neither i like hard patriarchy nor feminism."

And if a boy or man slap them back people will say see he slap the girl how is it equal by the way ?

"*So let's be real now*

Feminism does not define equality because ""Feminism"" is subjective and ""Equality"" is objective.

Equality is real and should be implemented so Women can Vote and do Jobs if they have to but it's not necessary and I think we all can agree that a woman's actual biggest fever in real Life is to support her family emotionally because scientifically speaking women are more emotional and mentally and physically weak s soft, and that's absolutely attractive, powerful, healthy, better for a Good women and aggressively needed by men. Only with these kinds of women have we as Men thrived in Technology, Moral standards, Health, politics, economy, and most Important Emotional well-being through the ages.

Feminism is delusional/fake and should be stopped because it's a cancer with Hypocrisy. Many feminists don't want equality they straight-up hate men, Why? because no men want a Little screaming Girl to be their wife, Talk about feminism until a thief broke into the house. Feminists will do Jobs but being a mother and cleaning s cooking for children and husband is too much burden, who will marry a girl who talks delusional equality of feminism. They want a cultured, charismatic, tall, strong, father figure man but don't have any qualities that men want of a Mother, a Wife. feminism is the Ignorance/Immaturity of delusional females.

"I am a Muslim and by cast a Pathan but I am a feminist because I want my daughter to be a pilot, a doctor, an engineer or an athlete whatever she want to do because Islam dosn't stop any female to do something for society even if you read the life of our Beloved Prophet Muhammad SAW, he awarded many women who did good for society and also made a nursing home and also gave a necklace to Hazrat Ghifarya RA on her services during war and even in pendimics. This is the real Islam and even every religion do that, no religion stop women to do something for society."

"Dhruv you have to understand that a female as WIFE is in a role designed by God.
An individual unmarried girl does not fall in this role .
Neither Patriarchy is good nor Matriarchy but God has a designed role, do not go UNKNOWINGLY  against standards of God.
He has more understanding than u, me or any other human.
It is guaranteed that with rise of feminism divorce will rise.
Im sure ur not aware of power of prayers, or you have never talked to God and understood his views.
That's why ur touching a complex issue without much understanding.
Im not supporting patriarchy but u need to understand few things. This is true that in terms of money, or career or certain more things females have equal rights. But marriage is an institute and we need more righteous kids to be born. A normal male can be a successful businessmen,  or have good career or can even cry but we also need males whose prayers are accepted by God. Otherwise things will become worse like divorce, or birth of more unrighteous kids being born.  Plz try to understand how spiritual world operates"

"Dhruv Rathee.. i just want to thankyou.. for making such a wonderful and unique video on you tube.. u literally won my heart today i like your other videos too but this video really touched my heart.. we need more intellectual ""humans"" like u who speaks for humanity.. people who are bad.. and maybe aren't humane blame everything on ""KALYUG""... but they dont know.. ki jis yug mein hum jee rhe hai vo hum par depend karta hai but no one actually wants to change in a positive way.. just bcz of the toxic culture around that being bad and abusing someone makes u look ""cool"" and ""strong"" sadly.. and honestly there is no logical explanation for that neither it is written in Gita or vedas.. its just that.. ppl are blindly consuming whatever they see on internet or those youtube shots called attitude status.. giving cheap dopamine to the youth of our country.. and there are endless points which i can give.. but its highly imp for us to know that the youth is getting deteriorated day by day.. and maybe your videos may bring a positive change in the society and would help to transform us.. i dont consider myself as perfect .. u changed my own thought process too.. i highly recommend u to make more videos on such topics which would change our thought process and makes ur more humane.. thankyou so much again тЭг"

"Don't forget Guru Nanak who said "" why call women inferior who gave birth to Great people,kings philosophers, saints, warriors etc. in fact,through women, future generations come,within woman man is conceived""."
"Many people don't understand the difference, and very well explained."
"First of all Men and Women are not the same. The diversity between two of them and the differences of thought between them is the most beautiful thing in this world. Yes Men work, Men donтАЩt cry, Men build, Men fight, Men feel absolutely amazing when they work on their physique, Men feel great when they conquer this world life has always been hard for them and they grow from this. IтАЩm a Man and I can say these are the things that makes me feel fully alive. The Masculine side of Men and the feminine side of Women is the NatureтАЩs beauty and what keeping our society at place otherwise society will collapse for sure. They canтАЩt be same when it comes to natural behaviours and thoughts (which current bs feminism promotes) Biologically they are different and they have very different perspectives about this world believe me or not! It has nothing to do anything with any woman who is trying to build their career, working hard for a goal. ItтАЩs very nice for them if thatтАЩs what keeping them happy. But the truth is Men and Women are not the same but yes they can be treated equally politically, and they can be given equal rights, 

and tell me this what rights are Men getting that women donтАЩt? Idk what.

Idk whether feminism has such a beautiful concept like dhruv explained but Western as well as Eastern society has taken it in a very ugly way like тАЬFour shots bullshit seriesтАЭ and many 
- Behaving like a Man
- Ugly revealing dressing 
- Objectifying Men
- Saying all men are same
- Sleeping with 40 Men
- Partying and smoking too much.

Again these are the same things that are destroying Men also.
So the war is not between Men and Women. The real war is spiritual between these satanic and demonic rituals and bs agendas which is destroying this worldтАЩs society.

Of course 

I totally agree with dhruv what he is saying but Feminism has to stop because real feminismтАЩs concept is disappeared in todayтАЩs age and will never come back!!"

"Females ko har jagah 50% ka adhikaar hona chahiye aur males ko 50%...

Lekin dhruv, aurat kabhi bolti hai, ""sharm aurat ka gehna hota hai"", Aur jab aaj unko open adhikar mil gaye hai to wo nangi ghum rahi hai...,

Aisi bahot si baatein hai...

Lekin Haan, bilkul aurato ko aadmi ke barabar adhikaar hona chahiye har jagah...."
Bhai tum par beeti nahi hai isaliye aisa bol rahe ho. Mere 2 dosto ne wife ko pareshan hokar suicide kar liya hai. Court passed judgement against the husband even he was not guilty and in the favour of wife even she was guilty. And his wife harrased him for dowry and maintenance. He was not able to earn even to feed himself but he paid her more than his capacity. Finally he committed suicide.ЁЯШв He was my best friend ЁЯШв

"IMO itтАЩs impossible to attain 100% feminism in this world because some women still believe in patriarchy and if women themselves think that then itтАЩs just another good reason for a man to believe he has all the decision making power.

Also IтАЩve noticed that some of the reason behind this is the kind of serials made by the industry. IтАЩm still baffled by the thought that nobody has raised a complaint against these kinds of serials. Some may say itтАЩs funny and just for entertainment purposes but some may believe everything they show on TV is real and is applicable in real life."

IтАЩm not allowed to go out and work. 
Stalkers creeps starers everywhere.
Even if I am, Picking a profession will be surrounded by narratives like тАЬthatтАЩs a manтАЩs job тАЬ
If I get raped by my husband, no action can be taken 
The chances of getting raped if I go out alone at night is extremely high and 100% in certain places. 
I have to obey my husband, no opinions from my side
I have to take my husbandтАЩs last name. Loss of identity 
I have to leave my house and live at his.
I should suddenly detach from my parents and accept his parents as my own
Zero social life after marriage meanwhile husband gets to go out with his friends in the name of office obligations
CanтАЩt wear what I want 
If I get raped (which I have) itтАЩs my fault. I can never forget the looks I received from the police constable while asking me the details of my rape. Parents withdrew the complaint because the rapist was my relative and they wanted to protect his reputation. MineтАЩs gone though. IтАЩm the one whoтАЩs raped but IтАЩm suffering way more than him. My parents are so ashamed of having me."

I would suggest Dhurv Rathee to study Contents from Dhravidar Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu a movement by EVR Periyar. These things will be more simplified and understood by general public in Tamil Nadu by Periyar's teachings
"I am in the side of girls(I'm a man). Women have been suppressed for many years. They should not be suppressed. But their is something else. The true meaning of feminism should not be applied to the society. I am against that.

In the 1st sight someone would think that I'm a patriatic but that's not the case.

Women are different than men. They are beautiful in their own way. They should not be compared or have same rights as men. If you say that men can walk on streets without a shirt then women should also be able to do so-It can't be done. Women can't do equal work like men.


Women should have equal rights but in some cases. They can't be provided with same equal rights for getting job(as men can do much better physical works quicker than them), but women should able to free and independent (kinda), and many other cases"

"I am not against equal rights..but whats happening around the globe in the name of feminism and women rights ? Capitalism wants women to work and leave households..but is it efficient for the society as a whole? Just like not everyone needs to get married, there is no need for everyone to run after career.. Priorities are the answer.. There are more social factors and equations that need to be addressed.. I believe such an intelligent guy like Dhruv Rathee will someday see the glitches in the matrix regarding this matter."

"Kitni shameless baat he k motherhood became the cheapest role in our society.
Mother's is a great role.

Agr bachay peda krna ya zyada bachay peda krna(aik hi baat he) illiteracy se belong he to what about the females who are scientists doctors have more than 2 kids.
My m-phil processor has 5 kids, we are five and well educated.
Bhai bacha aik peda karo ya das agr parents aik hi peda kry pr usk childhood se le kr young hood tak uski koi responsibility ni uthaty to wo society k lyi aik toxic he."
"I don't need to be a mother, or housewife to be accepted in my family, I think each gender has a specific role in our society, if my husband earns for me it is my responsibility to take care of my kids to feed them to wash my husband clothes, it is honor to me if I responsibly give him breakfast, lunch, dinner and whenever he wants.
Look, if an air hostess, a waitress serves the customer without any irresponsibility, why not a husband or father who fulfills our desires and gives us a roof, gives us the luxury of life, so if I decide to do the same job as my husband does, it would be difficult for me to do laborious job and settle family as well. It is worth full for me being a woman to take care of my husband and my instead of taking financial responsibility.
If husband and wife both go for work, and they hire a baby sitter, what if a female baby sitter has such a husband who do don't allow her to share financial responsibility and just sit at home and take care of his kids, after all she is feeding and taking care of others kids and they are paying certainly amount to her within which she has to limit her needs, on the hand it would be grateful to her to take care her own kids and husband, and she is not bound to her husband to give her pre decided amount or salary because she is not his servant afternoon all, the husband must fulfill her and his kids needs, this is totally beautiful patriarchy system under which a woman is not like air hostess, waitress or a baby sitter who need to obey all the time her boss, if she is off duty and salary would be definitely cut out. 
What's wrong with of a woman is well educated and take care of her family.
Our Society and our general need parents to be responsible for their roles. 
Oh, if someone says, why not a  male can take care of family, I swear it wouldn't be easy for them to do so, because everyone man is not earning by having Good job, someone feed their kids and family by loading heavy goods and machinery, can a woman do the same as they do.
So every gander has a specific role, that our society need to understand.
Every woman is not a doctor, teacher, engineer or scientist.
So woman is generally responsible for her family.
Man also has responsible to take care of his family, like earning, grocery, feeding his kids whenever his wife is busy, but he is not as worthy as woman by nature."
Being a true feminist means knowing that patriarchal mindsets cause challenges for both men and women.

"Matriarchy is also a widespread problem like patriarchy. Matriarchy  WAS NOT addressed well enough in this video.

"The height thing is too real. There were many studies done on it and it was found out that women consistently find taller men more attractive. But im not very sure about the reason. The data showed too much consistency, so does it signify that patriarchal views are so much prevalent in all countries?? Can it be because women are biologically more attracted to taller men even when they arent in contact with patriarchal views?"

Brother who loves his sister soo much. Always support his sister. And now this happened only for feminism . Because of she has a job and feminisms in her mind . If she go out from home with her friends for party or traveling. If her father don't allow to go . Then she forgot that he is her father. She directly said now I am an indipendent girl. Soo don't teach me what to do or what not to do . Here she started disrespect her father. Father,who sacrifice everything for this girl . This is soo harmful for our sisters.

who is the speaker at 9:48? I want to listen to her speeches.
"Dhruv, genders are not equal from a scientific point of view. Our developmental path is not same. Our physical ability is different. Our hormonal systems are not same. That is a biological fact. Our emotional needs are also different. There are quite a lot of scientific studies that point to women have different preferences and behavioural patterns that are not followed by men and vice versa. So if we start forcing people and their choices based on gender we are walking the wrong path. I will talk about individual choice in this context. What humanity needs is the respect for individual choice.   
But we can work for equal rights for both genders under law and policy.  Indeed, woman can work jobs, fend for their family and be equally contributory to society. The question of feminism is about equality under law, not forcing narratives like patriarchy. It is about every girl finding out for herself what is right for her and what role model she want to follow. Often they look at their mother and their experiences. The problem with 4th way feminism currently underway is that it has become toxic. It is a politicised movement in the west that has grown into become labelled as ""woke"" where you get to see LGBTQ+ men suddently declaring themselves as women and participate in womens sport. Suddenly these substandard athletes become the top grade. That is intellectual dishonesty. This woke movement is an agenda of the Elisitst Corporates of the west, who wanted to take advantage of the Cheap labour that women provided. 

The problem is here that a very complex topic is again presented  with lopsided statements such as mens issues can be handled by feminism. No it is because men are human beings  and we psychological distinct from woman. Stating anything else is a lie not a scientific fact. There are natural outlets for boys to vent out their emotions when growing up.That involves some rough play also. Why do you think gladiatorial sports like MMA and boxing enjoy so much popularity?  Why do you think that most popular sports amoung men are often phyiscally intensive in nature. That women sports have a fraction of the viewership of mens sport? 

In the name of patriarchy most men's issues are being politicised and painted a dark color. Isnt interesting that it is the women often talking about mens violence and issues. Why are men not being consulted? Why are men not talking about their issues. It is because we talk about it amoung men. You tube is full of content channel that talk about these issues and their audience and participation is heavily leans on men. This is because men/boys have greater propensity to men(Actors, Sportsmen, male Polticial leaders) as role models. The attempt to form groups and gangs by boys with only men in that is not abnormal. There are several scientific studies showing the need for boys and men to have peer groups and the benefits of that.

Since when did the word masculine has become associated with the word ""Toxic"". Everytime that word is taken up in the media it is associated with toxicity as if men and their natural state is violent, misogynist, self indulgent and irresponsible individuals. Sad state is that a large number of boys when they grow up get through a rebellious phase where they exhibit some of these traits for social acceptance or identity  establishment. Alpha male is a reality. Not a ""Toxic"" aboimination. Please spend some time researching the evolution of the species and the role of the Alpha male especially amoung our direct ancestors.  And the best antidote is not feminism but good father figures who are present in their lives. Help them find their own identity. Become examples for them. Mothers are important too, but for this need a father is the role model.
 
Meanwhile we all have Fathers at home.  Many can attest how they quietly take on the world, work hard,  particiapate in the well being of the family unit. Often they play an important role out in the society, spending time away from family. That often they go through the same emotional problems of stress and expectations but take on those challenges for the love of their family.  How they love their children irrespective of gender. How they are the most effected in case of divorce since they have no natural rights to child custody as women enjoy. That there is huge problem where woman in the west especially are abusing that right to cheat a There are several TED talks too about the same.

Yet the feminist almost always zooms on the few toxic  inidividual who are failed fathers. One major index to look at the number of talk shows and programmes focusing on feminism and the rights of woman. Why is age old institution like family is often pictured in a unfavourable light in the media? 

Another point to look at is the state of decline in the West and there are now big debate going on the influence of 3rd way feminism in destroying the family fabric. Over 50% of African American families are now single parent with mother in custody. And the most problem group of errant boys/men are from that group. Lawlessness, crime, drugs have overtaken most black neighbourhoods. Social scientist are talking now about how 3rd wave feminism has misguided a generation of women and men. How Liberal Socialism have created the decline of Black America"

@dhruvrathee y im getting ad of bjp ads on u r video ЁЯШо
My opinion .... Its not easy for either men or women in this world  and its getting harder for children coz they have to grow up to the men and women of tomorrow and there are privilege for both men and women and most of the privilege are being abused and this has to be fixed not as a community but by every individual and the community is supposed to show the direction....fake it or be it .....just make it.
According to me I don't think it's important to work out side the house to be equal... I mean it depends wht the couple decides .. to work out a family one has to take care of his/her kids. It doesn't mean it always has to be a woman. Earlier times in India we had women to play both the roles at some families women were working outside to earn and some took care of the kids and their husbands earned. But after the invaders arrived women were advised to switch their roles to stay at home. And then it continued and became a compulsion.

"the simple fact is being a man is a privilege... in India as a 20 year old being a woman is living in constant paranoia, and fear of men checking you up and down or that of being abducted and raped, and the society being quick to blame us for anything and everything while for men instead of calling them uncivilised, ""boys will be boys, they are adventurous and violent due to raging hormones""
can we all just feel safe? we talk a lot about feminism but the root cause of all problems lie in the mentality of people, the vicious trio of the govt+police+media which can frame anything however they want to and all deserve to be arrested under our constitution, we are run by criminals, thats the problem, a country run by people with criminal mentality and no sense of justice will have crime in it
Bollywood also has a lot to do with why men feel entitled to sexual violence and how they view women as nothing but sex toys
As human beinga we all must dress modest but forcing not to and slutshaming women for wearing jeans and a top is just normalising and justifying rape culture whichis SO WRONG"

"I have watched a lot of dhruv and now I understand why people call him that he only highlights things to support his point of view, he very easily potrayed that the way the society is built is wrong but didn't emphasize on why the society today is this way, there is for sure a lot of problems in the society we live in but he did not take into consideration the biological and political factors that have influenced and shaped the things the way they are, there are a lot of things that could have been highlighted about the issue, I won't be mentioning the points as people already do know what I am trying to say, Thank you for your time...."

Notice how even after the video talks about how feminism isn't something bad but something important for both men and woman and still some brainless people are fighting against women in the comments. Also the fact that they only put replies to comments by talking sh*t and insulting women instead of bringing in facts.

Another thing is patriarchy is responsible for so many young m3n and boys being k1lled in wars. Suppressing emotions in m3n causes m3n to burst out in other ways. Most of the v10lent crimes are commited by m3n and most of the victims are other m3n.

"The internet has given stupid people like me a platform to raise their voice and it hurts all the sensible people too.
Man you have courage to make a video on this explosive topic. I concur with most of what you say and I am against women bashing ""studs"" but one thing that needs to be addressed is legislation and proper, timely execution of the said legislation. The horrible things that women are subjected to make us feel that laws need to be more stringent while ironically the present laws sometimes leave men defenseless and are abused to hell by some people(which is natural as lawyers' intention is to win a case) which in turn could be a factor in making many young men harbour patriarchal thoughts and avoid women altogether which can't be good for a healthy society. It hurts careers of both women and men."

"He is completely devoid of ground understanding on why people are talking about toxic feminism. During start of video, he tried to portray their are also mentioned who throw acid on women. Toxic feminism is not recognising that there are girls too who throw acid on men for not agreeing. At the extreme several feminist do not even consider this a case fit for discussion, on the contrary some feminist celebrate it as pay back for ""years of oppression"". There are several similar incidences. The people who actually see things around are aware of these things. One may give zillion of argument, but literally the toxic version of feminism has made entire society divided on gender and taught society to doubt individual on basis of their gender and this includes even mentioned doubting the women of their intention."

"Feminism was good, but today I see no rights that men have over women(not talking about third world countries). I personally have no problem with feminism, and women should have equal rights. But  the thing that triggers me is that modern day feminists talk sh!t that they dont need men, or all men are rap!st. In my opinion, neither of us can live without each other, and toxic feminists are ruining the society. Another thing hat should be changed is that the unfair discrimination no one talks about. A woman slaps a man, ""wow she is so bold and brave"". Man does the sane thing, ""coward, rap!st, misogynist"". A wise man once said, ""equal rights, equal lefts"""

"I don't think people are intentionally doing this, most of the people are doing this because they are confused to understand this word ""Feminism"""
"One side our epic books shows different statement about patriarchy, to be more specific..it's all about how female characters are bound to follow their culture and  accept all customs to live as virtuous women between society.

Time changed too much, it's not like you will follow all those words which is written on there! Living in present by being true human, you don't need to learn things from different places but you just need to understand by exchanging your position between opposite character."

"I am a Muslim and I do not believe in feminism or anything else.  Because in this era, girls are becoming more uneducated than educated.  They think that the world is only theirs.  Islam has the rights of girls, they need to be cared for and loved.  But they want to get out.  I am replying to 2 questions of your video.  If the girls stayed at home then no one could understand whether her husband is tall or short.  And even though Islam has given women a lot of support, they don't want to accept it.  Feminism is not good or bad, we want our mothers, sisters, wives to stay at home and not be noticed"

"But you know what is the real point? In our modern generation, most of the so called feminist women doesn't even know what is the real feminism is. And that's so pathetic ЁЯЩВ"
"You missed one point. You kept mentioning and explaining ""asli"" feminism in most of the video. Most people don't have a problem with that ""asli"" feminism. And you missed that the ""asli"" feminism you keep talking about is in the back. When you see an average feminist, she is not influenced from that ""asli' feminism rather she's influenced by toxic feminism. And the way you kept generalising all anti-feminism men, ""chapri alpha male"" is clear bias. This is hypocrisy from your side. If you look at it, most of the feminists are chapri ""girl power"" females too.
This whole anti-feminism thing was a reaction, as for it be anti something, that something has to exist first. And that something is those ""chapri girl power"" feminists which you failed to show, are the majority. Also, you failed to honestly deliver the differences between men and women. Not everything is the fault of patriarchy. If men are more emotionally resilient (biologically proven btw) and physically stronger (also biologically proven) then it would of course be natural that shouldn't cry as much as women and while it is bad, a part of men's nature IS to fight. It is only sensible that men get into more fights. As I said, you portrayed it as patriarchy's fault while it is nature. Patriarchy didn't form itself. It formed because it aligns with nature. Of course you shouldn't shame a man for crying or not engaging in fights, but doing the extreme opposite of this is actually wrong too."
"i think its more about the image that society is created of a women rather than it having a cultural or religious impact. people give an excuse of it being religiously incorrect for a women to do certain things when it is totally opposite. people don't even know what their religion or culture has to offer and still label it as ""culturally accurate"" because as far as ive learnt and my elders have always taught me is how beautifully our religion has always respected women and provided them with equal rights infact pray women and never restrict them or force them to not focus on their career and marry at a young age or wear a certain piece of clothing ."

"There is a wave of anti-toxic feminist movement in the developed world but we are moving towards this toxic ideology. They seen how this ideology destroyed the families, Mothers are now realising that they spent so much of their precious time working for others instead of spending time with their precious children, they have let the others indoctrinate their children."
"Why don't you show the data where the feminist socity are more depressed and have more devorce rates, a divorced women would have to work more to raise her children and children would be without a father figure and most likely will indulge in criminal activities because of lack of parental love and care, study shows it. Femisits society  promotes cheating with their life partners(both male and female)."
Now a days Priyanka Chopra jonus is a brand ambassador of feminism.
"тАЬEvery action has its equal and opposite reactionsтАЭ

- WomenтАЩs & children rights should be protected at any cost.
- Both Genders have their own duties and responsibilities as assigned by the nature and no one can change if we try to modify the principles of nature then the first thing that will be destroyed is Family culture and I believe that specifically the subcontinent is a place of Moral values, Cultural and religious values and I think it is a beauty of our land. There will be people who will never satisfy with my point but why I am saying this is because all these feminism, LGBTQ and bla bla is originating and coming out from WEST and if you look in to the cultural values of these nations are disastrously Corrupted No matter how much money they have or Who own GUCCI PRADA this and thatтАж
- Males are designed to lead and provide the house and womenтАЩs are designed to nurture and upbringing of the childrenтАЩs ( It does not means that she has to be treated as a maid that is why I mentioned that the rights should be protected under the state and law) and if she wants to do business or Work she is allowed to do but not on the price of her character, Chesty, Modesty which means WOMENS ORIENTED JOBS has to be created.
- Now if we talk about the EQUAL RIGHTS of women I totally agree with the point but the first thing that comes before equal right is WHAT ROLE ASSIGNED TO WHOM By the nature. Our Physical appearances, Thought Process, React/Response towards situations, Emotional stability, Mental strength, Dressing, Voices and many other examples indicates that both genders are different and has no comparison at all.

Lastly I would just remind all of my friends that Why we are following the footsteps of WEST and getting into stress, Love towards the worldly life and forget about the death, Cheating, Women Abuse, Drugs, Hopelessness, Depression, Anxiety  ect ect ect. ─░nstead of creating our own processes and inventions So many people from our subcontinent are leading the world in Technology, Sports, Innovations, Service Sectors.

In our time we are facing the arguments and practices of Feminism and no one knows how far it may lead the women to be treated in our society. 

тАЬWe respect womenтАЩs and protect their rights not on the cost of there Innocence тАЬ

I support your content and there are videos and points where my view are different or opposite but specifically on the matters like this I want to advise you that dont make videos on such topics as it is a part of great game between good and bad, right and wrong, Evil and good.

"Today's news
A grandson stabbed and killed the mother of his father for harassing and constantly berating his mother.
A woman is her enemy.
Such prejudices, traditions have played havoc with women's lives. Majority of the victims are women, irrespective of caste, class, creed or religion.
To dominate is a weakness and domination is an attempt to hide this weakness.
Women and  men should take equal responsibility in every sphere of human society, family organizations govt. And they should equal opportunity in every enabling activity like education.
They should be equally accountable for their actions 
But thousands of years of prejudices traditions take a long time to overcome
There is another most heinous prejudice i.e women's purity lies in virginity before marriage and should be faithful to the husband in marriage but man need not be so"

Anyways, saw your video immediately after that and I realized, not all men think like garbage and happy that indian men are actually a bit better. The western men are actually frustrated with women's promiscuity which equals those of men here and they turn a blind eye to their own similar behavior. This is actual hypocrisy. Both pillars of the society are getting porous from within and the value system based on religion promotes this hypocrisy to the best possible extent."

"Damn!!! Many might have clicked on this video to get a dose of feminist bashing but might have instead got an education on gender rights, feminism and equality. Well done, Dhruv !!!!!"
"a fan of this channel but at 2:44 the statement that every rational person is a feminist is a big mistake. Its totally the opposite.
feminism claims that men and women are equal but actully they are different. They claim that men and women have equal rights  but in reality its imposible as women always refers to men to enforce their rights.  physical superiority of men is the sole reason of men dominance. There is no way around these facts, bitter but true and natural."

"In the face of nature we are nothing but mere creatures with higher intelligence than other species
And as the saying goes "" Nature is neither kind nor harsh, it`s just a truth we all must obey. It is a truth which is enforced by Gods on their children to make sure the children know that it doesn`t matter if you are strong or weak , clever or foolish , and a man or a woman , you will be punished by it`s judgement.
So, the least we can do is try to to make ourselves better and someone stronger so that we can prove that we are the ultimate creation of the rulers and origin of creation, the GODS itself"""

""" Women are superior to Men as they hold children and nurse them. Men kept their girls uneducated,  so they could not ask for their needs. ""
-Jyotibha Phule."
"""The women are not weak but they are made weak."" - Simon de Bouver."
"A great exercise in obfuscation. Sticking to old dictionary definitions of the term or insisting on exclusion of behaviour or attitudes which their practitioners would certainly claim arise out of them being 'feminists' does not make for a sound case. This video's transcript would make for a good bland school essay. Nothing more. Savitribai Phule is in a very old boat. Call it by whatever name, but the concern of many men and women (including Margaret Atwood) is the constant scrutiny and nagging of every small act or gesture of men. Missing a sense of proportion when condemning men's behaviour. And a perennial wish to persecute. At present, it's an exercise to grab power, Mr. Rathee. Either you are blindsided by the new hegemony or you know it and continue with the wishful thinking that 'feminism' would confine itself to the definitions you presented.

Look at the laws, and the policies governments and other organisations keep coming up with. One example, if a minor girl's 'consent' is immaterial because she is not old enough then is it fair to burden the boys with sole responsibility? Of course, case of assault is different. Are all minor boys even taught that they would be solely persecuted for any intimacy with a girl? Line must be drawn a little before. 

Animal is a bullshit film and we need to protect boys from taking any lesson from such crap. At the same time, when you corner someone and hound them until they sing your song then people react irrationally. When you push them to be either with you or against you then you are forcing them to pick the latter.

Have you heard of the phenomenon called identity politics? Most 'feminists' are fond of certain category of statistics. These are a means to an end. The end is power. Some statistics that were absent from the recent NCRB crime data: rising cases of crime by women. Of course, some women committing crime is not any worse than some men commiting crime. However, the current discourse does not let one pay attention to that. 

As for 'patriarchy': Historically the scarcity and the challenge nature presented must have called for great efficiency in social arrangement. Given women's exclusive biological function of giving birth and the associated problems they face because of this it was quite efficient to make them look after the children and the house. Men don't face these biological challenges, hence, it makes more sense for them to be outdoors, be it fighting or working. Of course, this does not mean women should be excluded from decision making, but the truth is they are not. In the 'patriarchal' set-up ask any man who do they consult when deciding what dynamics to keep with other members in joint families. Furthermore, efforts can be made that allow women to overcome these challenges to do other work. This takes us to the next point of 'equality'.

What you are doing is comparing the apples to oranges. Boys from poor or rural families also don't have, and have never had, the opportunities to that middle and upper class boys do. Equality of opportunity is not going to make all occupy higher positions. Most women, like most men, will be another brick in the wall, be it at home or in the office. Equality has also brought us quite a number of women driving e-rickshaws in Delhi. Historically, a small number of men sat on high positions, like they do today, coveted by equally educated women. Their lie is that women will share it equally if most drive rickshaws, become domestic helps, overworked desk workers, etc and some occupy decision making positions."

If you can't stand in pride with a reveling cloth in front of your father, then it is wrong; donig onlyfans and whoring is not empowerment."

As for equal rights and opportunities for both genders, their already existed a term for that called ""Egalitarianism"", way before feminism came into existence."

"Brother , i know that my comment will not change your view on animal movie(not only this film but any film) ... But still its just a film its the director's liberty to show his character or characters in a certain way , and we as viewers can like or dislike it , how can this be cancer?  Will a film change a man or woman ... If a man or a woman changes according to film character its that man's fault.. not the directors or the actors na?  In my view animal was an oke type of movie without no logic and no law and order..  but i enjoyed watching it ...i liked ranbir's character that doesn't mean that i want to be like him ..  i have also enjoyed watching  javier bardem's character from no country for old men ...that was a classic masterpiece and he is more violent than ranvijay ... In the end its just a film ..enjoy it or not your choice but it can cause nothing to viewers ..its like eating a fruit eat the good part and throw away the roten parts. ( My personal view as a movie lover)"

In other case in men's football the whole stadium gets booked which results over billions in revenue 
Still percentage-wise men get less pay than women by that logic"

Matriarchy and patriarchy both are bad and suffering shall not be inflicted on anyone 
It's about living and letting others live
If alimony ruins lives then dowry also does
But does women lift 50 kgs like men? Then can men give birth or nurture children?
Our bodies are different and working together with love and respect towards each other can make the world prosper and I don't know what's better than living in a world where women are not afraid of men throwing acids or assaulting and men not being afraid of someone gaslighting them and taking every responsibility on their children.

"Inspired by this video! Not good enough to be praised, just tried! :(

Ah, must to let off steam about this person called Pat.
I thought he was suave but it turns out he is simply a jerk.

He slithers around, trying to insert his distorted ideas into everybodyтАЩs head
A kind of mind-controlled villain scripted badly like that.

He talks continuously about women and how they should тАЬbehave,тАЭ
As though they were mere ornamental figures meant to please a manтАЩs vanity.

Claims they should keep quiet, be docile, take orders,
Which means that every woman is reduced to just being a puppet without any voice or choice in her life.

And then he adds in this whole spiel about тАЬheaven for obedience,тАЭ
But really what he wants is for them to be hostages under his control.

ItтАЩs sickening really, scary and manipulative too;
Enough to make you want to yell and throw something hard.

But weтАЩre not falling for this ancient bunkum for another moment!
This whole thing of тАЬwomen listen, men ruleтАЭ is over already!

Everyone тАУ boys, girlsтАФit doesnтАЩt matterтАФmutual respect should be the watchword,
PatтАЩs views can go rot in some dark corner of cyberspace somewhere around here.

So letтАЩs remain strong unitedly. Let Pat leave us alone now!
We are trying build a world where everyone has a voice that will be listened to by giving them chances thus far unheard of from us in life. 

No more groveling before these insane laws anymore!
Now we are changing the end; hence it will be happy endings for all the people this time around."
"He talks nothing about casual hook up culture while being in a relationship. Media is trying to normalize it why? 
Fake rape cases filed by women to extort money from men
So called sexual liberation giving men leeway to take any responsibility of their actions. 
Women making easy money through sites like onlyfans and not trying to build a good career

The yaaas queen culture which doesn't hold women liable and women can utter literal shit about man, body shame them, make a reference to the size of their sexual organ and being applauded for the same
Glorifying earning money through only fans and what not"
Guys he is talking about the fringe minority of female who believe in the true definition of feminism not the majority of 'em who r spreading the toxic femininity in the name of equality.

"1. Women empowerment is a sexist word which has been drilled into people's minds. . It must  be replaced by ""HUMAN EMPOWERMENT"". How many of you agree?
2.  how many of you know that there is ""Men's day"" like ""Women's day"". How many of you see mens day status in your friends' whatsapp status?. Very few or rarely. In my opinion, there is no need of women's day. They should change the name of the day.
3. When you state the obvious for enough times, everyone gets annoyed. Like that is the concept of feminism.Feminism concept should be as old as taj mahal by now lol. It has no significance in todays world whatsoever. Also if a word is supposed to mean equality between men and women, then how the hell can one make a word called ""feminism"". It must be ""humanism"""

For acceptance these Women bargain with patriarchy to suppress other women's ambitions

And currently matriarchy is more on rise. If a girl slap u in front of everyone, most probably no one will try to stop but not in case of men. Men will be men is not of nothing. Men have different urges and needs than female and vice versa , whether in human society or in wild. Ur take bout violence , i dont not fully agree with , cause fighting is in our biology in our nature thats why men are called providers cause u have to fight in order to get what u want , this doesnt mean we cant be civilised and participate in violence every time , but if ur a man and didnt had any fight in ur whole life ur not a man .U talked about feminism.., its a very good video , iam a feminist myself , but i will also like to see ur video about matriarchy and patriarchy specifically."

"Yes , lets give 50% jobs of Bricklayer, truck driver, Mines worker, shoe polish, washroom cleaner to women.
Equal right comes with equal responsibility . 

And women should start filling jobs from bottom up, instead of wanting 50% share in high level power positions only."

"Most woman after working for 3-4yrs says ""I wish I get married and need not have to work so much"". Why do they say it? Because woman psychology is built in a way that they choose Hypergamy structure, they want a person to lead, someone to protect, dont have to put so much head into using so much of mind in logical thinking compared to men, they will say they hate Patriarchy mindset, toxic men etc but will seek men to date with toxicity, masculinity. They will loose interest towards men who cries... and this is all utter nonsene. They dont have an ability to take decisions on personal level such that they as for reviews for 3-4 saheli and want men to do most stuff which requires using brain."
"woman will speak to abolish Patriarchy mindset, but will choose a man as per Patriarchy mindset,"
"I didnтАЩt get it. 
First half talked about feminism and its role in the past and it is for equality for both sides, aka male and female. 
But in second half, only talked about what feminism had given to the world, like vote for women, individuality rights at home, etcs , which you only talked about what it did for women. 
WerenтАЩt you the one who talked about feminism doesnтАЩt mean it meant for only women just because it is named as a feminine word. 
After all those talks, you didnтАЩt gave a good example what feminism has done to males? 
Well you didnтАЩt even bothered to talk about what this new waves of feminists are doing to the world in name of feminism. You didnтАЩt even talked about how they are misleading the words feminism, and using it for their advantage. 
You said, тАЬthere were no feminist said what ever the roadies women talked was rightтАЭ but in contrary, there were no feminist denying it too. I donтАЩt see any of these new wave feminist doing anything, ngl. 
And I wonтАЩt even bother start talking about the rights what women has comparing to mens , which is good thing for women safety, but all of them were good? Nothing like advantage? Anywho.
Tbh, women gets equal pay for their jobs. You are smart you know that is debunked, but still talking about that kinda makes me wonder about your intentions influencing the crowd.
I remember you talking about тАЬto make a lie sound true, add a bit of truth and factsтАЭ, kinda sus now.
Nothing against feminism, it was a greatest act for empowering women, but the way you glorified it as itтАЩs for male and female was a nice talk but didnтАЩt have any powerful reason. 
Stating facts (meaning) of something is fine, but you forgot about how the meaning of things changes throughout time decay. 
Taking about the deceased waves now and saying it is good, doesnтАЩt gives the fact that feminism changed its meaning and values according to the different waves."

"There are different schools of thought in the feminist movement and it has changed overtime. 

One specific aspect of the feminist movement is for women to be ""free"" and lead their life as they choose. One aspect of this which must be mentioned because it is an objective is that women must be able to work as sex workers and be accepted and loved in the society, they must be able to have promiscous life and still be accepted without hesitation by future husband, they must be able to have sex with any man or even woman they chose with consent and marriage is not important. The simplest way for women to earn money, fame and appreciation is to become a prostitute/dancer/escort/sugarbaby/stripper/pornstar. This means that as feminist movement becomes strong, expect divorce rate to go up, expect lot of children outside wedlock (bastered children), expect many women to have so many sex partners that they become unable to lead faithful life and as they become old they end up alone with no husband or even children, expect sex work to become widespread. Basically, expect the sex discipline to be lost in society which will lead to most severe chaos in the long run where children grow up in broken homes.

The most proper way to run society is for the male and female nature to be kept separate and not be mixed and have separate well defined roles for them that do not need to be forced into being mixed."

"The real fact is the men and women are equal in totality....they have different responsibilities .....men and women have different responsibilities.....both type of responsibilities are equally important.

So women should be proud of their responsibilities and society should give them respect for fulfilling their responsibilities......and women should opt for such kind of jobs that allow them to live a good family life and give enough time to take care of their children also..

Some jobs like are very tough and require so much time that don't allow women to live their family life.


For example we respect Kalpana chawala a lot....but she was not able to take care of family she got divorce ...so we should have balance


Also women are equal to men...

We don't want to give double responsibilities to women like earn money also take care of home also....so women should do easy and comfortable  job so that to get enough time for family life"

"Your argument about the organs reflects your understanding of the matter. A small difference in the biology does not make them any stupider or well, even tho quite easy to believe by the amount of evidence, less competent. Man and woman are very different creatures, psychologically. Feminism is not just about rights, it's a very corrupted thing. It was in its real form in the last century. Women with the same level of power will use it in a much much worse way than a man, who doesnt use it particularly well either. They did not evolve this way. I dont know what kind of reasoning your boycut writers use, but the truth is, we are glorified apes."

"You will defiantly love the idea of feminism, once you know the true meaning of feminism."
The question is ...kya admiyon ko equal rights diye jayenge ...aurato k brabr
It's just a game of elite people who decides everything about the world
Dil dhrakny do is also a film showing women empowerment
Men and women are not same thats why law seen them differently ....?  Why different law for Men and Women ?
@dhruv you forget to discuss abt special law for females isnt that against equality ? Why feminist support them .....? Think again ...best of luck

Women are more responsible for discrimination....as compared to men especially mother they will always discriminate between boy and girl child .this develops this mentality among boys right from the beginning that they are superior to women .thats why even if they are educated they have a receding mentality.

"I am a feminist 
But i only oppose the dressing sense and vulgarity in dressing of specially girls nd in some cases of boys 
Sometimes social norms are for good they are not always bad ."
"Dhruv Rathee, you are highly confused with the concept of women empowerment and Feminism. The the positive intake belongs to women empowerment and the negative things goes to feminism. And I bet you 90% of male people are feminist because they think feminism and women empowerment is same.
You explained everything correctly from the Start but today feminism = hatred towards Men"
"Patriarchy is bad for men too
So all the men who are here arguing 
So yk what, thus Patriarchy is the only reason of high su1c1dal rates in male cuz u guys are the one who bully your own kind id they're little different from you
Look at our religion where faminism was always a thing
It all changed due to early british era and early mughal era in India
Hinduism never supported patriarchy 
No religion supports violence, injustices and inequality!!!!
Feminism isnтАЩt the problem, supporting one gender more than other is problen whether its a girl or boy !!! Both men and women is important for the society!!!
Feminism isn't again men. Patriarchy is against both genders"
"I think as a men I know what feminism is and I knew it before before anybody told me about this and you don't need to be a professor to analyse this by your own. But I think women should be more educated about what truly feminism is. Because what I have experienced till now is men understands it, it is the women who don't."

"Agreed on many things also disagreed  on many things.. Just 1 thing I wanna point out. At the time of war Women are not forced to go in front line and get killed like a man, they are very protected even now... So thats one of the main reasons that before men didn't like the idea of women vote because its mens life on the line so they wanted to vote accordingly to bring the best govt and serve them...

Also men and women are not same... Both have different roles in society that are equally important...
Don't defame women who don't identify as feminist..."

"Hi Dhruv Equality ! In the Indian society, General conception REGARDING OLD AGE SURVIVEL, GENERALLY MIDDLE INCOME GROUP FAMILIES FIX THEIR OWN PRIORITIES DEPENDING UPON THEIR MONTHLY INCOME. You might have seen that in the houses socities, Many houses are left abondened ! If you have not seern/think , pls do observe as to why it is so ?
Most of such people do not give their property on rent/Lease etc, As they are affraid & sure that after their retirement, For their own uae the said house will not be vocated by the Tanent.
Because of this cause, good number of litigations are pending the Courts from decades together ! Why ?
This is the problem of common person rather than VIP ( Politicians / Seniors retired Officers from the Govt job ie having big say in the society.
On the others hand thousands / Lacks of houses are laying vacent.
Without blaming the people,  blame the Laws made by the Govt / Present Govt for not taking care the problem.
Same problem with the commercial property is more dangerous ( as many times land into MURDER OF EITHER PSRTY because of disputes of property because of the poor Laws / Poor Goverance.
Pls tell me , you have taken my house on lease for 5 yrs. Well in advance I inform you in Writing that next renewal will not be done. Because after my retirement, I will prefer to live in our own house.
Worst part is , If I go to Court , for decades together decision will not come & house will not be vocated.
Apparantly, Who is at fault:-
1. Land Lord 2. Tanent 3. Laws  & Orders ?
It is general Problem.
Would you kindly raise this issue."

The difference between men and women are too deep and at different levels than just two or three organs.
The physiology, psychology etc of two sexes is quite different so much so the form two distinct subsets of a same set. These differences are crucial in determining their social roles. Being humans they are equal in worth and no one is superior/inferior to the other. Rather complement one another to achieve the objective of their being different.

Feminism is to smash patriarchy - out of our lives!
"Talk about women rights and equality but also talk about other side of feminism which is toxic. The way Bollywood is spreading the idea jo aurat jitni nangi hai, gold digger hai, partner py cheating krne wali hai, woh itni feminist hai. Feminism ka asal chehra tabah kar k asal wali feminism ko v badsurat bana diya hai."

"We already know the hypocrisy of Indian feminists groups, in 2011 the govt passed a law to make rape laws gender neutral but the feminist group opposed this law like they are going for a war, this shows the feminism on google and in reality is different"
"Sorry, 'true Indian' social structure's distruction started from the 10 centuray AD and was complete by the 12th centuary. New rhetoric was generated by some to create what is the popular belief system in this southern sub-continent. So what you see today as indian culture was not the culture which you associate with India - the world leader.  Culture - the way of life is what makes a nation, and you can see what the creators of this culture bought true indians to - slavery for the last 12 centuries and still continuing with very good prospects of it becoming a permanent fixture for next few thousand years.Even southern india which was a matriarchal society, is run by male chauvinist's, the example is best painted in the history of Punjab. The only places left untoched were the tribal areas which still maintained their culture but in the last 7 decades that is lost too, instead of learning from them people have taught them the arts of artful dogger. With a super dogger is consider a Superman in this society."

"Feminism is about accepting women at their word, and trusting their actions. They say they're in pain? Then they're in pain. They say a man makes them feel unsafe? That man needs to learn not to do whatever it is that's scaring her. They have the same job as a man? Pay both of them the same wage! Feminism arose because of patriarchy yes, but fighting feminism is like saying someone needs to lose weight without even thinking for a second they're overweight because they'd diabetic and this breaking their food down differently: treat the cause, not the symptom.
Every man should have to take the period simulator. All the way up to 10. Then we can talk about fairness and equality."

I was 7-8 years old and my maternal grandmother passed away that day, I went there and saw dead body of her and i got emotional and was just starting to cry but then i was told that you should not cry for your naani, don't remember exactly who told me but i controlled very hard not to cry i actually controlled that day. But years after i told this incident to my mom and she told me it was wrong you should cry if you wanted to. Whenever i recall this incident ii feel bad for that day...."

Bro u saud ki feminism ki defination girls k liye equal rights hon to bhenchod aurton k liye alrdy 40+laws exist krre h or boys ke liye kitne h??
"That is a very interesting take. Normally, people do not view feminism through this lens. But is feminism really as you claim it to be... Concepts of hyper-masculinity and matriarchy are pushed up at the thoughts of feminism... and I also wonder about one more thing.... What exactly are rights? One might say that they are objectively chosen... but is objectivity something to be supported cause who is this majority who chose these rights... or how were they brought about... and how are we so certain that they are ""objective"" (Note: Objectivity is something extremely modern and was non-existent in the pre-modern and the antiquity)... There are a lot of problems with feminism if we dissect it using philosophy, not that I am against it... Honestly, there is no perfect system that we humans have developed. Locke, Rousseau, Marx and others all tried their best to bring forth promising ideologies but truly none of those ideologies seem to be ""promising"". There is always a flaw... Just like in feminism... and the concept of genders... and the entire notion that they should all have ""equal human rights""... as idealistic as it sounds... in my opinion it causes more harm than good... Of course, anyone can disagree with me...

I should stop... 3 AM thoughts hit different :)
Note: I am not against feminism... Its just that feminism is not a stand alone concept... it brings forth so many other things as baggage or societal concepts with it that it either becomes distorted or harmful."

I think what causes confusion is the word feminism. The term could be coined as equalism so that people who judge the book by its cover wont get confused.
Dhruv sir i think some women also don't know the meaning of feminism. They want equal rights as men which is exactly fine but they don't want to accept the fact that it's alright for a men to earn less than women. even if some women accept this they don't apply this in their actual life.. they want a rich guy... Now some may say she just want secure future.. but why can't she earn herself ? She expects men to earn which is totally bad.

"Definition is nothing. Islam means peace. We know the violence and terrorism of prophet Muhammad. Islam has nothing to do with peace. Feminism claims about equal rights. But it has nothing to do with gender equality. Feminist mindset don't let men cry, feminist mindset push men to be masculine. Patriarchy and feminism are the same thing. Beating men is 3rd wave femnism. Feminism was necessary until 2nd wave. After that, feminism is not necessary anymore."

"We all want equal rights for women. But was it necessary to attack the Hindu religion for that?!
We Hindus have been worshipping Goddesses for thousands of years, but still, you had to target only one religion. 
You didn't speak a word against women's oppression in Islam and the Quran, and neither did you speak a word about misogynist Muslim preachers, why Dhruv?

Now see this,
Quran 4:34: Men are caretakers of women, since Allah has made some of them excel the others, and because of the wealth they have spent. So, the righteous women are obedient, (and) guard (the property and honour of their husbands) in (their) absence with the protection given by Allah. As for women of whom you fear rebellion, convince them, leave them apart in beds, and beat them. Then, if they obey you, do not seek a way against them. Surely, Allah is the Highest, the Greatest.

But you didn't say a word against it, bro will only attack The Hindu religion because that's the easiest way to gain views. Your motive and your agenda are clear Dhruv, running false propaganda against The Hindu culture in the name of social movement.

man you got wrong t some points becuase the rights you talk about boys will ruin our sociaty and make our morals weak also weak men.
"How could you miss this famous name, Simone de Beauvoir, and her famous statement from her famous book, _The Second Sex_: 'One is not born, but becomes a woman.' It basically points out the difference between gender and sex: sex is a biological reality, but gender is a cultural construction. There is no truth as such in one's gender; you just put on your gender the way you put on your clothes. Now, the problem lies in the fact that putting on one's gender is not an innocent act; it is subject to sexual and cultural politics which creates inequality between the sexes."
"But what you are talking about is not currently pushed in feminist propaganda,  you can't ignore the fact that so many women are screaming feminism for multiple partner, hookup culture and stuffs as our body our rules in the name of feminism"
"There's not much inequality now left. This video would be right 10-20 years back.
At this moment of time this video seems overexageratting."
"Being a girl born in India, I can't but get amazed at how intrinsically accepted is the notion of patriarchy. Barabar hain hum. Tum padhai ki baat karo, kam opportunity hone ke baad bhi padhne ki curiosity hamme jyada hain. Gender just society ka idea idea hi reh na jaye. ЁЯЩВ"
"Hi Dhruv, we are eagerly waiting for your impactful awareness videos on the following extremely serious issues/topics, which will be immensely valuable for your viewers and people in general to make an informed decision:

2. SC verdict on Delhi Govt's power over its Executives, and the Rash, Reckless and Authoritarian implementation of Delhi Ordinance by Central Govt.
3. PM Care Funds - Using PM name and face for creating a non govt donation campaign and then absolute secrecy on fud usage and transparency. 
4. ECI Selection Panel - Removal of CJI
5. Bilkis Bano - SC literally calling out in their verdict about the nexus between govt, Gujrat state machinery and criminals
6. Ram Rahim Parole - While Umar Khalid, Manish Sisodia, Satender Jain, Sanjay Singh no bail.

"I'm from Sweden. Feminism is continually humiliating our culture by promoting mass-immigration, multi-culturalism and the destruction of the Swedish man. They will come for you to India!!!!"
Precision of understanding man and woman equal rights means it's mental and soul how you progress equally stronger. But today pic entirely different between man and woman they chasing man any dominating nature how to come up physical way by crook or hook it's kind of toxic computation. But woman not understanding they own  character and respect loosing in the society at home. What you said absolutely right many old methodology understanding between man and woman different way. After all highly educated things are not change still remain same. Why? Bcoz we are moving towards material world. We all seeing and understanding in physical form. Our morality gone down to D grade   spiritually we er not uplifted new generation.  Last 20yrs woman was ruling de our country. Woman was top Leadership and  they have got every rights. Still what de hell woman chasing for rights and equality.  Still our country was most corrupt and women was not insecure crime increase woman exploited in many ways. Neighboring country try to  enter terrorist act increase this all happened under woman was ruling . If woman are  thinking we are weak that's problem within them. But unfortunately woman are more criminal in today's world.
Your all videos are very wonderful and fact based... Thank you sir

"the irony is that the very same feminism which neena gupta calls ""faltu"" has given her the ability to voice her opinion as a woman in the first place. the woman shouting into the microphone and condemning women's liberation can only do so because feminists have been fighting for HER right to speak and these anti-feminism ladies take this for granted.

"No matter what, both the sides have some genuine reasons, they have their pros and cons, so instead of debating on this, we should make a better society focusing on the point of loyalty, kindness and how both men and women would be safe mentally as well as physically. The verses which were written by our ancient ancestors which depicted some norms and regulations regarding society and the culture weren't very wrong, except some superstitions, most of those lines were contained a specific logic and base within them. And, stats are not always the end of debate, those are greatly relevant but we should very much be aware that, but it's not everything."
"I think whatever you told is very big misunderstanding and most of them is wrong, no one created all of this no one influenced anyone to do this it's just nature and Biology, men will be men and women will be women they both have their strength and weakness like a flower and a insect we have different strengths to live in this world, we both are never equal we are just similar looking two different puzzle pieces which makes a design, if you go for an abstract design then you are in the wrong universe you need to go for another Universe in multiverse"

"Hi Dhruv, I regularly watch your videos and agree with you 98% most of the times. Just felt to give my opinion here, I agree men and women should be given equal rights socially and economically. However, there are certain things can be done exclusively by men or women. For example, if your family is in dangerous, it is natural for everyone to turn up to the man to protect them because of their physical strength. Women have better memory and mange finances better. I know these are all opinions but IтАЩm not able to agree with you completely on this one. I respect women and both genders need each other. I just felt your video is putting an unnecessary pressure on people who are satisfied the way their lives are. Your education on the topic feminism is good somehow along the lines, there is some sort of persuasiveness. Hope you take this as a good critique and not take offence ЁЯШК"

All male and females of this country are brought up with a background mindset of superiority of male over females and thereby all adult males become dominant over females and all adult females become submissive over males in all respect. Opposite of this always criticized by the society. In some other countries true feminism may thrive, but not at all in a country like India. Because, in those countries, society always prefers the logic and system supports everything that have logical value without being selfish. But in a country like India society had been never ready to leave their tradition or culture either right or wrong and in contrast with other modern thinking countries, Indian system always encouraging to maintain the chore & chore traditions, whatever right or wrong, and effort is still continuing. So, Indian system never let one bad custom of the society to become oblivion. They will never make any rule to make a reform like other modern countries. So, equal rights to a women / girl is too far, it's time to save some household women / girl victims from frequent incidents of atrocity against women / girl that have been occuring specially in states like UP, MP, Rajasthan etc. of India. No system or society present their  is going to take action to end these things and in fact they have been supporting these things to continue forever."

I have always been a feminist but I do not align with the western narrative of feminism. Western feminists only speak up when white women are getting opressed and never when WOC are supressed or killed.

A very inconclusive video....feminisim idea was right when it was started but now the definition of feminism has entirely changed and its become toxic feminisim
"No offence, Look at how Degenerate the West has become, broken society and a country, females in Only Fans which is considered as normalЁЯШВ, multiple partners sex, cheating, high divorce rate, high percentage of male alone and addicted to Porn, broken family, broken society, with time no good women or men to marry, population drop, bad mental health, leading to economic drop,
Super woke culture, every word and sentence will be an issue, the list goes on and on.
Literally all these woke, toxic feminism and blindly following the west just coz they are cool or whatever is a fool.
Imagine the centuries of social norms that worked and is still working, now the 10 years woke culture of the west is changing and challenging all the social norms of centuries we had.
Think for just a minute and understand what impact it will have on society and country."

As a guy, who is a SRK fan, so ofc I have a great respect for womanhood and I love them, I thank u for bringing the truth about feminism 
Toxic feminism or the тАЬfalse feminismтАЭ which is basically a practice of matriarchy in name of feminism is wrong

But feminism isnтАЩt
Every genuine human being, be it a man or a woman is a feminist
Ur personal experience with people might be different but in general u should keep believing in feminism
ItтАЩs not a female word, itтАЩs just a word
Just like we call God тАЬHeтАЭ, Humans тАЬhimтАЭ, we call male-female equality тАЬfeminismтАЭ, cuz it sounds the best.
ItтАЩs not discrimination,itтАЩs just what sounds the best, so as God,Human is for everyone, feminism is for everyone as well."

"But dhruv what do you think the police will believe in this case? 

Scene 1 : a girl has filled FIR that I have hit her.

scene 2 : I tell the police the girl is lying and just trying to have personal propaganda. 

Tell me everyone here including ladies, 99% all of you will think the girl is telling the truth? 
Then why am I the man given equal chance to defend or share my story? 

That is where the equal rights are going above man rights in some cases of India now.

"Didn't he claim in one his old videos that ""if feminism is really about equality, then it shouldn't be called feminism"". 
He's a feminist in the most bourgeois sense. His research is literally so watered down. 

The fact he didn't even address the issue of sexuality and its subversion by the patriarchy and the effect of caste on gender power structure, shows how shallow his reasearch is. He doesn't even know about prominent Indian feminist academicians and scholars. This shows how little he actually knows about feminism. 

His research seems to be completely drawn from popular YouTube video one would get when one types ""feminism"". Seriously Dhruv, if you want to talk about feminism bring actual experts and interview them, and stop ranting like a real life version of Bandya from Chup Chup Ke ""mujhe sab pata hai"".
It is so easy for him to actually research a topic properly, and then make a video. He certainly has the means of producing a good video. It is dangerous to see that people think this is a ""good"" video. What has happened to our society? Have we all stopped reading? Or if and when we read its only self help crap like ""Atomic Habits""? 

But, atleast he's using his platform for something good. He should definitely be parised for him in a time when most YouTube creators are literally feet-licking the government."

"agree and disagree, Feminism is a political philosophy and ideology, and women's rights is a concept which feminism doesn't have a monopoly on , so you can embody women's rights in a variety of different ways. Anything that is feminism doesn't mean it must be women's rights.
We or I should say I unequivocally believe in women's rights and without any problem.
Equal rights in social, political, and economic.
Men and women are equal in dignity but not identical. For certain thing women are best and for certain thing men are best.
And I believe men should control their emotions as you said opposite of it, cuz emotional men are dangerous to himself, his family and society as they are more tend to do violence or any other stupid things. 
And one more thing I am not alpha, beta, gamma of internet,  just a man believe in a God who has fair-minded approach."

But Agenda of feminism and equality can never be achieved since biology always override the progressive leftist thinking whether people like it or not because it doesn't matter how much progressive man or women become their biological desires, wants and needs are not going to change and American society including western society in general is a perfect example of that which you can see in real time right now."

"bruh i support that no one is the same like not all girls are the same and not all men are the same there are some bad people and there are some good people . now its ur choice to pick the right ones and not bad ones. plus y are u wasting ur energy by fighting the wrong ones

quick fact: hinduism is not a patriarchic religion. we have very powerful female goddesses as well and nice. we tell everyone to respect each other. and it doesnt matter which gender, race or caste they are. you give them respect and love and they give you love and respect which is known as karma. we also say that the wife and mothers name is recited first. 
for example: sita-ram, radhe krishna , shakti shiv
for example: sita putra luv-kush
now there are some argues that women are emotionally more expressable and strong where the men are more rational. 
my thoughts are that the above arguements are somewhere correct but not perfectly correct. there is a line between feminism and toxic feminism. so think about it and stay within the lines"

"What does Quran says 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

тАЬWhoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e., Paradise in the Hereafter).тАЭ [Al-Nahl 16:97]

тАЬSo their Lord accepted of them (their supplication and answered them), Never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female. You are (members) one of another, so those who emigrated and were driven out from their homes, and suffered harm in My Cause, and who fought, and were killed (in My Cause), verily, I will expiate from them their evil deeds and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise); a reward from Allah, and with Allah is the best of rewardsтАЭ [Aal тАШImraan 3:195]

тАЬVerily, the Muslims (those who submit to Allah in Islam) men and women, the believers men and women (who believe in Islamic Monotheism), the men and the women who are obedient (to Allah), the men and women who are truthful (in their speech and deeds), the men and the women who are patient (in performing all the duties which Allah has ordered and in abstaining from all that Allah has forbidden), the men and the women who are humble (before their Lord -- Allah), the men and the women who give Sadaqaat (i.e. Zakaah and alms, charity ), the men and the women who observe Sawm (fast) (the obligatory fasting during the month of Ramadaan, and the optional Nawafil fasting), the men and the women who guard their chastity (from illegal sexual acts) and the men and the women who remember Allah much with their hearts and tongues. Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise)тАЭ [Al-Ahzaab 33:35]

The reward is same for men and women."
"With regard to the changes in these rights throughout the ages, the basic principles have not changed, but with regard to the application of these principles, there can be no doubt that during the golden age of Islam, the Muslims applied the shariтАЩah (Islamic law) of their Lord more, and the rulings of this shariтАЩah include honoring oneтАЩs mother and treating oneтАЩs wife, daughter, sister and women in general in a kind manner. The weaker religious commitment grew, the more these rights were neglected, but until the Day of Resurrection there will continue to be a group who adheres to their religion and applies the shariтАЩah (laws) of their Lord. These are the people who honor women the most and grant them their rights. 

Despite the weakness of religious commitment among many Muslims nowadays, women still enjoy a high status, whether as daughters, wives or sisters, whilst we acknowledge that there are shortcomings, wrongdoing and neglect of womenтАЩs rights among some people, but each one will be answerable for himself.

And Allah knows best."
"There is no need for us to mention the situation of women in Greek, Persian or Jewish society, but even Christian societies had a bad attitude towards women. The theologians even gathered at the Council of Macon to discuss whether a woman was merely a body or a body with a soul. They thought it most likely that women did not have a soul that could be saved, and they made an exception only in the case of Mary (Maryam тАУ peace be upon her). 

The French held a conference in 586 CE to discuss whether women had souls or not, and if they had souls, were these souls animal or human? In the end, they decided that they were human! But they were created to serve men only. 

During the time of Henry VIII, the English Parliament issued a decree forbidding women to read the New Testament because they were regarded as impure. 

Until 1805, English law allowed a man to sell his wife, and set a wifeтАЩs price at six pennies. 

In the modern age, women were kicked out of the house at the age of eighteen so that they could start working to earn a bite to eat. If a woman wanted to stay in the house, she had to pay her parents rent for her room and pay for her food and laundry. 

How can we compare this to Islam which enjoins honoring and kind treatment of women, and spending on them?"
"And Islam honors women as daughters, and encourages us to raise them well and educate them. Islam states that raising daughters will bring a great reward. For example, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: тАЬWhoever takes care of two girls until they reach adulthood, he and I will come like this on the Day of Resurrection,тАЭ and he held his fingers together. (Narrated by Muslim, 2631) 

Ibn Majah (3669) narrated that тАШUqbah ibn тАШAmir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: тАЬWhoever has three daughters and is patient towards them, and feeds them, gives them to drink and clothes them from his riches, they will be a shield for him from the Fire on the Day of Resurrection.тАЭ (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah)"
"Islam states that the best of the Muslim men is the one who treats his wife in the best manner, and the man is forbidden to take his wifeтАЩs money without her consent. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

тАЬand live with them honorablyтАЭ [al-Nisa 4:19] 

тАЬAnd they (women) have rights similar (to those of their husbands) over them to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-WiseтАЭ [al-Baqarah 2:228]

And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: тАЬI urge you to treat women well.тАЭ (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 331; Muslim, 1468) 

And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: тАЬThe best of you is the one who is best to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.тАЭ (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3895; Ibn Majah, 1977; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi)"

The video discusses the concepts of feminism and patriarchy, emphasizing that feminism aims for political, economic, and social equality between men and women.

It clarifies that feminism does not seek to give women more power than men but strives for equal rights and opportunities.

The video also highlights how patriarchal thinking impacts both men and women, leading to issues such as men's loneliness, pressure to conform to traditional gender roles, and the suppression of emotions.

It addresses the historical context of feminism and its waves, emphasizing the importance of smashing patriarchy for the benefit of both men and women.

The video also critiques the misrepresentation of feminism in certain films and social media, highlighting the need to focus on real feminist issues rather than misconceptions and stereotypes."

But, when they gets cornered in an argument they use the traditional and actual definition (which is also used by you in this video) and kinda play a victim. I don't support any theory that considers a particular group of people superior based on their gender. Anyways, if you don't have any agenda to promote any kind of toxicity, just admit that the word 'feminism' is no longer defined in the correct way by most of the so called 'feminists'. If you can't do so then you're just full ЁЯТй."

Also talk about those negatives of feminism that have started much before. The ways of protesting how it's turned vulgar how they actually end up hating all men and don't follow actual feminism. Feminism term has been destroyed by the self proclaimed feminists themselves

U r just class apart. U r truly a standard!!!
So Islam is patriarchy according to explanation give by Dhruv rathee.
"People say its thier feminism bcoz those feminsit shoukd have condemend where the girl hit that boy bit they didnt why?? Also same is not the casr if its other way as most men,society and media at karge would have made a big issue if its a boy hitting girl like that on road ...so this is the irony here ....bcoz they want to create a matriachal society not equal society so are the laws and courts in india ....nothing to protect men when people file false cases to extort money ...are you supporting this???"
Also no feminist women would marry a person who doesnt work and who is actually lower than her finacially leave lower they wont marry an equal either so we can stop blabbering about feminisim as women they themsleves dont follow feminism so what the point about equality here ??
More men commit suicide bcoz of women in india jusy check the very own NCRB data you mentioned but you clearly sidelined main issue here
"Males dint have tendency to be voilent but they are built physically in such a way that theu have to do more muscular work or physical activity as they are build like that but current generation making men like women they should be allowed to play more its just how god made us ....if they dont play they dont feel good sbout themselves their growth gets diminished ,they dont have dopamine so tgey feel more streesed these are scientific facts ...jusy check it if you dont believe me"
You are wrong boys do share their hardships with friends but they dont get emitional about it ...may be few get emotional but not majority and all men dont feel shy to share with friends

"Would like you to comment on the gender bias Laws The Government Makes. 
Men have no hatred , for women, it is The Government having Bias towards A Specific Gender while Making Laws. Is what have caused all this thing. 

Honestly I prefer using The Word EQUALITY  more than feminism 

If Feminsism talks about Equality , then Why do we Use the Prefix Fem for the specific word??? 


So to avoid Any Bullshit , we would Like to Stick the word EQUALITY,  more than Feminism.  Which Gives More Preference to Women than Men, nowdays, as Such mentality has been engraved in the minds of people, the laws made by the government is a clear Indication of that."

"Unfortunately, the same thing happens to women too ... To not discuss their mental pain, because patriarchy thinks mental health is a taboo."
"Men and women are essentially equal, they should be always treated equally whether at home, workplace etc. Men should not dominate women, but a patriarchal society is needed. We need strong men and the head of the family should be a father. Most often issues and problems can be solved only by men. It's often men who take the initiative to do things. And they don't realise their power. For example, suppose you see a couple kissing in public in India, a woman probably will not be able to say anything against them. But men can. They are the ones that can fights animals( eg: like a snake or even cockroach ЁЯШБ) . It's true that men shouldn't show emotions. A man who shows emotions is seen as unstable and he tends to do unstable things. Women act on their emotions while men think logically. But I do think men should have someone to confide in like their parents or God. And men fighting with eachother is  alright, if it is for women for their dignity. Otherwise they(men& women) should really learn the saying of Buddha ""He gave me abuses, I didn't take them. So the abuses remained with him"""

"Actually He was school-time friend in Haryana. Politics was never his aim. Never.

He belonged to a very rich family. His father was a business man. I mean he is one. To be precise, he was related to construction business which was prospering like, damn !

You might be knowing that BJP Government is steadily bringing reforms in such sectors, several that type businessmen have suffered-are suffering under new policies. Since earlier there was almost no accountability and illegal things were common . Now all things are getting regulated, ESPECIALLY THE REAL ESTATE ONES. EARLIER IT WAS REGULAR FOR SUCH TYPE OF PROFFESSIONALS TO BREAK NORMS.

Since many of you might be left-adhering people, I know you will call me a BJP supporter, Bhakt and all sorts of names, but I need to admit-

Accountability has increased drastically under the Modi Government, in all sectors- I mean it.

This doesnтАЩt mean I am their supporter. I am highly critical of their economic policies, and many other things. But they have shown outstanding performances in many sectors.

Corruption is one such sector.

Anyways, coming to Rathe issue, know that his fatherтАЩs businesses were severly affected by the entry of the new government.

Illegal things became rare, I mean in many places, not all. But many. Rules and regulations need to be followed now and you canтАЩt fool the government. ThatтАЩs a fact.

HIS FATHERS BUSINESS GOT AFFECTED TO CORE.

Demonetization further curbed the black money of thousands. In IndiaтАЩs enemy nation(s), billions of dollars now became mere paper.

Yes, the common civilians suffered to a large extent but the heavy positives, no one highlights.

GST too is one such program which has sucked the hell out of these type

of people.

Just look at his earlier videos. His style is completely like тАШтАЩa child hating the class monitorтАЩтАЩ.

Just have a look at his earlier videos.

Even I was affected by the new policies of the modi government. A big part of my own house was brought down by machines. Although it was my fault, since we had encroached upon public land.

I personally observed many of my nieghbours who too were affected similiarly, they became devastatingly critical of BJP.

Maybe its justified, maybe its not. I wonтАЩt judge. But this is simply what I observed.

Dhruv knows that if BJP comes down, all those pre-2014 norms will again become common."

"Pink Ek Maha Propaganda Film Hai.

It Took Me Years To Understand That.

It Said, A Female Can Clearly Opt Out From The Deal After Taking Token Money. Because It's Her Right To Deny Accountability.

The Problem Is, Jab Khud Ke Ghar Mein Aag Lagti Hai Tab Pata Chalta Hai Aag Kya Cheez Hai Aur Usko Restrict Kyun Rakha Jaata Hai.

Sad But Yahi Fact Hai. 

And Politics Ya Propaganda, Power Or Rights Given Ke Dynamics Ka Bandarbaant JaanBujh Ke Kiya Jaata Hai Ta Ke Samaaj Mein Kalesh Ho Aur Politicians Faayda Utha Sake.

Women Are Emotional Decision Makers By Nature And Prone To Manipulation. 

Isiliye Unko Pataya Jaata Hai. Emotional Level Par. 

Business Houses Do The Same By Giving Them Discounts.

Even Seeta Ji Was Manipulated By Gold Deer Despite Of The Wise Ram Ji & Laxman.

Koi Bhi Insaan Ek KTM Aur DSLR Se Town Ke 70% Ladki Le Ja Sakta Hai. If It's Okay Then Jo Sahi Lagta Hai Karo. ЁЯСН

And Sadly, Samaaj Mein 80% Log Chhapri Hi Hote Hain. IQ Below 75.

And You're Speaking Of Females Like Kalpana Chawla, Laxmi Bai Or Malala Yousafzai."

"Four more shots and others films as such aren't about feminism, they just mislead the societal women into shit, these types of series are just for normalizing the 'slut-culture' for females. And then after the characters are done whoring around, they say a thing or two to men and call it a day. 

They don't support gender equality-""FEMINISM! FEMALE RIGHTS! MALE RIGHTS!""
They just follow the western dis-culture and attract audiences of 12-24 brainwashing them. 

Four types of feminism- liberal feminism, Marxist feminism, socialist feminism, and radical feminism...these types of series promote none of them is none of them.

Feminists like Florence Nightangle, Christine de Pizan, Mary Wollstonecraft, etc never promoted the feminism these shows want to show us. 

Feminism doesn't mean- ""HEY YOU'RE THE MAN, YOU DO THE HOUSE-WORK! I WON'T COOK FOR YOU! I WON'T FEED YOUR KIDS! I'LL GO TO PARTIES AND SLEEP WITH RANDOM PEOPLE! I'M A QUEEN!""

It means- ""I'll go to work too""  ""I'll be home by 7""   ""I'll do the dishes you do the clothes""   ""I earned this much today!""   ""Wow! Son, you got 100? I'll take you to McD with my own salary!"" ""We're both humans""  ""Dad I won the first prize in the race!""

Feminism- stands for equal rights for both men and women...Sadly, teens and dank-memer shits don't know the meaning and mis-lead the society.

Ofc, physically and emotionally they can't be the same, God gave boobs to women and a dick to man, they're different...They shouldn't run in the same race, but they should have a separate race where both run, not only one.

As a women, i just wanna be out of the party....Not taking sides of the male gender or the female gender but of an individual person.
Gender doesn't define you as a person, your character does...

If you're a shit man, you'll be shit as a women... If you're a shit women, you'll be shit as a man. Conc- you're shit"

this is same as : wife's mother in aw behaved like an ass but wife is mad at her husband because he did not CONDEMN  his moms act rather he just kept silent (or DID NOT SHOW support TO  his mom).

But I don't understand that why you are saying there is no feminism in India. Women are equally paid for the same position in any organisation whether it is government or private. I am also a victim of this patriarchy thinking. But what the established women of this society are doing? have they become empathetic to me?? badsurat aurat ka shadi hona muskil hai lekin bekar mard ko kaun leta hai? ek mard aurat ko sahara na de to woh kharab hai par meri bhabi jaisi  swarthi established aurat jab apne se zyada yoggata hold karne wale mard ko bole' mujhe kya pata main kya karoon?', tab uss neech soch ke khilaf koi mu nahi uthathe balki mujhe duffer banane ke liye kya nahi karr rahe sab!!!

"Actually the true essence of feminism is more misunderstood by women than men of PRESENT ERA. Right to vote and equal opportunities (even more in form of reservation whether it's any kind of examination or public transport) are being enjoyed by them.
However, still when a man do something unethical, they copy. If someone denies them to do the same, they take it as the violation of their Right to Equality.
Today's woman wants to use the word 'Feminism' as the license of doing anything a man can do, even if it degards their own social standards."

Thank you for making this video. I feel feminism has become a toxic word because of a lack of awareness about this term. Most people learn the definition of feminism through so-called social media influencers who don't know the meaning of feminism or are immature in the first place.

Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women and tasked with supporting them financially. And righteous women are devoutly obedient and, when alone, protective of what Allah has entrusted them with.1 And if you sense ill-conduct from your women, advise them ╦╣first╦║, ╦╣if they persist,╦║ do not share their beds, ╦╣but if they still persist,╦║ then discipline them ╦╣gently╦║.2 But if they change their ways, do not be unjust to them. Surely Allah is Most High, All-Great."

"This video script explores the concepts of feminism and patriarchy, debunking misconceptions and highlighting the importance of gender equality. It addresses the impact of patriarchal thinking on both men and women and emphasizes the need for a society that values equal rights and opportunities for all.
Highlights
тАв	0:00-1:26 ЁЯОм The script introduces the topic and addresses the question of whether feminist films are bad for society.
тАв	1:27-4:10 ЁЯМН The definitions of feminism and patriarchy are explained, emphasizing the fight for equality rather than women having more power than men.
тАв	4:11-8:58 ЁЯЪ╗ The script discusses the division between patriarchal and feminist ideologies, the social conditioning that contributes to patriarchal views, and the role of media in perpetuating regressive stereotypes.
тАв	8:59-12:52 ЁЯСе The script explores historical examples of women opposing equal rights and the existence of patriarchal thinking among some women.
тАв	12:53-16:30 тЪЦ The impact of patriarchal thinking on men is discussed, highlighting issues such as unemployment pressure, height-related stereotypes, and the normalization of violence.
тАв	16:31-18:14 ЁЯШФ The script addresses menтАЩs loneliness as a consequence of patriarchal norms and societal expectations.
тАв	18:15-19:56 ЁЯСА The importance of challenging patriarchal thinking and promoting gender equality is emphasized, with examples of male celebrities who openly identify as feminists.
Key Insights
тАв	ЁЯТб The fight for gender equality is not a battle between men and women, but rather between patriarchal and feminist ideologies.
тАв	ЁЯТб Patriarchy is a social system where men have control over women, while feminism seeks political, economic, and social equality for all genders.
тАв	ЁЯТб Social conditioning plays a significant role in perpetuating patriarchal views, even among women.
тАв	ЁЯТб Media, including TV serials and films, often reinforce regressive stereotypes and ideals of an тАЬideal womanтАЭ that conform to patriarchal norms.
тАв	ЁЯТб Historical examples show that women have also opposed equal rights due to societal pressures and internalized patriarchal thinking.
тАв	ЁЯТб Patriarchal thinking negatively impacts men, including pressures related to employment, height, and societal expectations of aggression.
ЁЯТб Challenging patriarchal norms and promoting gender equality benefits both men and women, as evidenced by male celebrities who openly identify as feminists."

"Both males and females are treated equally and have equal opportunities, as indicated in the following Quranic verses:┬аSurah Al-Imran, verse 195, and Surah An-Nisa, verse 124. These Quranic verses demonstrate that Islam does not support discrimination or differentiation based on gender in the pursuit of achievements"
"Its not like all femists are fake, i love the video and it really taught me allot, but i had some points too.
1. Not all femists are saints. The feminist movement is in the gutter due to most of these people.
2. Its just not that female and male anatomy is different. There are several emotional and physical differences in both the genders.
3. Female uprising in on the skies and any opinion made against it, the person is cancelled.
We need to understand that there is toxic feminism and we also need to understand that the feminists of now dont really understand that they are equal and they need to stop fighting"
Toxic feminism is as bad as toxic masculinity.. men & women have separate roles & both should be treated fairly & equally. Tipping to either side of the balance scale is deleterious to human society..
"The Defintion of feminism doesn't matter it is a matriarchy by action even if it is not by definition. There is no need to divide us into teams to have common sense. Call it humanism if you want, feminism is a bad religion and most people in it are intolerant of others. If I wanted that I'd just join the BJP.

"@dhruvrathee. You have to study more about  this issue. Here you made to please both men and women.. See women should not have voting rights, why because they are not or aware or interested in politics. When they go for voting they ask someone else who should they vote for. Women not involved any war.
And natural thing is women always look for more in men than themselve, if women is educated or have high paid job so they look for more paid men than them. So high paid women likely remain single or get divorced easily. In west 90	%educated women initiate divorce. One more thing I will tell you, imagine if you are convicted for false murder case and you are in court, and judge is a women in her periods. Will you wish her to say your judgement on that day?   Can you do study how in Islam how they men and women are given power legally. Can you do a video on that. Because I heard that in court while give witness if women giving witness there should be two women, and when men give witness only one man is enough"

"I appreciate the video essay as it puts through the rational points without much fluff. I would like to add though, as what the film critics mentioned in the video talked about the 'feminist' movies, which I would wish to, by extension, expand on:
Back when I used to spend some time on my anonymous account on Twitter, I did realize there were quite a few people who basically were parodying feminism like how those 'alpha males' believe it is, while being serious too with their thoughts. And then there are also people who would just slap themselves the label of being a feminist, simply as a means to get validation (and maybe some internet romance) from other feminists, genuine or otherwise. This exactly makes me not want to identify myself as one, simply because of the self-anointing thing; like let the person's actions speak, not the person themselves. If someone else calls you one, consider it an honor, but not when you introduce yourself as one; that just adds more suspicion if one really is a feminist or just seeking validation while being irrational towards the situation.
Other than that, thank you for the video essay. I do hope it reaches more to people to really understand how they think with situations involving genders is absolutely wrong, on both ends of the spectrum. And I also wish that feminism gets its original meaning back and not be associated with matriarchy to the uninitiated, instead of them blazing guns at each other for who they are."

Read below comment. Feminism is not about etc etc. And do like it. Reality is while educating the feminism, reality is many people normal people are tagged as criminals by court. Thats feminism. Now let's support feminism, make rules without thinking anything because males in india are rapist and only good gender is female. Male is wrong. So to sum up kudos. Lets educate feminism to community while accepting feminist penal codes. Males are so stupid and they are not going to wake up because few of them did rape. ЁЯШЕ And if male suffer, we dnt come on the road to support him. We will blame him. On the other hand every woman will come to support a woman. Thats a difference.

"YouтАЩre trying to be a social constructionist, Dhruv. A lot of the menтАЩs rights issues are innate and have biological and evolutionary underpinnings. Men get into more physical fights because we are biologically nore agressive, this is not a patriarchal  oppression, itтАЩs biology.

Wanting a taller husband with more money? Well obviously , if you are going to be pregnant for 9 months and multiple  times, you would want some to be able to protect you, maybe not that much anymore, and provide for you in those years that you canтАЩt. This is not a patriarchal insistence, itтАЩs decided by the women because it's  what is best for them."

"I totally agree. One point however is related to equal pay for equal work. I agree 100% that people doing the same amount of work should be paid equally. Problem comes in defining what constitutes equal work. Take the example of tennis. Men's and Women's tennis are both equally popular. However, Men's tennis gets more revenue as they are longer. So what would equal pay for equal work mean for tennis. Or say something as simple as a software engineering. How is work defined? Is it hours put in? Lines of code? A lot of service sector jobs where output is not easily measured runs into this issue."

Feminists are practically seen as womens rights advocated only.

Now, do men enjoy any constitutional rights that women does not have? No.

Did any feminists support Neha Dhupia? No.
But the question is also did any feminist deplore Neha Dhupia? The answer to that is also a no to my knowledge. 

The same thing on the Lucknow case. No feminists came to support the boy.

The same feminists, cite the reason of family pressure and leave early from the work,┬а but also cringes when the hard working man is given a raise or promotion.

So, i would prefer to be a faminist..."

"Well book definition of feminism and actual feminism on ground are different. ItтАЩs naive to say feminism hasnтАЩt changed from its original goals. Feminism is not driven by a small set of intellectuals today as itтАЩs no more a new idea but by society. Currently it looks like a womenтАЩs advocacy movement. I am not saying feminism shouldnтАЩt exist but it should be called out and shamed when deviating from its original goals which is тАЬwomen and men should have equal opportunities in economic, political, and social lifeтАЭ


People now go for equality of outcome than equality of opportunity. When Alia Bhat in Gully Boy picks up a bottle and hits a women no one has a problem but when a guy slaps a girl in Kabir sing or thappad suddenly itтАЩs so toxic.

"@dhruvrathee All the comments made by famous people who you mentioned to be feminists was in the years 2015, 2016 and 2017.  I understand that you made mention of those famous people's comments after giving you definition of feminism but most people would just gloss over it and thus i have to make view of some of my points.

The definition of feminism has changed over the years by the upcoming generations. The current definition of feminism is to have more rights then men, is if women don't succeed to make it the fault of men, is if men bring out their problems then to imply we don't understand women, is if a wrong deed is pointed out by a man to tag him  as a person who doesn't believe men and women are equal, and a lot more than cannot be listed here. While many of these people you mentioned do believe in feminism they believe in the women having rights to education, opportunities and so on. 

It is true that there was no right to education before to almost all women but that has changed now and women do have the right to education, they even have reservation but let us not talk about that for now. The women who don't have a right to education come from rural households. In most of these households the men are uneducated too. The problem there is the lack of awareness provided by the government among other institutions. But the CURRENT FEMINISTS would blame it on the patriarchy and what not instead of the main concern that is awareness

Almost women these days have opportunities these days equal to men or sometimes more than men. Again the women who do not have opportunities are from rural sectors of the country who are not aware of what opportunities are out there in the country. It is also of the strict traditions of these rural families that have yet to be broken due to the conservative nature of us Indians.

If we speak about crime equality then while there are so many rapes on females taking place around the country there are a negligible number on men as well. NOW by stating this i am not saying i don't understand what women go through or that i condone anything related to women being tormented but men not being tormented. ALL i am stating is that WE are aware of women getting raped but unaware of men getting raped. If a rape case is made/complained to the police station it is a law that the accused man is to be thrown in jail first before any investigation is conducted. And hence women make use of this to frame men for rape, assault and various other crimes. AGAIN, i am not stating that these crimes do not happen i am stating that the severity of these crimes are being taken advantage of by some women and being used against men.

ALL in all, my point being that the definition of feminism has changed over the years by the general public. The video was basically of the past of feminism but not of the current feminism. Kindly bring into the light all of the current feminism issues and problems.
Thank You!"

"Not only pregnancy when we talk about strength than man again dominate.  However, the conversation While promoting equality in terms of rights and opportunities is crucial, fostering clashes between men and women isn't desirable. Some argue if we wanna test equality so  arrange matches or contests between men and women in sports like WWE etc , & it's rare to see a country with a 100% female army, many nations have predominantly male armies.

 We often compare men and women in education and other professions, but not in sports. It's important to recognize that true feminism lies in acknowledging the value of women and treating them with equal respect and rights not in terms of strength and not also toxic feminist both are condemnable.

My view is Promoting respect and providing space for both males and females is crucial. Unfortunately, in today's society, there is some hate spreading between both sides due to certain psychological factors affecting both men and women & causing damaging our social & cultural values . Encouraging understanding, empathy & cooperation can help mitigate these tensions & foster a more harmonious environment where both genders are valued and respected"

"The world is divided into 2 kinds of men
Men who are achievers,have careers,jobs etc and obviously woman 
Others are having no career therefore no wife,no family.
In return they turned themselves as sigma male and started misogyny,insteat of seeing their own faylt,they blame women who are more achievers than them and also those men whom these women select."
"I appreciate your insights on feminism and equal rights in your video. While advocating for equal rights is crucial, it's equally important to address how feminism can be misused to pressure women into conforming to stereotypical male traits, which has created another type of social conformity problem.

Your video emphasizes the need for equal rights, and you have highlighted some examples of misconception about feminism but it overlooks the risk of misuse that can encourage women to emulate male characteristics, including those that are detrimental not only to women but those are detrimental even to men for men having them in the first place - such as irrational aggression and exerting irrational dominance тАУ damaging the natural dynamics between genders. This is just one of the causes of the increased divorce rate; both genders are gradually becoming unwilling to marry, leading to an increase in loneliness. David Deida's 'The Way of the Superior Man' supports this perspective, emphasizing the unique energies of both genders and the disruption caused by losing core energy.

The video should also explore how feminism has become a tool to manipulate women, devaluing activities associated with femininity. This bias, perpetuated by societal pressure, not only affects women but also reinforces the notion that only certain paths, like pursuing a career, hold value. The examples of women being astronauts, scientists, etc., are more highlighted, traditionally male-dominated roles. However, a woman who may willingly want to stay at home or pursue feminine activities feels the pressure of this new social conformity to pursue such male-dominated career paths; only then would she be considered a part of this new phenomenon. This coerced conformity can result in dissatisfaction and a loss of authenticity as individuals pursue paths incongruent with their true desires.

In conclusion, while advocating for equal rights, I request that you make a video addressing the inadvertent consequences of misusing feminism. Promoting a nuanced understanding can create a society that embraces the diversity of choices available to both men and women"

"Druvrathee how would you make sense when you will justify the fack feminism by the theory of real feminism... 

Feminism of the theory doesn't exist on the ground if it does then that too just on a very small level...

And fack feminism is only what Mostly exist on the ground which must go in both your's and mine openion...

Then when we reject feminism then it's very obvious we are rejecting fack feminism because that only exist the most on the ground not the real one...

The theory of feminism may be correct on it's way but how  the propaganda running in the name of feminism is correct ..."
"Sorry but some people says right you are really a manipulative man.
1) You didn't mention fake rape, domestic violence and dowry case.
2) You didn't mention about any laws which are made for men because there are none.
3) Even an educated and well earning girl will not marry a man earning low than her(exception are exception).
4) There is a video where a person asked question from a group of girl ""will you date a unemployed man or not"" and only one girl said yes while other said no, and all of them were in modern outfit and well educated.
5) If both husband and wife are earning and wife lose her job or thought to do something else she will not face any problem, and when men will go through the same there is a good chance that his wife will leave him.
6) Men are always traditional whether they marry housewife or working women, but women are only traditional when she is housewife, those men will still protect feminist wife and do their traditional part, think yourselves will any woman marry a man who do not come to pick her up at 10-11 pm, will she marry a man who do not protect her??


The main problem is women are only following feminism in terms of education and earning, nothing else, no woman will marry a man who can not protect her and provide her, FULL STOP."

1. women are generally and largely physically weaker than men.
2. Women are not suitable for wars. Only men should be allowed to go to the frontline in a war.
3. Generally men choose stem fields more than women do.
4. Men and women sports should always be seperate. otherwise women teams won't be able to win. even in games like chess men and women should have seperate events.
5. I agree on equal rights thing. but saying that women can do whatever men are doing that is a lie. a big lie. 
6. Women are different. but equal. there is no denying that women and men are different. but we should give equal rights to all."

"Men do hard physical labour
Men have to earn as a responsibility
Men cannot be househusband by choice.
Men can physically fight
Men are emotionally stronger

Women produce generations
Women raise children.
Women built society
Women teach better
Women are more creative.
Women are emotionally weak.

Both genders not just physically differ but their brains differ as well. This in patriarchy but accepting the reality of nature. Otherwise abolish the rule of ""Women and Children First"". These sorts of opinions may appear cool but lack rational grounds. Though some of the areas can be worked upon for improvement, still equating both genders to absolute would be injustice with nature."

There is a dark site also in marriages, marriage me divorce me wife ko husband ka kuch %age wealth milata he, society ka support jyada milata he, females ke liye laws jyada he (I don't understand men's law, gender laws kyun nahi banaye gye he in reality). Misuse and abuse of laws for monetary purpose or cheating by women, adultery inke cases ko prove krna mushkil he, ladaki Dahej ka yah koi allegation lagakr bach skti he. Ek case me internet pr suna tha ki ek husband jis bachhe ko paal rha, voh spouse ka DNA test krakr check nahi kr skta ki uski wife ne cheat kra, ki bacha uska hi he yah kisi aur ka. Khulla cheating ka scope and loopholes and misuse ke cases dikhatey by females on Internet. Just view the video ""Martyres of Marriage"" video. Iska jawab kon dega??"
"Hey Dhruv, you are defenitly driven by WEF ideology that you are unnoticed to get corrected. See! If you could see the current US is getting more into LGBTQ++ ideology! If you want to compare then choose feminism vs inequality or sensitivity vs masculinity or Patriarchy vs Matriarchy. You are comparing wrongly with feminism vs Patriarchy. Hereafter there is WEF elites are not want us to think of it as feminism vs something, brace for the real impact it should be ""Family vs LGBTQ+"" ideology. Forget about outdated topic, men already doomed with the shit ideology and became weak, who will speak against the weakening of family syystem? And one more thing you never explicitly spoke about how the movies from 1980's are turning to push the LUST and making the men weaker and deprived, I suggest don't listen from toxic feminists."
"If feminism is all about equality then why males have to do all the dirty and dangerious works. In the present Ukrain-Russia war, men are dying in thousands like KFC chickens while their wives and daughters are parting all night in clubs in Europe and Thailand with compensation money of dead husbands and sons.  Instead of the word feminism, we need to use the word equality. The so-called modern feminism is all about male bashing and discouraging women to remain single. These feminists are actually big time scammers of the 21st century."
"All men are not Just, all men are not True.
Patriarchy is not wrong, wrong use of it is, just as religion is never the problem, it is those who use it to gain power.
Awareness on equity over equality, empowering those oppressed, Blessing & Curse factors need to taught & spread.
Men are men (Deceptive feminism & equality are destroying it),
Women are women (Exploitative tactics masquerading as freedom are ruining them), Third gender shall be third gender(Abuse, a detriment to society).
This is a world of compensation."

"The kind of influence of patriarchy is still a big topic coz every one of us is struggling against this. It's not against womens but also against mens as well.. but at the same time womens who are fighting against patriarchy are also not wanting feminism in true sense.. I mean how many womens who are self dependent are actually marrying a guy who have the paying job less that her??? Very less right.. but you will not see any women will raise voice against it.. means indirectly they wanted to use patriarchy as a means to get benefitted for their feminism character... Also when you see around nowadays womens are embracing those relationships which has toxicity factors  which is also accessory to patriarchal behaviour and the big thing is they actually wanted such relationships..
The main problem of having feminism for womens are they treat it like pseudo feminism.. it develops in them ""I don't need a man"" kind of attitude or need a man who will have high paying jobs... I mean how they are calling themselves as self dependent womens if they wholly or partly rely on finances of your partner???

In simple sense, patriarchy will never gets over bcz both of genders are using it for their benefits to support their choices."

"We should talk about Individual rights ONLY, rather than simplifying it to a gender, every gender has their problems"
"To be fair to history, the feminist movement seems to have misappropriated or have been forced to use the word ""FEMIN-ism"" as a name for the obvious natural right to equality of all genders and sexes. If it was called egalitarianism or simply ""equalism"" instead of femin-ism, it would not get so badly misunderstood, misused and decried by the patriarchy.
When feminism means equalism, why not use the correct word, i.e. equalism?
This pre-emptive move to cover everything under the name ""feminism"" probably has (I am guessing here) an interesting set of historical anecdotes or events, in order to protect or optimise the feldgling women's rights and women's liberation movements. But the lasting damage done by this misnomenclature is that feminism finds it hard to break into patriarchal mindsets merely due to the name. The name has become a burden, not an advantage.
As a software developer, I can say with a lot of experience, name your variables, functions and classes correctly, lest some other programmer make a mess of the system by using your code wrongly due to the wrong name.
Note that I am not commenting about anything else than the unfortunate or opportunistic mistake in nomenclature.
Everything else is fine. Baki sab theek hai, sahi hai.
Just to be clear, we must acknowledge the fact that female cats, dogs and rats don't have to listen to the orders of male cats, dogs and rats. Nature has a lot of equality of rights and also a lot of inherent freedoms, which human society denies to both men and women. Some for good reasons, but many for the wrong reasons (vested interests of a sub group)."

"Things are changing now, by women empowerment, feminism, equal rights and freedom. Many womens use these things as a weapon to suppress mens. I think after some decades there will be matriarchal society to some extent. Majority of peoples have sympathy with a female be it society, office or a courtroom. Day by day things are shifting to other end, extreme of everything is toxic to society. There should be balance in everything for males and females."

"It is not about patriarchal mindset vs feminist mindset, it is more about to let the person do whatever  he wants to (Freedom to live life in the way they want). If a women wants to work, achieve something great let her do that and treat her equal with the males doing the same work. On the other hand if a women wants to sit at home and don't want to work let her, it's not because of patriarchal thinking or lack of freedom.
Same should be allowed to males also. Just imagine if a man wants to sit at home and her wife works for their livelihood, seems impossible."

The truth is that everyone want to relax in life, don't want to work hard. And females have that choice, to just get married to a men who earns well and she can just sit at home and enjoy.
Only few womens want to achieve something in life, work hard. And others choose to relax, eventually develop patriarchal thinking."

Very aptly identified issue
"Feminism is about equality where it benefits women and special treatment where they like... free stuff, chivalry and what not is supported and equal pay even when they do not bring in equal money, that's what feminism is in 21st century. No need to justify it. It is male bashing and it is about creating an evil picture of everything male. 
Misandry is socially acceptable and male issues are invalidated and ignored, meanwhile news and media highlights women issues like nothing. Unfortunately saying good things about women even if by talking shit about men.... makes you look good in society.

Men do not have an important right, right to be a victim... and yes modern radical feminism being spread in every part of society is to be blamed if not completely, significantly"

Feminism has been corrupted over the years and now feminism has converted to Women Supremacy movement. There is literally no such rights in today's society that men have, that women do not have. Feminism is no longer needed in today's world. If we still need a movement then it should be a gender equality movement rather that a movement just for women."

To woman engaged and married. Woman are befriended, by woman is the civilization continued. When woman dies, woman is sought for. It is by woman that the entire social order is maintained. Then why call her bad? From her Kings are born тАУ SGGS , p.473.. 
Guru Nanak Ji said рдкрд╡рди рдЧреБрд░реБ рдкрд╛рдиреА рдкрд┐рддрд╛ рдорд╛рддрд╛ рдзрд░рдд рдорд╣рдд :meaning Air is Guru, Water is father, land is mother, respect them conserve them,without them nothing survives. He said this in 15th century when there was no pollution. He is the first person to promote equality to every human being rejecting Caste system, promoted HUMAN RIGHTS (when at that time there was no such word as human rights, other living beings' rights, believed in feeding the needy and rejected superstions. He started LANGER pratha which mandated that irrespective of the person's caste or rich poor or male female etc, everyone get free food at equal place without any kind of discrimination. whether he is king or beggar or from any of the so called caste.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji said ""Dharti pare hor pare hor"" meaning there are many countless earths, another earth on the far side of the other. He said this when there were no development in sciene, and the world believed there is only this earth where life exists and it is the centre of the whole universe.

Majority of scientists, soldiers, construction workers, sanitation workers, firefighters, engineers, health workers are all men. This world needs patriarchy coz no matter what there are gonna be violent and abusive men everywhere and they can only be controlled by other men. If providing for and protecting your woman is patriarchal then let it be becoz humans evolved due to patriarchy. So this smash the patriarchy thing is as ridiculous as it is delusional."

Islam not only  gives rights to women but also honour. e.g. Islam says paradise is under the feet of your Mother. Most people who are unaware of Islam think that Islam suppress women but in reality Islam gives women a perfect way of honourable life. You know my Father kiss me on my head and always become happy to hear my voice..... Why? Because Islam teach us to love our daughter. But Islam also teach us to cover yourself because pearls are always coveredтЭдтЭд

"Research work is required, in order to decrease the society problems. Work should be carried out by asking questions from both male and female then see the results where the path actually going either towards Good side or bad. You will know what is side effects of this path and that path then conclude the result simply... I will say men and women are not equal because they have different strength and weaknesses... A women can make many boyfriends whereas men can not. A women have difficulty to find someone real who provide real security whereas any type of men can provide real security to women... A women is beautiful when she have family, children. Otherwise single woman looks beautiful when she is under 30s. After then? A single women without family looks so bad... This is reality. In order to solve problem. Do research and generate your own laws or follow Islamic laws. Islam describe how to solve society problems without requiring research work. Because it is complete research where no one can find research gap."
"Man u r a big misandrist. Once again u have presented one side of the story as if women are the only gender who are suffering. When on earth will u present a balanced story. Women should have equal rights and in its theoretical definition feminism looks good too. But u need to look at the practical application of feminism. The way it has made life a living hell for a common male. No you will not talk about it. Just keep speaking as if we r living in a la la land where no woman is going to abuse the unequal powers given to women in the name of equality. This wrong application of ""feminism"" has completely rotten the west. The effects of which can be seen in their society now."

"Actually the problem is in the word itself, not the meaning and the movement. The word itself seems like one-sided when someone first hears about it. That's why some people can take advantage of it.

The real enemy are the people who want to make us separate for their own personal agenda."
He is the person who can prove wrong as right or 2+2 =5. Man and woman can be equal in terms of right but both are different by body and thoughts.

As a  Muslim I'll say Islam already give all necessary rights to women.

"Feminism is female communism. Earlier it was good, now it has long gone from betterment of women. It has become a tool for women to cope with their flaws. For example, their was a harmless meme that Emma Watson is looking so pretty without makeup also. A feminist woman got angry and said this is patriarchal, we all are beautiful. And modern fake feminism is actually not benifitting women. They stir peer pressure of modernity in women which in turn benefits cigarette companies, perverted men etcтАж"

"Toxic alpha misogynists are just male counterparts of toxic feminists. Both feel their gender is superior, both want special respect for their gender (eg, feminists donтАЩt wanna get accountable for their mistakes and some think of themselves as Goddesses and alphas want women to serve them).

Toxic feminist ab ladko ko misguide kar rahi hai aur ladke bewakoof ki tarah toxic Femisto ki sun rahe hai.
Men commission hona bohot jaruri hai
Feminism se ladko ko nukasan ho raha hai ladko fasaya ja raha hai exploitation ho raha hai ab vakt aagaya hai ki ladko ko bhi apne liye hak mangne chahiye aur khud ke protection ke liye law banana chahiye? Kyu ki bohot sari toxic female ab aajad ghum rahi hai. aur unke pass ladko ko barbad karne ka pura adhikar sarkar ne diya hai.
Even if a girl is worried a guy demands beautiful girl who will take care of him and family. So with the added pressure women after marriage tends to give up on her career. For financial security if she expects man to earn more what wrong?

"Sab ke pass ye khyamta hai ki wo apne aap ko strong dikhaen aur yahan baat insan ki ho rahi hai aur baat hai kya galat aur kya actual me sahi hai ,thappad marna galat hai chahe wo mard ho ya aurat we all should be feminist.Thik hai hamare pass hormones hai like testosterone aur ye ladkiyon ke pass bhi hai ye sach hai nature ne distinguish karne ke liye hume aisa banaya hai aur hum logon ne ise pura alag banadiya yes men can build more  muscles than female but ye toh nahi ki ladkiyon ko daba ke rakha jae"

Topic of this video is great.. Thanks for posting.
i am so greatful  that you made this video. everyone is born a feminist. no baby is born thinking the other sex is superior or inferior to them. it's the patriarchal society that teaches us otherwise. people have such a wrong def of feminism in their mind. they think women falsely accusing men of crime or taking advantage of them is feminism. but who told them that's feminism. like who?!

It may take time to get right partners and friends to listen to you but please don't hold back your thoughts and emotions. And always maintain a diary if you feel too much ...share your emotions on diary,write it down...as i girl i guarantee Diary is the best choice to talk to. ... I also feel little uncomfortable crying publicly or even with my girl friend in general.....and diary helps the best.

"You speaks very nicely... But please speak about other religions too... Why you can't quote quran even for once... Why you  can't utter a single word about muslim scholars who openly defame females... But you can quote garudpuran and a spokesperson of VHP. 

Think about it dhruv..."
"Feminism is right and we support that but towadays many women's are using it in a wrong way

Due to which women's who really need laws for their protection also get untrusted"
"This video by Dhruv Rathee challenges the idea that feminism is about men vs. women, instead arguing it's about smashing harmful gender roles that limit everyone. It explores how both men and women suffer under patriarchal expectations, and showcases real feminist heroes who fought for equality for all. Join the call to create a world where everyone can be their true selves, free from outdated norms and expectations."
"Allah (god,ishwar, bhagwan) jisne sochkar bolne wala dimag Diya insan ko.
Wo apni kitab me kehta hai.
Wife aur husband dono ek dusre ka libas (dress) hain.   Ab isko detail me sochkar bolo."

I  agree with you
Thankyou
23:37 completely agree with this point ЁЯТп I observed this too
"Let me kill his claims by facts 

1.Right to vote was given to men because every single men in a country is obligated to fight in a war if a country needs them most of the women protest against right to vote for women  

2 women already have more rights then men . Women can now accuse you of rape without any proof or any physical contact 

3. Scandinavian countries like finland , norway and sweden where feminism rules instead of 
Equalising  it leads to more division- jordron peterson 

3 indian marriages divorce rate - 2-3 %
Western society-almost 70 % 

Marriage is a duty / sacrifice and your moral obligation 

As feminists grew happiness with index for women went down every year 
 
4 its not social conditioning itтАЩs biological itтАЩs how we evolved its in out DNA   Women like tall men because back in evolution women need a men to protect and provide other wise other men will kill her child and rape her thatтАЩs why women will always live tall  strong men 

Men we  hate unfaithful women because back in evolution men canтАЩt ever know is the child his or someone else so men have evolved this way"

"Zyaada mard dhruv rathee jaise chakke hai aur ikkate nahi hai, isiliye women equality aur feminism jaise bhimaari humari samaj mein phele hue hai"
And should also tell that out of 2.5 % more that 2 percent ks because of feminist FALSE allegations of rape and domestic violence
But now modern feminism is not about equal rights its about only women privilege
"Problem starts when people(irrespective of gender) demand pseudo-feminism instead of feminism or people start identifying feminism as pseudo feminism or as you said toxic feminism. Feminism has lost it's meaning over the years and that's where the problem lies. This has been mentioned by you in the last part of the video thank you for making this.

Equality has been guaranteed by the constitution and our law but our society, sadly, is not yet mature enough to accept it whole heartedly.
This will not change since it will require more intervention by the government and if they do that they will lose votes."

An intelligent take
He really thinks we are dumb and blind and do not see the Twitter and incidents that happen now a days
I think feminism is becoming men hating. The false rap cases are also increasing...
"Let me be clear with my statement, I don't know a great number of self-proclaimed so called alpha male and masculinists disguised as chauvinists will get offended. But the fact is if you look at present day Indian Society, girls are more focused than overall boys in making their career and totally minding their own business, while most of the boys are busy in social media and getting distracted easily by toxic influences and thus being led by insecurity, they judge women and try to find negative potential from them and generalize the whole community. 
So, my message for those frustrated incels : Please, get a life!! And stop bashing and blaming FEMINISM as an act of retaliation for the welfare of yourselves and the whole. Thank youЁЯЩПЁЯП╝"

"Patriarchy log womens ko equal rights dene me darte h , kahi equal rights milne ke baad women unka harassment na karne lag jaaye. Baat h apne hisaab se kaam karwane ki. Men sochta h mere hisab se ho aur aurat sochti h mere hisab se ho. Agar equal rights de diye gaye to daar h women ke hisaab se chalna padega .

"Women and man can never be equal it's just not how nature made us if we go back to cave times, men used to hunt and feed the family which made them masculine where women had role to follow the motherhood and raise the child and that made them feminine. If women start to earn just as a man she have to force alot of masculine energy and she won't be recessive anymore in relationship and it's probably the worst thing. I think we both gender should follow their own roles and not go against the nature."

"Dhruv, I've been following you for the past 3-4 yrs, BUT, here, I disagree with you on some points related to patriarchy. 
You say men too should express their emotions (especially, crying) openly. But, no. If there's no shame for a man to cry openly, then do you think that will lead to strong men that the society needs? If a man who has got a whole family looking upon him cries, then how would the family stay emotionally strong? Just imagine, if a kid is seeing his father crying every other day, what strength will he impart in himself? In fact, I'd say women too should not become so emotionally expressive. ... 

Do you think a man (no doubt, physically tougher than a woman) is naturally destined to stay at home and lay on her wife's money? Does this fit the definition of a 'man'? 

I'm not completely in favour of patriarchy. There are bad things in it too. But, what i'm seeing is that in search of a balance, all these 'feminists' are in turn making men weak and too lenient which should not be the case. There should always be a bit of toughness in being a man and that's what leads to strong men and strong societies. All through the history."

"It all boils down to mentality. Granting women every right they deserve is crucial. It should be entirely up to women to decide what they want for themselves. I have many female friends who express a desire for a simpler life. They're not interested in pursuing careers or higher education; instead, they aspire to find happiness in marriage and family life. And that's completely valid. On the other hand, I also have friends who are passionate about achieving equality with men. They want to explore life, have fun, and pursue their dreams without limitations. Both choices are admirable and should be respected equally. It's about empowering women to make decisions that align with their desires and aspirations, whatever they may be."

if i want my beautiful wife work in office me and my friend type of male will eat her. i don't belive in love i belive in situation and reality. 

one of the female youtuber nikita thakur says, in india 60% of that women sleep with others.lot's of beautiful girl who had had children,husband even had love merrage, eaten by my friend. if i love my wife and don't want to lost her, i must protect her. i am bad, but i am not going to let her go and eaten by fox.

"The term ""aadmi"" has its etymological roots in Persian. It is derived from the Persian word ""adam"" (╪в╪п┘Е), which means ""man"" or ""human."" Over time, this term has been adopted and integrated into various languages, including Urdu and Hindi.

In Urdu and Hindi, ""aadmi"" is commonly used to refer to a human being, a person, or a man in the generic sense. It's a gender-neutral term, encompassing both men and women."

What I don't understand is what rights women of this era are talking about. What kind of rights women don't have that men have. If you guys expect that if a guy is getting X amount of salary then girl should also be earning same X amount which is the most illogical demand I've ever heard. Those jobs are NOT BASED ON GENDERS. Woman will get as much salary as man if she does the job as good as man. Companies even prefer women if there are two shortlisted candidates (male and female) with same skillset.
still some men are saying what patriarchy says but blaming it to feminism

"PatriarchyЁЯЧ┐, it is not a rule book created by your forefathers, it is an accepted way of living by masculine men and feminine women, but in today's world, men are becoming feminine and women are trying to be masculine that's why they hate patriarchy.

A Clever person never be against Feminism He/She is against the wrong mindset.
there shouldnt be different sports competetions for women and men they should be played against each other .
"Thuck this is non sensible because we all know how's our mindset about girls .
Girls will be have different schools and all different things.
Because of them we are distract
They don't dress well etc. that' it sorry if my English is bad but there will be separate rules for girls . In the world there is no equally important just like in India Mumbai local train also has a private girl section but in men there are not any section as girls . There is no permission to the men to get in girl section But girls can easily go everywhere. That's also not fair . Hence I am with feminism but not equality."
"I m following druv sir from 3 years and he really changed my thinking about society, economic, international politics etc"

"Some matriarchies societies exist  in some places in the world today and the men are healthy and super happy. But they need better moral female characters in film. It seems these feminists film is lesser of two evils. Because male films are more vile in violence in rape scenes, crime glory, gun fights, and zombie films over flow. Men can beat the mess out these feminists in these films of so called notorious women. It's really movies about whores as villians not real super hero or the good feminist types. I suppose Bollywood is trying to say if a woman wants power she has to be a whore. That is messed up. Men really do disrespect women because we feel they are second class to men and need to stay there. But what if they don't stay submitted is not a guarantee. It looks like change is happening honestly."

"Respect all human beings regardless of gender. That's it ! Every human being needs care because we are transient beings. Disease and calamity creates tragic one day. So, we should focus on mutual respect without looking at gender. I want everyone start thinking good about others and be calm. Life would become simple and less toxic. In all possibility, you cannot change attitudes of everyone in the world. Thinking better and looking at intellect than other's body or attire would lead to a more tolerant and respectful society.

"What you explained is natural behavior of human beings nothing to do with feminism & patriarchy.  Men are trained to be tough & Women to be nurturing.  We currently live in peaceful times and not many wars so making fun of men being tough is encouraged by bunch of soyboys & simps.  During WAR these kind of weak societies will be wiped out by another strong nation and tough times will reset everything back to natural order.
Nature gave men physical strength, speed, agility, mindset is the reason they command more power,   just like nature gave lion, tiger strength & speed and they command in the jungle not dear, buffalo or giraffe.  This is what GOD/Nature wanted and made it this way."

"Feminism is abt making both the genders equal like no gender shld be above another both women and men go through shit from society so we shld make them equal. We shldnt make women superior or men superior. Feminism is abt equality. It is abt social, economic etc equality."
"Men Were given Rights to Vote Before women ,because whenever there's a war They will be drafted for military, the voting came at price of life , that they have to die for there country, and what's the point in talking about history now both men and women have voting rights, And Your stating that its patriarchy And you talk about logic, you brought up the past to sound more logical its stupid to talk now about voting rights, And Pay Gap that's a mith(Now there's no wage OR PAY GAP , if there was , ,all business company will Employ women , because its profitable for business company) , On Ground Reality Feminist are Practicing different, and What feminist really is , Now Every women has equal rights, then What are they fighting for? , they got even more advantage  now in  society, Feminist say men should express there emotions (Like crying) And at the same point They want men who's strong, because its biological grinded in women that if they see a men cry they loose attraction towards men, [patriarchy, don't allow men to cry , bullshit, That has nothing to do  with patriarchy] And Women these days got more Powers then men , [you already Know what powers i am talking about given by the stupid law , a law which was created on the basis of history not what's going now ] .... 


Women's Tend to take decisions on How They Feel Rather than what's truth (because biology again) , that's why they terrible decision makers in politics,  
And Don't Compare anything to those shitty Bollywood Movies , Bollywood is fu**inkg Your mind . Women's Already Have Every right That Men Has , then What do They Want ."

"Society doesn't need a patriarchal, matriarchal, or even feminist culture, the domain of any of the stated above here will eventually suppress the other. But this is an ideal state, which is close to impossible, as the people want dominance of their race. People have to think about this seriously and what they want to provide for the upcoming generations. What legacy they are going to gift to their children? Greed and the concurrent world scenario play a vital role in what culture the world would adopt and what legacy the people are going to carry forward."

"The Dhruv's version of Definition of faminism just missed a simple point ""Equal rights between male and female doesnt mean identicality of roles. I would say a sane person whether a male or a female whether he/she is a feminist or not won't draw an analogy between faminism and patriarchy. This is stupidity. And 3rd wave of faminism is even more nonsensical than this video."

"Hi @dhruvrathee, I have a question. Why do women receive alimony in divorce cases? What needs to be done about this situation?
My friend is going through a divorce, and the woman has abused various laws. She has filed multiple cases, including an FIR against his family, accusing his elderly father of raping her with the help of his mother and the man himself. Why is no one investigating or questioning the woman? The case is now in the Supreme Court for Quashing of FIR (the boy's parents are mentally traumatized by the allegations). Everyone knows the case is false, and she filed it to pressure the boy and his family. Judges are urging them to settle the matter privately.
How can such women dare to file false cases and manipulate the legal system? Why aren't judges questioning the parents about the alleged rape or asking the woman if she's telling the truth? Instead, they're asking the boy to provide alimony and settle the matter. Is this the equality we strive for in society?"

"If women working and having a career is feminism, then women choosing to stay at home and looking after their families is also feminism.
There's nothing wrong with women choosing not to work. 

Being a woman myself, I can say that unfortunately its women themselves who have ruined the feminist movement.

Men are suffering everyday because of unfair laws that 'empower' women in terms of divorce, alimony, maintenance, child custody, cruelty.

Where is the equality in that? Why the bias towards women?

I've seen and known women who fight men for their rights but they spend their entire life demeaning and defaming other women. How is that feminism.

Equality is an illusion. What we truly need is mutual respect for all. Irrespective of gender, caste, religion, color and everything else."

"where does it says patriarchy is defined ""control over women"". you are saying the interpretation to support your narrative. 

I do watch most of your videos and I gain knowledge but I disagree with the interpretation - please give credible evidence of your argument"
"Except Muslims, Dhruv Rathee speaks about all religions and cultures. See how much afraid he is of Muslims. That's why Muslims are backward because they have been kept backward."

"In Islam, both men and women are considered equal in their spiritual worth and accountability before God. They are both regarded as equal partners in worship, responsibility, and reward. However, while Islam promotes equality, it also acknowledges the biological and social differences between men and women, assigning them different roles and responsibilities based on their strengths and abilities. For example:

1. **Spiritual Equality**: Both men and women are equally responsible for fulfilling their religious obligations, such as prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage.

2. **Social Roles**: While men and women have different roles in society, such as caretaking and providing, these roles are complementary rather than superior or inferior. Each gender has its unique strengths and responsibilities.

3. **Modesty and Behavior**: Islam promotes modesty and respectful interaction between men and women. Both are encouraged to lower their gazes and behave with decorum in their interactions with the opposite gender.

4. **Education and Knowledge**: Islam emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge for both men and women. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, ""Seeking knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim,"" thereby emphasizing the importance of education regardless of gender.

5. **Legal Rights**: Islam grants women various legal rights, including the right to inherit, own property, engage in business, and seek divorce under certain circumstances. 

6. **Protection and Respect**: Islam emphasizes the protection and respect of women's rights, including protection from abuse, exploitation, and discrimination. The Quran explicitly condemns any form of violence or injustice against women.

Overall, Islam teaches that men and women are partners in their journey of faith and life, each contributing to the betterment of society and the fulfillment of God's will in their unique capacities."

"A patriarchal society functions much better than a female run society - there are numerous researches on it published in reputed journals. But, that does not change the fact that women deserve equal rights - which includes the right to be not a bread-earner of the family. At the same time an ethical man should never be offended if their spouse contributes financially and earns more than him. Being respectful of each other is important for both the parties."

They are patriarchal.
They are proud.
They are unapologetic.

"Marriage is also a tradeoff .
Man provides security. Woman provides comfort. Children make family.  Support is guaranteed.
But.
Individuality is lost. 

In todays world,  one cult is winnng everywhere because its not giving up on primacy of family and patriarchy. 

No one openly talks about it because all are scared.

Everyone attacks a soft target. 

Hindus are soft target."
But kattar be like no LGBTQ++++++++
Thnku sir for giving informative vdo
"That is not the only problem though. And its pretty basic what you are saying, but you aren't addressing it in detail.  The feminist movement has forgotten feminism and is trying to move towards matriachy and misandry. 

This is not the case in India. But it is in the west. Barbie movie itself is one example where the doll was invented by a woman but they show men as the people who are the problem. And that grosses a billion dollars. 

Just because there is no violence doesn't mean there is no misandry. Animal and Barbie are the same just on 2 different ends. 

Also why call it patriarchy if we are talking about the victims and if you clearly mention that men are also the victims of current system. Why is it that men are blamed for it? Why would men want a system that's harmful to them? Why would they setup a system where they let women go out the titanic first? 

Then now lets be honest, women have had benefits and men have had benefits. Men maybe more and women less. 

the problem is the wording and how this is turning into misandry movement. I don't mind feminism. I support it. BUT the hypocrisy is seen in many elements. and this is such a surface level video."
"Offcourse , I am a female, I do not hate men , I hate indecent men. Either of the extremes,say it  feminism or patriarchy/misogyny are unjust & danger to society . How difficult is it to see other homo sapiens, (your own species)  with the perspective of humanity , human beings with humane perspective . 
Seeing such extreme trends I really wonder , how difficult is it to practice, rationalism & responsibilityтЭУтЭУ."

Irrespective of the crime committed by a woman or a man, the punishment should be equal. Just as violence against women is a heinous crime, so violence against men is an equally heinous crime. But if justice is done to women, if the man does not get any justice or if the responsibility is unilaterally imposed on the man, then That too is an injustice. Crimes committed by men are just as unjust, crimes committed by women are equally unjust.

Regardless of gender, see crime as crime.

Have you thought that if a woman falsely accuses you in the court, you will be punished just because you are a man, but if a woman wrongs you, she will not be punished?

But in the eyes of the law the criminal is punishable according to his crime irrespective of gender.

I hate both sexual racisms equally.

So I believe in the rights both women and men as they deserve."

Dude feminism is actially becoming a problem day by day becoz they not only want equal right they actually hate mens
"Just imagine guys how easy the family finance will get if our mom and sisters would have also been in some earning process some might have solved it for small and  some might even have solved it for the whole family but what actually happens there hard work that only limits till looking for household works there smartness only limits till her kitchen she is not taught of any passion or hobbies bcos the society teach and fill in there mind that only looking after the house is your only hobby u can have 
this can't be changed suddenly but we now are enough educated to know the reality and the real ideal human we can be so this idea  might be not applicable to our moms its already too late but it can be for our daughters or our wife so atleast a future will be a better place to live

Love u dhruv I like u first Time actually win my mind because of girls boys have been became berojgar Few decades back one person earned and family not but nowdays girls earned and expected boys should earned 5 times more than them. If girl earns 1 crore she expect maximum 5 crore minimum 2 crore sorry maximum no limits if girl have 2 cars boy should have 4 cars minimum maximum no limits and ultimately girls  got sympathy girls want more and expect gender equality

"People say that тАЬA single mom or dad can also make a child grow as a good personтАЭ
That's false 
No I'm not a gender inequality supporter 
I think there's a reason why god made the pair of humans to live together as male and female 
A mother can make her son grow as a good boy but he will always be a good mama's boy 
It requires a dad to teach him at a certain age what he should do at times and makes him efficient to be able to manage his own family and therefore that's how he also becomes a dad
Anda mother also has a important role which I guess we all know

"I believe it's crucial to acknowledge and appreciate the inherent differences between men and women. While it's true that both genders possess unique strengths, it's essential to recognize that these strengths often manifest differently. Men tend to excel in areas requiring physical strength and endurance, which historically led to their dominance in tasks like construction and agriculture, and every other field that requires more physical presence, just look around and think about it when you're walking on the roads made my men and looking at the buildings and eating the food that you're about to put in your mouth

Women possess innate qualities that make them exceptional caregivers and nurturers. Their emotional intelligence and empathy equip them well for roles such as motherhood and caretaking. These differences aren't indicative of superiority or inferiority but rather complementarity.

The notion of patriarchy, often misunderstood, reflects not a system of oppression but rather an acknowledgment of historical roles and contributions. Regarding decision-making and emotional management, there is indeed differences in approach between men and women. Men often prioritize logic and rationality in decision-making, while women considers emotional factors more prominently. Men and women have traditionally played distinct but equally valuable roles in society, contributing to its functioning in different ways

In modern society, there's a growing trend towards open-mindedness and inclusivity, which is commendable. However, this openness should not come at the expense of disregarding biological and psychological realities. Embracing diversity of thought and perspective while respecting biological differences is key to fostering a balanced and harmonious society.

I hope you guys understand what I'm trying to say here, I'm not deragarding femism, I'm just acknowledging apparent facts and logic here"

"The freedom and power should be given to deserving ones, who are mature enough to take responsibilities, contribute to home and society.      The ultimate agenda should be to make family and society stronger.  If we allow one section of our society (who is critical influencer at home and with children) to be weak, the society or family will be weaker by 50%.    Rather than following any ideology we should be practical and rational.   At least poor class, lower middle class and middle class cannot afford uneducated - non working wives.  People are loosing jobs due to ever changing technology world.  In that case if a woman is educated, she can support her family.   If a man cannot earn for family, he should take over domestic responsibilities and vice versa.    Few women use their husband's money to spend on luxuries, that is not real feminism.   Be strong and contribute - that is way of life!"

What about equality of punishment ?
"after hearing about the true definition of feminisim I can proudly say Islam gave all the rights to women more than 1400 years ago where girls used to be burried alive , men used to use them for thier lust , they were never given the right in property , they we never given the right in marriage.  but Islam gave all these rights to women with dignity.  
But Sadlt, In Pakistan , in the name of feminism there is ony promotion of hatred towards Men , Hatred aginst your own brother , father & Husband . promotion of nudity irrespective of what kinda a religion or culture that specific society follows , they only have one motto of Mera Jism meri Marzi with the concept of whatever I want to do I will do . irrespective of its consequences   it being right or wrong ."
ЁЯТЪЁЯЗзЁЯЗй
first time i felt this guy is a simp
Very nice video
Today I understood the real meaning of feminism and patriarchal expectations.
"You have touched so many points on a touch and go . And given ur narrative . However kindly explain this confusion. 

I presume laws and rights are equal for man and women . There is no law that a man has that a women dosent in general . ( Mind u I am stating facts mainly of usa as all this is passed down from there ) 

Inspite of that the sentences given to women are lesser than man for same crime. Divorce and family courts over whelmingly favour women against men. 

Women don't have the burden of proof and are taken at face value where as the burden of proving innocence falls on a man no matter what the case .  Exceptions are always there not interested in that. I am talking on majority. 

Where is the equality in that. 

These movies of feminist that u mentioned which u brushed off. The sad reality is that this is the wave of feminism that is present now . 1st wave and 2 nd wave feminism is all gone. 

A very important point u refused to elaborate on . When women are brought up educated and pushed in society to be strong empowered and independent . Ask the question who are they independent from.  They are brainwashed to think and act that way . U think they will change after enjoying all the benefits of no accountability. 

Men on the other hand have to work hard so that people can be dependent on him. And end of the day if he fxks up nobody is coming to save him or marry him .
You put down these playboys. Agreed . But u forget what they are able to do or people like them are very few percentage wise . However u forget no matter what u say women are attracted to them and not the nice guys.  Women are  attracted to these traits yet complain when the man exhibits exactly what she was attracted to.  

Now to ur female fans . No matter what rules the feminst brings in the dating market. It's the same percentage of successful men that are gonna enjoy even more  women than they presently are .  However the nice guys simple guys etc etc etc  will keep loosing out. It is exactly like the rich will get richer and poor just gets poorer. 

Also no known so called western ""feminists"" are fighting for men rights etc. they don't care about men . Infact the trend now is I don't need a man . I will freeze my eggs.  This is not an equality movement my friend. Wait and watch how this keeps getting worse in India . It's only a start. 

Usa figures are out 45 ,% Of women age of 40 will be single and childless by 2030-2035 .  That's superb news thanks to the feminist movement and society pushing strong and independent women. 

Society pushes women to be strong and men to be dial down ie be weak.  What else do expect  apart from suicides and loneliness . ЁЯШО

It is a sad reality and we all will face the brunt of it ."

"We should also differentiate between ideals and practice.Ideal feminism is good but look at the practice. There are a lot of rabid feminists who have grabbed the light away from sensible one and their views are what are amplified in the mainstream. That is why feminism has a negative connotation attached with it. 
So I'm not  a ""feminist"". I consider every human being has an equal worth and take my decisions based on that. Also feminism still has a lot of contradictions. A simple idea of equality is enough for me functioning in the world"

It should be changed into 'Gender equality', then most of the population will be able to understand the term and will definitely feel connected."

Taking examples from 1950 and 60s to advocate or sugarcoat the wrongs happening today is dangerous. What exact rights do men have that women don't? Society's conditioning cannot happen through law. A smart man and a dumb man are different and get paid differently. Your DEI agenda and clubbing all feminist as just peace loving and not dominating is just misleading. But hey that is what you always do.

"Feminism thrives to give equal rights but we never see feminist women working labour jobs, midnight taxis, border security, front army. Why?

Patriarchy is based on human nature that we have lived for thousands of years. If you change that into modern feminism, alot of things will change overtime and gender roles wouldnтАЩt exist. Similar to whatтАЩs happening in the US. Compare white men to Middle Eastern men. White men are becoming weaker and are losing their masculine role in the society, this is only going to make another power to control the society easier. Like the government. Strong men are the authority."

@dhruvrathee women who do wrong thinks aren't backed by feminists but we also expect feminist to stand by man's side when he is right and women is wrong. There are many cases where if a girl suffers even masculinists support a girl but feminists never speak for men. What about that?

"This video never mentioned that when govt tried to make rape gender neutral, feminist groups stopped it. It never mentioned rape under false pretense of marriage or plight of men. Feminism means equality of rights for women, it would be called egalitarian if it was about equal rights for everyone. This was just complete virtue signaling.

"I just want to live life the way my parents or grandparents lived. In their time, men were taking responsibility of external affairs and women took responsibility of home and kid's affairs. Both men and women had their sufferings. Neither man nor the woman had very comfortable life then. However, their mind and bodies are conditioned through ages of evolution as well as coaching by elders. Except for some injustices towards women, and sometimes men, it was bit easier for both of them as responsibilities were clearly outlined. Most jobs were only to be taken by men, and these men could marry women to take care of them and share the prosperity from the earnings.

But feminism produces a confusion as to who is responsible for the external affairs of earning and internal affairs of managing home and raising kids. Jobs are already reducing due to automation and machines, besides closure of many govt posts. And with girls taking the few jobs, it becomes difficult for men to get jobs. Now with women settling for less pay, or securing a job by unleashing her sensuality on a male hiring manager, it becomes easier for women to procure a job. Men are forced to join a less paying job or become a shopkeeper. Do you really assume that girl who gets a high paying job settles for any guy of a lower salary or work? How many woman want to continue their job until retirement of age 60? Some may normalize it but reality is way different.

How many times do you notice a woman proposing a man? It's always a man's risk to be mocked for his inadequacies. The fact is even the feminist woman actually believes in patriarchy only.

I support the abolition of sati, right for women's education and suffrage, women's right to choose her partner, etc.. but beyond these I don't see much of a purpose in reservation for women in jobs, legislative seats, and engineering college seats, etc.. If you got talent grab these on merit only. 

There are countless videos on social media where western women are sharing their pain on how they are frustrated carrying the feminist flag and fighting men. I certainly do not want that to happen with my people."

"Finally someone who actually understands feminism. People believe everything they see on social media and always insult feminists even women. When I said I didn't like Animal, they said ""feminist ho kya"" and it was a girl, when I said cheating is wrong, they said ""boys will be boys"" and we have to accept that we can't stop them from having such ""thoughts"" for other girls and when I tried to argue they said ""feminist hai kya"" . When I said that my mother taught both me and my brother all the house chores and my brother probably cooks better than me and that's how it should be everywhere they were like yeh ladkiyo ka kaam hai ""feminist hai kya"". Ha hun feminist koi problem."

"This is over simplified. I agree that feminism by definition promotes equality and true feminists just want the end of patriarchy but the ground reality is very different and the support many women get from feminism just becomes the abuse of power. 

For example, it is very likely for an employed man to marry an unemployed woman than vice versa. Statistically, 75% of women won't marry an unemployed man and an unemployed man is 33% more likely to get divorced.

What many women do here is that they use the movement of feminism to fight for example ""Equal employment opportunity"" and after they get a job, they return to their patriarchal mindset and suddenly wouldn't like to marry a jobless man. 
Events like these are the reason why feminism in the current world has become a useful tool for vicious women who instead of promoting equality use it for their personal gains."

Please don't misunderstand it.
Yes I am a biologist and, I want you to understand carefully. In this scenario we are talking social values, not natural values. We are  taking about Social Hierarchy and diversity Not Taxonomic Hierarchy and Biodiversity.
WOMEN AND MEN ARE NOT SAME THAT IS WHY THEY NEED EACH OTHER.
If we were biologically same then we wouldn't do Sexual reproduction, we would have done conjugation instead (like bacterias do).
Socially Speaking, What we need is not equality but Equal opportunity.
Even if we have most of the same organs that doesn't mean we have the same capability. Some people are good at something some are not, regardless of their gender.
That is why what we need is ""Equal Opportunity"" not forced equality.
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND."

"I find south indian men more comfortable with their emotions and feelings. It is not common in tamil, telugu or malayalam to shame men if they express weak emotions like in Hindi. Females have had almost equal say in the households. I find south indian men leaning more towards natural feminism than north indian men.

"Tbh 
The definition of feminism nowadays is actually differs from one what it actually have.
Or it's not wrong to say that the so called feminists of nowadays are nothing but the one who are having mindsets of Matriarchial society.
As they want everything which is not wrong but at the same time in need of everything or in name of everything the fake allegations are very common on men nowadays this is the harsh truth and yes it is.
They  don't wanna show that what they are or of what they actually capable of but if found guilty in something four tears out allegations blames imposed and hence this is what the actual definition of feminism is nowadays."

Highlighting Western concepts of psychology - They do not exactly coi-relate to Bhartiya People. 2. No historical background of Bharat towards these issues except a few greats who removed the evils from society, 3. Bharat has evolved completely differently then rest of the world, here patriarchal notions do not  coin-side with western world, In Bharat Women hold a sacred place in society although they did face a lot of music, the general evolution of women were Dharmic altogether. Hence, i would suggest dig deep before coming uout with sensetive topics and stop following western trends.

I want to ask that if feminism is about giving equal rights to both men and women. Than there is a temple in India where the deity menstruates every month and men are not allowed to visit at that time period. Will be count this as rights that should be given to men under feminism?
why didnt u talked about alimony and child support and how a women can just accuse someone for r4pe and the entire man life also the court is so unfair to men also how there is 40 percent quota for women in higher post also talk about how men became weaker s3x in scandanavia because how feminist it is

These movies gives wrong directions and influenced  both genders some in negative sense and some positive sense . No one know about real feminism .
Great explanation. Well researched and explained both sides of the issue.
"There's a differnce  of physical power when one raises hand on the other gender. It is not about raising hand, it is about respect of every person who is different than the other. It is rightly said that the main commonality between every race (men, women, caste language, ehtnicity) is that all are different and diverse. Respect everyone for their identity. The opposite of patriarchy, matriarchy or feminism is EQUALITY. 
WHICH ACCEPTS THE DIFFERENCE OF EVERYBODY ACKNOWLEDGING THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH OF A MAN AND THE DELICATE WOMAN. 

When any one uses harsh tone of voice or raises hand on the other gender, it should never be called matriarchy, patriarchy or feminism, it should simply be called WRONG."

"6:05 Dhruv Did you even watch animal? What you just listed  ranvijay does the opposite of that
1: he lets his wife work
2: he listens to everything she says
3: he doesn't force her for sex and only does it when she wants to
4: ranvijay is shown touching Gitanjalis feet's and staying there multiple time
5: ranvijay fights with his jija for mistreating his sister and not letting her work 
Now how is he a woman hater? Like every thing he does is opposite of what you say"
Very informative.... well explained

Easy going you took the topic and made 90 percent video supporting stupidity. You have seen why families were more happy in the past. Because the roles and responsibilities were divided. The competition is built by Rich people pehle Ek job k liye Pehle sirf men compite karte thein and Pay were good. While now man and Woman both are competing for the same job and now the company will make less pay because competition has got increased. The system is controlling you.

He didn't say anything about 300000  years of evolutionary history, hypergamy, divorce laws in India, everything wrong everywhere is still because of Patriarchy. Doesn't matter if it's patriarchy or feminism every ideology created by humans has it's pros and cons, maybe one has more pros than the other.

thank you so much for making a video on this topic for I had been sick of retarded losers portraying feminism as something it isnt just to depopularize it
"I disagree with you with some points.
I support that woman should be free and should have equal rights in the society. But Man is made stronger. He can face many situations  better then women and similarly women is better in some situations. They should play their role. Man should earn his and his family living. If Woman want to contribute she can also do a job or something to help. Similarly sometimes In household work men should help women. I think Patriarchy is not bad because it is a system of society or government in which the father or eldest male is head of the family but in this system women should be free and men should not constrain women for something she wanna do.
This was my opinion If anyone want to reply I'll appreciate it"

1} feminsm talks about equalitiy but as all we know govement supports only women as reservation is given to men
a)recently womens one third reservation in lok sabha bill was passed where as becoming a memmber of lok sabha is a pure intrest of anyone i understarnd that women should be given chances but resrvation is not the absolute way
2} as we know many many and many laws of harassesment divorces etc are made for women no such made is for men 
and many more are there but im m tired of typing byee"

talking about mhatma gandhi he was a preson who usually had a patracial mindset in all his movements women . such as in civil disobedience women were significant part of movement and helped to burn foreign clothes and pickted liquor shops. but altough their participation when it came to giving political rights gandiji objectified their work as of to do house hold chores and nourish their children  .....

"Your statement seeks 
In essence, we recognize and honor living beings not by their physical appearance, but by the essence of their souls. As Lord Krishna elucidates in the Bhagavad Gita (5.18), a humble sage, endowed with true knowledge, perceives with equal vision the intrinsic value in all beings, whether it be a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog, or even a dog-eater. This perspective encourages us to see beyond the superficial differences and acknowledge the universal spirit that animates every form of life."

11:24 is the truth
Everything has its positive and negative side. . While feminism is giving opportunities to women yet most of the women are taking adv.of being a woman in todays world. . .no matter evn if its against the morals n ethics of the society. . .many woman are corrupt in their doings in the name of feminism. . They're literary accusing their husband n his family for properties n wealth. .its good that a woman should be heard but evn a man should be heard.. . If a man has to go for a date in the court evn that woman should be present but the court doesnt give a damn if the accuser is present or not.   Evn if she doesnt come for an entire year no warning is given to her while the man is to be present on every date OTHERWISE he'll be arrested. . What kind of justice n equality is this kind of feminism

I also support your motive of video but over feminism and wrong feminism is not for good for our society.
Are you a Feminism (comment)
"This patriarchy and feminist debate is a total mess. I am Muslim women and I believe both men and women are equal but not similar and both should have equal opportunities but not same responsibilities. Here I would say respect should be given to every work I.e., primary responsibility of a man is to earn and primary responsibility of a women is to do good upbringing of a child ( I donтАЩt mean household work or any type of work, I mean to be available to a child for the childтАЩs emotional needs. To teach the child moral things good and bad thing) but not everyone has the same situation so both husband and wife can cooperate with each other as per their situation. If a man is not able to work due to health issues or if he is not able to find work or if he is less educated than wife or due to any circumstances the wife can work and vice Versa. Bringing up a future generation is the biggest responsibility so donтАЩt belittle it by comparing it with washing dishes or mobbing g the floor."

"I've Been Watching Your Videos Science 2023 but This Video Isn't As usual. I think You just Go with the flow That the Present Modern society are going throw. 

So For example I'm giving you a situation suppose In A protest Men And Women Take part and Police charge on the protest. They Beat Both Genders Then why Give more sympathy To women. Isn't Men are Deprived off? 

I think In the name of feminism They Are Trying To convert the Society Female Based. 
I Am Aware Of These Women Rights  But Now Days Divorce Rate is Increasing Alarmingly And on of the biggest Reason Is Husband and wife are not giving Much time to them. I Don't say Women Should not go to office,the fact is men and women's Don't think in the same way. They Do Job Till 7 Pm Came back From Office They don't interact And There comes The possibility of being Possessive And You Know Women are more possessive Than man, you agree or not.
I know Without Educating women a nation can shine. But in The Name of Feminism What they are doing is totally Fault. Women and men can't be equal women can't do Those work that Man can. So Equality Is Not suitable here. What we can do that if men became possessive Then Women have the right to take against Him."

"Hi Druv, by any chance can I get this in English or in Deutsch?"
Bro come and live in India and get to know about the current emotional stress in the society and its complexity at the root level...... Things are not so easy to be implied.Reality is different... We also see girls using boys to pass thier time and use them for their economic benefit... When they are done they change the person like nothing happened or blame the boy for the emotional stress... We need to understand the moral values and mutual respect rather than pointing only one gender... Building trust and compassion can lead us to a better society since both men and women have both good and bad in them........ THANK YOU FOR READING ЁЯЩП

"Thanks , Dhruv for making balanced video. 
In Maharashtra there have been large number of social activists who awakened the people before the word Feminism came in the use. Mahatma Phule, Savitribai Phule, Agarkar, Maharshi Karve and so on. 
But from 70s Dr. Vidya Bal has published her views about feminism in her magazine Miloon saryajani. She has emphasized that we are not against men but we want men and women to work together for enrichment of their life. Thankfully that time Maharashtra government was of progressive  thoughts and arranged for subsidies for this magazine. They have helped large number of women from different strata of the society."
"in reality the feminism you are describing has been dissolved by those who are using this as a shield to justify their bad actions, there are very few people who we can really say that they really are a feminist most of the people just use it as their convenience."

"4:29 Dear Dhruv love your content in general but you example where the lady says is it necessary for women to get out of home felt a little off. Offering a choice vs forcing people are two entirely different things. I think forcing women or even men to be a particular way be it in the name of feminism or patriarchy is bad. Earlier it used to happen as patriarchy now even the extremely vocal feminists have started to push/force women in the name of their cause to conform to a particular role. I wish we had a neutral term which we could be associated with, one where every human were free to be the way they wanted."

"Yes all the points mentioned in the video are correct, but you have failed to acknowledge one major issue which has become mainstream in all forms of media, which is pandering to toxic feminism, be it movies, tv shows, even stand up events, women are just being portrayed as superior to men, then there constant humiliation of men showing them as stupid, voilent or just incompetent creeps, feminism is about gender equality but in todays world it's just becoming an excuse for female entitlement."
"Dhruv rathee major videos mei sirf Hindu ko hi target krte hai, jese ki femenist ke iss video pe hinduism ke kch words ko nikala gaya hai... Dhruv rathee majorly hinduism ke beliefs ko hi challenege krte hai..aur kyu na kre unke so called ""liberals"" aur ""mullas"" naraj ho jayenge na"

"Hmm, I agree with you. But you forgot to make something clear there are two types of feminists: feminist and toxic feminist.
Although bad people exist everywhere in every community, race and gender.

The only thing is that our younger generations are thinking that these fake feminist movies represent true feminism and this problem also exist with younger males, they tend to get the wrong idea about masculinity because they follow some trash influencer (I am sure, I don't need to specify who).

And this problem is very serious in western countries, so it should be no surprise that one day our country's population will try to copy the western culture just like we always have."

"In the Quran, IтАЩve not found places where Allah specifically commands the domination of men over women. On the contrary, the Quran revealed over 1400 years ago, confirms the spiritual equality of women and men, gives women the right to inherit, to own property (and not to be considered property), to seek a livelihood, to marry only by their consent, to divorce and keep their children, and to be educatedтАФrights that were won by Western women only in the last century. Verses in the Quran that suggest patriarchal arrangements are in response to specific historical circumstances only.
Allah has resolved this debate if Islam is followed in true letter and spirit.
The equality of men and women is wrong to debate the right debate is true justice among both.

"Its a great video but still incomplete, you didn't talk properly about pseudo feminism and how it is much much more harmful than patriarchy. You will find that the cases like Neha Dupia, that girl slapping the boy and movies like four more shots are increasing the society in the name of pseudo feminism, if at other end there are chapri males then there are chapri females as well, who really think that smoking, drinking and having casual sex is women empowerment. Check US what the situation is there, divorce rates are at all time high. Also yes the females can never be equal to males, because the physical strength and mental strength is different. They are ""feminine"" and men are ""masculine"". In army as well, women are not allowed to participate in actual combats, and the other side is males are weak in terms of emotional strength, a mother can still give complete parenting to a child but a father alone can't.

That's why I feel the fight should be not about changing the roles but it should be about equal opportunities"

Equality Doesn't fit with their physical attribute they can't bear the same job as men. Irony is, this capitalist society Doesn't allow this doctrine,  they use our women as product."

So why feminist always demand for womens wright???"
"Men and women are equal . We find good and bad in both , high IQ and low IQ s in both.
 only because women gave birth it cannot bring such a huge difference between men and women."
"I agree with the mindset showcased in video. But I have a problem with the word feminism. If feminism is equality, then we should run a campaign for meninism. If you want equality and equal rights, we should focus on the word equality. What I am saying is that we should not create more sub divisions and words that create more identity politics. Focus can be on equality. It doesnt require an outside agency to attain equality and equal rights. Feminism in some quarters ofcourse will and has become an ideology which it is, and it diminishes it credibility. But equal rights in itself is absolute"
Brilliant Dhruv!! Society needs people like you to teach the mass. You are simply amazing.
"This is all nonsense. Men should always maintain control over their emotions; no man genuinely desires to cry, and if they do, they should strive to control themselves. Men who display such high levels of emotion, including crying, are often associated with school shootings and domestic violence. Throughout his video, he repeatedly emphasizes that society tells girls that they are being judged. However, it's not solely society; girls desire certain attributes in men across the world, regardless of whether they identify as liberal or conservative. Men and women are inherently different, living by distinct rules shaped by patriarchy, which has taken us from the jungle to the moon. I suppose it's not all bad. These ideas might seem plausible on paper, but in the harsh reality of the world, which these liberal morons have no understanding of, they simply do not work. As a man, if you embrace feminism or weakness, as he suggests in the video, the majority of liberal feminist women would never consider you a potential partner."
"Tum jis vampanth aur western society me rhte ho Dhruv, usme Aisa hi hota h sahi kaha tumne, aur usi me feminism ka jarurat bhi h.

"As a human men are still struggling to get basic human rights and protection from constitution
Such as 
1. Sexual harrasment laws should be gender neutral
2. If a boy watches or capture half naked or naked images of girl will get 7 years jail but if girl does same with boy then no punishment
3. If a boy disrobe any girl he will get at least 7 year jail but if girl does same thing to boy then no punishment
4.If a girl make promise to marry and had relation with boy & at the time of marriage deny to marry him no punishment for her but if boy did same he will face rape charges, 10 years of jail and only on girls statement immediately arrest
5. If a wife had sexual relation with man other than her husband then no punishment for her instead if on this ground if husband ask divorce he has to pay alimony (only if she is in live in relationship with her boyfriends during marriage then alimony can avoided)if man does the same he can land in jail in 498a due to mental cruelty cause by his affairs to his wife and need to pay alimony to her.
5.if you live with your wife but didn't had sex. And wife gets pregnant by other man still its your responsibility to pay for child.
6.If wife does physical or mental cruelty to husband he can only divorce but still has yo pay alimony to her. If husband does same wife can complaint 498a on entire family can arrest. And gets the alimony.
7. If any girl accused you for rape only on her statement you can arrested and if case turn out to false no punishment for her (in some cases court applies nominal fine)
8. Stalking is offence only punishment for boys 
9. Verbal abuse , physical abuse , emotional abuse, econmical abuse , mental abuse all this can only happens to women only and only boys can punished as per constitution

"I think 'Animal' movie mein sirf ek nhi, bohot sari psychological disorders show kiya gya hai, jisme admi ek parent ko super maan lete hai jinse wo bachpan mein ignored huya karte the. Narcissistic mentality bhi show kiya gya. Alpha male is a rule of jungle, not that of the human being. That's why the movie shows a negative name - Animal. Ek admi father se itna pyar karte huye bhi ""Animal"" kaha jata hai, because of his acts on women and his revengeful attitude. I found the film highly psychological, meaningful and educational as well."

"We need to understand that drinking, smoking aren't about women or ken empowerment... But about equality... about equali right to choose or making informed choice by a full grown adult...and aby gender making that choice should be respected and perceived in same way... Not men as just humsms drinking and smoking or having sex .but women doing these are labelled... or looked upon as easy..

Even being easy is one's own autonomy and choice...that should be respected... We don't call men easy but men are much easily available than women in reality... We don't label them... When those labels actually eull suit men wayyy more...

men and women are never gonna be equal on all grounds. and men will be always higher on the external matter and in family matter women hold much strong position.
u need to know that there is a difference between femanism and toxic femenism
"Mens rights activism, manosphere, incel, redpill groups are the biggest resoan behind destruction of the society, increasing violence against women, toxic masculinity, mens loneliness... And femimism is fighting back all these demons .. thats why femimism is under so much attack .. yes... many men purpisely don't want equality of any kind..."

And definitely smoking and drinking are informed choices of adult people... So is sexual freedom... Agar mard smoke or drink kar sakte hain koi nehi bolta ki yeh fake mens rights activism hain? Thrn why when women drink and smoke, these same men call it fake feminism? Whats the motive behind calling women's equal right to choose as ""fake feminism""??? Do they eben understand femimism? Ir trying to define it as per theor hypocritical biases??? Men kyo. Ja kar Sharab peete hain aur smoke karte hain? If those are normal tor them them thide are equally normal are respectable for women too... And yes... This is feminism... Those who deny this vasic equality of choice are the biggest fake men's rights activists and fake feminists... Feminism and equal rights can't be ""adhi adhuri""... Thats pseudo feminism... Which most men practice. 
Men should be allies to feminism... What what these men do instead is to try to mansplan what femimism should be according to men's convenience..."

WeтАЩre lucky to have guys like Dhruv to enlighten all of us
agree with vid but why you dont criticize the equality in our judiciary for men like fake cases alimony maintenance charge should be paid by men even if women is employed and men is unemployed what about the cases when men caught women cheating and in opposite women do case to men  and men goes jail please also address the blind feminism following that 'women is innocent until proven wrong  and men is wrong until proven innocent'
The idea of feminism is cool until it converts into toxic feminism.
I learn lot of things from this content. Thank Mr. Dhruv Rathee for this content. тЭдтЭдтЭд
"DEAR ALL FEMINIST JUST TELL ME ONE RIGHT THAT INDIAN MEN HAVE AND WOMEN DON'T HAVE, ( THERE ARE DOZENS THAT MEN DON'T HAVE BTW )"
Lol. Men and woman have different roles therefore they can never truly be equal. faminism is a cancer
Men and women are both equal. They both are made of sperm. So no physical discrimination. But islam made men more dominant. In daily life. Allah made  men stronger. He is in charge of house. If a woman do not obey his husband than she is doing sin... Muslims didn't know islanic teachings. Thats why they get astry and trapped by secularism
He's himself confused
No muslim should support feminism. Islam. Clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of ideal woman. Dhruv didn't knew about our religion. So do not blindly accept his secular views. Read sura nisa .All your doubts will be cleared. Yes their is code of conduct for Muslim men too. But feminism is more toxic then patriarchy.
Me nahi hu feminism k haq me
"My question is, why equal right to  drinking, smoking and sexual freedom can't be feminist issues??? Of you consider these as men's domain then you are not a feminist first of all .. if you think ok... At least a few things like drinking, smoking one night stands should be men's domain .. women should not do these ""in the name of feminism "" you deny women right to full sexual freedom then you are a fake feminist yourself...why women can't have equal rights and equal respect in exercising these right as much as men??? Yes these are feminist issues... Women choosing to drink or smoke or having multiple sexual partners as  full grown adults is feminism... 

Why a man is a drunk person but a woman drinking is a loose character?  Why a man is a stud but women is a s**t??? Is that feminism for you? 

My question is simple... when men drink, smoke, have one night stands...hire sex workers ..these men don't call out it as *fake men's rights activism* then if a woman do all of these, why they call it ""fake feminism*??? What's the logic? Actually these people are themselves fake men's rights activists... And biggest hypocrites..."

When my sister wnted to prep for neet and study in kota i saw this what will she do by studying thing in own my family 
You see these things on tv and just think its drama but no at some level it is reality
My Grandfather and grandmother were strictly against it 
After she failed her first attempt every one like we told you waste of money
Even my mom was against it for sending her 2nd time
I remember it as clear first time 
My dad and sister were talking and i was on my phone next to them
He was like if you wanna go and prep another year we'll go next week 

But i guess my sister got under pressure from like every body in family and eventually didn't go 

But she did cleared NET last year and is completing phd from DU

"People will only listen to the part of story that they want to listen and what is convenient to them. When I wanted to study, a lot of my relatives started giving examples of how educated girls can't find a suitable groom, they can't be a good wife, she will start smoking and drinking and make boyfriends. She won't be in control. But no such thing happened. 
Some people don't want women to get educated so they will give all the illogical reason to portray an educated woman as evil. Same happens with feminism as well. Some people don't want to give woman equal rights so they will start giving reasons on how feminism is bad. Whenever a woman does something wrong, feminism is blamed even when the woman is not even a feminist. Whenever something bad happens with a man feminism is blamed. Feminism is about giving equal rights to woman. It does not say that men are evil and woman are perfect but even if a woman is not perfect and makes mistakes, she still deserves equal rights and opportunities like how men get. 
All these reels that protray men's problem don't actually want to help men, they just want to justify men's shitty behaviour. Consider jyoti mourya case also, the man was victim there but there were very few posts that sympathise with him. Most posts were like ladki ko padhaoge to yahi hoga, ladki par bharosa karoge to yahi hoga. They just wanted to justify why men are right when they don't let women in their family study. The same men will support patriarchy and then cry about men's problem."

Instead of calling out people who asked you to review those movies if you had reviewed those movies and told everyone ""this is wrong"", I feel, it would have been better.

You, very conveniently, said that feminists don't support those movies or the hypocrisy of Neha dhupia and hence people showing that as fake feminism is wrong, but the truth is some fake feminists do use them and they equally bad as those chapris you called out. It would have been really good to see you call out those fake feminists too."

"But everywhere I see I see only the toxic feminism, I never saw feminism that Dhruv explained. Every girl I met wants men supirior to them in every way. If she is a PhD holder she wants a man more than that. she doesn't care about other less educated people even if they are graduated. They don't want men who gets less paid than them. They don't want men who are shorter than them. Why? I feel this will never change. The real feminism is never gonna happen. Untill it's nomenclature is changed from feminism to other word. Because everyone are thinking that feminism is something accociated with females due to its wording. Everyone is believing that if females don't accept the following things that I above mentioned( about marriage preferences) then when will men support women? I strongly believe in Feminism that Dhruv explained even before I know that it was feminism. But after I heard the word Feminism my mind totally changed that what I believe was different from feminism that everyone are portraying. Some people are even following different feminism which gonna impact on the society in the future. As far as this goes I am gonna stick to my beliefs and values and not gonna name that as feminism or any other thing. Because I wanna normalise it (feminism) without the word feminism. I really feel the word is distracting the actual goal of this"

"You didn't even called out what bullshit feminists throw at men when men express their problems. Patriarchy theory only looks at sexism from a female standpoint and I find that most feminists are 90% unaware of the different kinds of sexism against men or even claim that there is no such thing as sexism against men because men are privileged (talk about circular reasoning).
There is also the notion that sexism against men is only a side effect of patriarchy against women. This again conveys the female-centric view of feminism, because you could just as well say that sexism against women is just a side effect from sexism against men and that would be just as valid.
What we have is a society full of sexism that strikes both ways. Most sexist norms affect both men and women but in completely different ways. Why would we call such a society a ""patriarchy"" ?
 Biological differences led to different expectations for men and women, and these expectations have over time not only been cemented but also fleshed out into more and more norms, based on the consequences of the first norms. Many thousands of years later it has become quite the monster with a life of its own, dictating what is expected of men and women today. Again, why would you call this patriarchy or matriarchy instead of just plain ""sexism""?
If you concede that men having positions of power is not the source of sexism, then why name your sexism-related worldview after that fact? It is then just another aspect of sexism like any other, or even a natural result of the fact that men are biologically geared for more risky behavior. For example,  the vast majority of homeless people are men. Why is this not a problem to anyone (answer: male disposability)? Why is feminism only focusing on one half of the equation and conveniently forgetting the other half. Men exist in abundance in the top and the bottom of society. Why? 
So to sum it up. Patriarchy is a terrible name for sexism since sexism affects both genders and is not born of male power. Male power is a tiny part of the entirety of sexism and hardly worth naming it after.

That's patriarchy. I am also kind of baffled that you think the solution to mens problems is feminism. Because feminism has such a good track record for solving mens issues right? The fact is that feminism is a major force fighting against mens rights. Both politically, in terms of promotion of new laws and such (promise of marriage is rape, marital rape which is again not gender neutral etc.), this proves that they just want to extort men and treat them as ATM's, and socially, in the way feminists spew hatred upon the mens rights movement and take any chance to disrupt it. As well as the fact that a vast majority of the feminists I've met (and I've met many, both irl and online) have a firm belief that there is no such thing as sexism against men!
You seriously want us to go to these people for help with our issues?"

"I watched the complete video, and I strongly understand and appreciate all the points that Dhruv bhaiya kept. But I really have a genuine question, I often have heard form my mother, birth of a girl is not good because after their marriage, she'll move to her husband's house or like that. For which the parents of the daughter will have to live alone during their old ages. So, is it a patriarchal thinking? Additionally, when i said to my mom, that if father and mother of both sides will live together with their son and daughter, then it would be good, but she said that would be a shame in the society if the man will not allow them to stay or like that. I really think about this ЁЯдФ"

While women cannot operate on lust. Thats why you dont see a prostitution place in the world where man are available in stocks and women pay to have sex with them.

I can go on for days adding to this list, explainig the points of distinction between man and women and how they ultimately create a chaotic difference at societal scale.

"When we talk about equal right  do we also talk about equal responsibility? No, responsibility is for men but rights are for women, equality in real life can only be achieved when rights and responsibilities both are equally divided, there is a term called not working women but there is no term called not working men, is this the feminism"
"I'm stopping the video at 9:40 because I'm not interested in watching the rest. Personally, I support the idea of proper rights rather than absolute equality. It's amusing to me that both men and women advocate for equal rights. From my perspective, women hold a superior position to men, so naturally, I prefer they don't enter fields like politics or other jobs where they may face unwanted attention from men. My priority is ensuring the safety of my mother, sister, wife, and daughter, protecting them from any harm. However, the push for equal rights has, in my opinion, led to negative consequences.

The feminism prevalent in our society today is concerning because some men exploit it to fulfill their perverse desires. Unfortunately, many women fail to recognize this due to the modern feminist movement advocating for equal rights. In the guise of equality, women often find themselves disrespected and marginalized in various aspects of society. On the other hand, some men take advantage of my viewpoint, denying women the respect and care they deserve. This highlights the dark side of patriarchy, where women are subjected to unnecessary violence instead of being treated with love and affection.

In summary, I believe women should be highly respected individuals in society, but I also wish to shield them from the darker aspects of society."
"Sorry it's so wrong, what about women taking advantage of faminism, this is all one sided story, I agree for women empowerment but not for taking advantage of being female, in this world where dowry is illigle but alimony is legal"
It's better to be patriarchal rather than a feminist.

Feminism is a act which fight against violence done on females and also help females to go up in society. see feminism is made for females to get equal rights because in past females where not allowed to earn study and even say anything they treated worse than slaves basically a female was only kept alive because of her beauty and ability to give birth many girls were killed before or after there birth because they are considered an taboo is the society after this some females decided to fight against this and started some movements for ex feminism etc and even after this some people are misusing feminism and eventually crushing females I am not saying men are bad i am saying this thinking is bad this society was made only in favour of men and there problems that is why there is no act like feminism for men. My opinion

"Are we really talking about equal rights? So you are just saying that , by sitting in an AC room making statements about the patriachy system , have you ever wondered on what term feminists ask for rights? Do they want to protect our nation from neighbouring countries by holding a gun ? Or ever they protested about clashing in upcoming battles with opposition countries? No they just want equal opportunities in big companies where they can enjoy the luxury like men so? We gave them, they are enjoying it! ,In almost every sector they got reservation, dont you see? Have you ever heard the news that a women officer or soldier died during the duty? All the works which are risky will be done by men , and the so called feminists will not ask for the equal , work ,they ask for perks ,powers, nobody wants to get dirty and stinky in their own sweat , i never saw womens are deputed to hold the riots back and sacrificing their lives , all those pity goes to your patriachal men , but i have seen many women getting Commissioned to ips or ias, ЁЯШВЁЯШВЁЯШВ Why they just dont protest for the responsibilities already.

I am from pakistan I came to your channel for the first time. I agree with your thoughts Feminism should not be completely stopped but  because women do have rights ans that should be given to them even each religion has specified there rights whther it education respect or something else and brother when you study Islam you would find that it has given more protection and rights to women than men but the problem is that all those people who participate in women march or when most of the people talk about feminism they would try to separate the women from the men and that is i think the blunder God has created them for e├аch other and both are depndent on each other but movies and media always try to make the point that girls can leave for ever and they dont need a man bcz all that a girls needs is money if she is making money she is indepndent that ideology is devastating and that is not feminsm

"Dhruv sir there are many matters which requires the  involvement patriarchal society and on the other hand feminism has its own importance 
But the society cant move on with a one declaration of patriarchy or feminism different matters requires different ways to be sought out 
Like the one you talked that mens cant cry, this too affects as an important role in the protection of family as man is the protector of family and seeing the protector cry would definitely led to a negative impact on the self confidence  of a family

"In earlier times, feminism seemed like the right term, but in 2024, perhaps ""equalism"" sounds more appropriate. Kyunki sirf kuch charpri ladke hi nahi, kuch chapri ladkiyan bhi feminism ko matriarchy se confuse karti hain, and almost every average person associates feminism with female supremacy over men. Both genders are equal, so let's refer to it as 'equalism.'"

Patriarchy тЬКтЬКтЬК
"Well explained video. Very informative. I want to understand if the following falls under patriarchy.

1. News: XX women and XX children are fear trapped. None cares about male deaths
2. Any tragedy: First rescue females and children
3. War: Men should definitely participate in war
4. A random girl can hug and kiss a guy and call it a prank but if it happens the other way around then one can expect consequences

Are these examples of patriarchy which is similar to what he explained that almost everyone imagines a 'guy' when it comes to unemployment? Or is there some other theory or nomenclature behind these?

PS: I'm completely against the patriarchal society with a narrow mind that women belong to household chores etc etc however, I want to understand the above"
"I think we presently have equal rights for everybody, regardless of whether they are male or female 
 Jordan Peterson makes a really great point that there are a few things that men can't do, and there are some things that women can't do. In my opinion forcing yourself to do things you are not supposed to do  is toxicity, no matter who's doing it.
Within the title Feminism, they made ""Four More Shots,"" which glorifies the toxicity which was already done mostly by men.
 Instead of raising awareness and point out its harmfulness, they decided to normalise it.
Believe me as Dhruv as time and again explained these movies/ series does have influence on the viewers. After watching content like this some will be inspired and will start embracing it with a justification in their mind that since they can do it, so why can't we 
Toxicity has always existed and will exist, it cannot be completely eliminated 
I wish our people (men and women) to be more focused and inspired from great things done men and women for humanity instead of toxicity.

 At the end of the day, it comes down to the individual and their choice 
 So choose wise and choose who you want to be"

yep i understand the real meaning of feminism and for sure every human deserve equal rights .... but for that law which are being implimented currently in our county whether it's about relationship status and some crime cases that FIR by women will be considered without any reasons and males will be punished. it's true that many females are forced to lower their voice against these cases and for this they can't complain openly .... law is quite good but some of men which are not guilty also faces the problems.. like many laws are being passed and some females are using them for their own ....

Stupid thoughts. And stupid opinions
If we look at the western country now we all know it's not a good thing to follow their foot path.
"Since years men have been cheating their wives while going to wars special brothels made for them. Same is happening now, in metro cities clubs or pubs you find married and committed boyfriends hunting for women. While they still manage to fool their women, most still get married because some naive human utterly dependent on them and also fear of losing his materialistic approach not leave him. This behaviour was never called out. Still women find such men attractive and still such men have a happy married life but what about women? 
Women are emotional beings and when they realise that his love is different from theirs, some find their whole world crashing down. I haven't seen men suffering from feminism till now but have seen women suffering, and many ignore for their peace because money or not, you can buy a public hoe or even a private hoe exclusive for you. Then men, cry out for not getting unconditional love when the whole concept of love they have changed for us. All jotts down to the testosterone getting okay with many normal looking women than one beautiful one. Variety they want, selfish they become and purity they desire."

I accept your concern mr dhruv rathee but why you always target Hinduism and beleives for explaining these concepts what about islamic do they encourage feminism? You talk about christian society but i never saw you talk about anything regarding islamic not only no one in YouTube will never talk is this what you call equality? if we are discussing about then we should definitely discuss about every aspect of it but hiding the truth will not make it vanish one or the other day it comes out so whenever you make any video try not to target someone especially i hope you understood what i meant

Very few people undrstand feminism If feminism gives equal rights to women in society means they are also equal responsible for society.but most of them misinterpreted feminism and spread nudity/ vulgarity/ alcoholism. and degraded moral responsibility towards society. And  this gives opportunity to patiariarchy mindset people to raise voice against feminism. A lack of complete awareness can be seen among majority of women but not in all women. Hope this video should help

Wo bat alag h ki kahi sare topics ese h jisme hume female ku sunni chahiye, or kai Sare ese mamle hai jisme male ki sunni chahiye... We have different rights...

"Dhruv, you are quite smart, I must say. You know how to evade the topic which was to be discussed and mould the entire discussion into a particular corner. The discussion was about movies showcasing toxic & pseudo-feminism but you centered the whole video around ""alpha male chapri boys"" and their views on feminism. Also, you still didn't answer the main question : ""How can you justify Gangs of Wasseypur and Breaking Bad as cult classics and accuse Animal, having the same cinematic treatment ?"" You made a ""fiery"" review of Animal and put out statements about its consumers pretty wildly, what some people were asking you to was make a review on films such a ""Thank you for coming"" and ""Four More Shots"", but you took the other route. Clearly you always have a biasness & propaganda to serve a particular audience :) The real smart ones will understand this."
"Feminism means different things to different people. Whereas it is desirable for women to achieve economic success, it does not look like a good idea to sleep with random men. That's true for men as well. You would not consider a man in high regard if he sleeps around with too many women.  

I think it is intellectual dishonesty to first say ""well you believe in equality between men and women; hence you are a feminist"" and then automatically assume my opinion on sleeping around or making money by showing your butthole to the internet."

"I do not completely agree with Dhruv's opinion here but I believe men and women are complementary to each other and they should not be presented as competitors. There are specialities of women which men don't possess and vice versa. It is not just about some organs or physical strength differences between men and women but also psychological differences that make them best suited for different roles.
The protest should be against abuse of women and considering them inferior in every aspect. That should be changed."

"The crux of the matter lies in the harsh realities we face today. While legal frameworks advocate for gender equality, the prevailing issue is the societal acceptance of this principle. Take, for instance, the disparity seen in dating app culture, where a significant portion of women match with a select few men, perpetuating skewed dynamics. Documentaries like ""Indian Sons in Jail"" shed light on the misuse of laws that seemingly favor women, leading to a troubling notion of ""women always being right.""

This imbalance extends to legal matters, where many men find themselves disadvantaged, especially in cases of infidelity where alimony demands can still be made. The current legal landscape seems to place an undue burden of trust solely upon men, leaving them vulnerable in a society increasingly driven by self-interest.

While some women may adhere to fairness, the systemic bias remains a stark reality for many men, leaving them with little recourse. The shift from a perspective of all men being right to one where all women are perceived as such isn't progressтАФit's a distortion of justice.

Moreover, these laws often fail where they're needed most, as many cases go unreported, exacerbating mental health issues and even costing lives. The elites, untouched by such laws, further complicate the lives of the middle class, while influencers like Dhruv Rathee seemingly overlook these critical issues.

India's constitutional ethos of ensuring innocence prevails, even if guilty escape, falters in addressing the gender imbalance plaguing society. The erosion of family values and mental well-being underscores the urgent need for legal reforms that truly address societal needs.

The issues extend beyond gender dynamics, impacting population decline, job scarcity, and relationship dynamics. It's imperative to reassess the efficacy of current feminist ideologies and prioritize solutions that benefit all, not just a select few.

In a country like India, grappling with multifaceted challenges, it's essential to address these issues comprehensively and embark on meaningful dialogue and action for a more equitable future.


Im looking here for the views of not only law that gets formed but also the general impact of removing the narcissistic idiology of one gender while including the very same of the other. Majority or minority it does impact and place one gender at the heed of the other and the third wave feminism, also killing a large part of idologies necessary for the society, that include a concept of family, monogamy, diffrences between biological concepts of men and female harmones and the incredibly difficult dialogue, of the whole ideology, and its impact in reality,and it's ineffectiveness, and this video had it been made in 2000's , would be sufficient, but the fact of the matter is it's 2023. And i will not accept , the sheer dismissal of a major problem of 2024, based on the statistics of 50 years old ones and it makes no sense rather than just to appeal to the 100s of videos as such. Now lastly me taking the time to write a long comment and then edit it continuously to be able to to convey my point is not to just diss a respectable creator such as Dhruv rathee, but instead my respect for him, and how i think this video could've been more informative and not lack a complete dismissal of the other point of view to just meaningless jargon, in the last few minutes of the video. I as a 2024 male , refuse to apologise for the mistakes of something i wasn't the party to. While dissmising my generations reality, as a penance or just a represcussion of the past. Cuz i see no value in it, and hope to open a dialogue of discussion with dhruv himself. Which i hope he takes the time to read and reach out as well. Thats my 2 cents."

"Okay if women want equal rights then we should have equality everywhere. For example 

1) women should compete in sports with men
2) Women should work labor jobs and work as hard as any men in that field
3) Why most women dont study science  and engineering.
4) Most importantly women should support families financially just on der own. 
5) women should go 50/50 in every thing 
6) If men beat up  women then it should not be considered domestic  abuse. Instead just condemn as small minor crime
7) also we should hire equal.number of women soldiers as men soldiers 
8) Also women should not leave the country during wars."

"In the ""free world,"" all genders should have the freedom to pursue their desires in areas such as education, politics, and work. However, in the name of feminism, women today often feel pressured to excel academically and professionally, which can be disheartening. Feminism should offer girls choices and freedom rather than imposing obligations on them. It's essential to recognize that societal changes take time; the progress achieved in education and career opportunities over the past 50-100 years cannot instantly override thousands of years of societal evolution."

"While I completely understand and believe Women should get equal rights.... Every community has its own restrictions and law for women and modern day world would deny the fact that these restrictions and laws were created or introduced to maintain a balance between Humans in many areas in aspect of life. 

Yes, women can work, they can learn, they can educate themselves, they are free to go anywhere but the catch is if both Men and Women work who would look after their family? Who would take of their children? Who would look after their parents? 

Women are way stronger than man in many ways but men would still be superior. I not against the equality we are talking here about. I am only trying make my a point that Men and Women co-exist its cycle of life, Nature and system created by Earth or its people to maintain a certain balance, peace, harmony and love to this planet that we men are destroying. 

Women is stronger as they have a ability to empower herself and her family. Women can give anyone hope, Women can rectify or undo mistakes (I don't mean women pay for men's mistakes) men would do. Without women population wouldn't grow and it isn't in men's nature to give a birth to a child. It is a women and nature has created her for certain purposes that we should understand. 

I rest my case here concluding it by saying, Women is free to do anything but equality is something they should never look for and its against nature's law of mankind.

I am assuming few people wouldn't like this comment. I apologize if I hurt anyone's sentiment by this."

"Though I promote equal rights, but...
An interesting point here:
A man with a small brain(abnormal) and one with a proper brain will have different rights. Similarly, men and women have some major differences apart from organs like strength and love for children(scientifically and universally proven), why is it not ok for some rights to be there for the good of both women or men?"
Social life in India is very different from social life in western countries. Things that are considered normal in India are shocking for west and same is vice versa
"Dhruve Bhai hamare islaam mein dono ke rights equal hai,  but kuch chizon mein aadmi superior hai aur kuch chizon mein aurat superior hai  .. example,  Ghar mein chor agaya to pehle aadmi jakar us chor se nipata hai woh yeh nahi kahta ke hum equal tum chor se jakar lado.. to yahan par upar Wale ne aadmi ko physically takhat dekar superior banaya hai..aur bohat se cheezon mein aurat superior hai ..jaise ke maa ke khadmon ki niche jannat hai..."

If taking dowry is wrong then perhaps living expenses or subsistence fund(Alimony )is also wrong and yes I believe in equality."
I wonder why instead of coining the concept as 'feminism' the simple and more clear word equality was not used. It creates a wrong sense of preferential division in favour of females.

But I've some issues with your point @23:28 that no feminist have supported those views of Neha Dhupia...
But here is the problem ,the negation or assailant condemnation over such ridiculous statements never comes out from the feminist side at such steep extent than if a man does something wrong...
We never heard that. Might be in private or in their close circle they condemn such things...
But publicly it never comes out to such an extent....
See, for the betterment of the society condemnation amplitude from the feminist side should be the same for both the genders...

"So, the definition of feminism sounds fair in the ideal world. If you are a humanist, you are a feminist. Great! 

The problem is that the feminism ideas of today's girls are selective. A girl looking for an arranged marriage wants a guy who earns way higher than her, forget about accepting somebody who earns lesser than her. So, according to you she's having ""patriarchical"" values. However, the same girl wants equal (it's often more when they say equal) rights after the marriage. Now, she's a feminist. A double agent!

Often times, women seek feminism only when it favors to them. But, when it isn't so favorable, they are happy to off load that responsibility over to men. When you ask for equal rights, you should also be ready to take up equal responsibilities. And if that was the case, we would have seen equal number of women and men fighting the war for Ukraine.. I think men are just too nice to be ready to die for their families while women are busy with their equal rights campaign."

"The reason why feminism is associated with all the stupidity on social media, OTT and Bollywood is that, these people CLAIM themselves to be feminists. They claim to promote feminism through their work and spend a lot of money on marketing and advertising. So we see them more often than any other work from a genuine person. So people who don't have any idea about this topic will obviously think that the SO-CALLED feminist content that they are watching is what feminism stands for."

"First of all, ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE VIDEO CONTENT, it's just what the present society lacks and fails to understand. Even the video doesn't cover all the views but it does a really good job at pushing the issue, for example at 24:00 , feminism may not have supported the girl, and it is wrong to term this feminism but may this have been the other way round we would see all the feminists supporting the girl, but did we see a single feminist support the guy? I'm not sure if there was any but the issue was hardly seen ANYWHERE in the media, this is what feminism fails at, where are the equal rights for that man? 

I truly think there should be another video regarding men's issues and right only (rights such as the husband and wife's laws from our constitution which make literally about no sense)"

I would like to think I am a feminist but that inherent fear of those cases has always made me not fully invested in the movement . But who knows might just be my insecurity or something.

"I disagree with the onion and your research. While I generally agree with you most of the time, it's important to note that just because some famous people support feminism doesn't necessarily mean their IQ level is higher than ours. Being famous doesn't guarantee correctness, and I don't believe females should be denied the right to work.

Point 1: If a girl is saying we should have cerebral opportunities, I agree they should. However, claiming complete equality in capabilities between genders is not naturally and scientifically accurate. Women may not perform physically demanding work as men do, and they may not develop the same level of muscularity.

Point 2: Feminists advocating for equality are not expressing rocket science. They are simply stating that men and women should be complete equally. but not Ready to work rough work they should not use ""complete"" they should use the correct word ""cerebral"" opportunities.

Point 3: *If all girls are equal, they should not limit themselves to working only in comfortable environments* like air-conditioned spaces. Equality should extend to all fields, including labor-intensive jobs such as agriculture, construction, the military, mining, welding, plumbing, and mechanics and more... if they are not equal, we are agreeing they should work in comfortable environments. if they are forcing, we are complete equal they should agree to work in where difficult or muscular work have, we are not for that. then it's call Doglapan and for that we do not agree and ready."

anyways today s feminist are nothing but male hating degenerates who wants matriachy and are full lust to get men power without any responsiblity with ego issues, in short they are retard brainrots whom i dont care take seriously."

"Hey Dhruv, loved the intention and impact of this video. Because you do your research well, I also wanted to highlight how the word ""chappri"" has a casteist implication. Chhapris are a caste-oppressed community of people who make or mend chhappars, temporary roofs. Oppressed caste people try to look blingy to access the privilege of wealth but upper caste folk look down on this transformation and associate their caste to cringe. Maybe next time you can be more mindful about this language? Thanks. Continue your well intentioned work ЁЯСН"

Feminism is a silent poison which destroys the peace of society.. dhruv is just glorifying the positive side of feminism...
"they don't want equality they want equality with benefits, feminism its all women's advocacy not fot equality"

"I personally believe the core reason that nowadays we see movies like Thank You For Coming and Animal, and the overall negative stigma in society about Feminism is because most people consider Feminism and Matriarchy synonymous, they neglect the fact that it also talks about men's rights. They think Feminism was born to replace Patriarchy and give rise to a matriarchal society. Most are unaware that it's not the case............Thank You Dhruv Bhaiya for highlighting this clear difference and I think its high time people are made aware of this clear difference......................................."

"ItтАЩs is really sad that we as Indian (form global east) discussing about Ideas like Feminism and Patriarchy  which are totally western and totally silly Ideas.If we look at the  philosophyтАЩs  of east and west then there is a different, soul purpose of western peoples are to become successful while the sole purpose of Indian people was to achieve Moksh.there is a clear difference in purpose. So Indian patriarchy was totally different from western patriarchy.If we look at our past ,then our society was much more peaceful then western society.Patriarchy is all about devision of responsibility among men and women according to their natural capabilities ,ability and disabilities and for the over all betterment of the society.But yes there is a need to re-draw boundaries between men and women in the present context .Also sometime we sacrifice some of our goal (desire ) for our loving one , for our family, for our nation,for our society and no one should think bad about it. You are saying that Patriarchy brainwashed women but can u surely tell me you are not brainwashed or Imposing western Ideas over us.Feminism is naturally promoting Individualism and at the end it will once again make us Animals I am sure.

 Stop always seeing things for WESTERN LENSES."

"I'll tell you my take on this :-
Absolutely, all men and women are equal. And yes, i do believe that women should get equal rights, equal highest possible education, equal opportunities and equal pay as that of men.
BUT, i want to clarify the category of women that should be eligible to get this. Only those women, who are not married, or do not have a responsibility of the family, should pursue for their career. If a married women does a 9 to 5 job, who will take care of the kids? And who will look after the household work after all the tiredness of a 8 to 10 hour job? The work in a house is just as important as the work outside. Yes, it's a shame that women do not get enough credit and pay for managing the house, and we should talk on this matter, but this work is important for a family. And if you say that women can manage both, ask every women that if they get to choose only one, will they choose? The answer will be a yes.
A few years ago i heard a news from Bangalore that a women threw her handicapped son from her building because he was crying and distracting her from her job. No sane person would do this, and to stop this, the society has built some rules that applies to both men and women. I am not patriarchal, i am a feminist. Just not a irrational pseudo-feminist."

Males were going out of house since ages for hunting, food, education, work, business etc. Divorce/Separation idea was almost not  exist in society those days(before 1950). But why at 1960-2024 time divorce rate is so high ! 

When mature public(specially educated males) should follow feminist(equality) ideas, but why females are having reservation in trains/metros, why higher legal favor exists for females ? Where is feminism getting followed !

If you able to give logical answer of these, I will ask more.."

On paper Feminism might be about Men's right as it is about Women's right. But you don't see it on tbe ground. On paper Mr. Modi follows the consitution but we know that is not true. There are only a handful of feminists who you would see fighting for men's right. And people like Neha Dhupia are a real threat to feminism in India.

"While I agree to all your points but I think you misunderstood Neena Gupta's interview . It was a very good interview actually because she said men and women are not equal where she meant women needs men equally how men needs women. That interview was on women who say that they don't need men just because they want to show they are strong and don't need men at all in their life. The interview was never about equal rights , there's difference . Women and men should have equal rights but physically and biologically we are different and that we need each other."

"All points are absolutely valid. I have one more point to add. When parents start looking for a daughter in law, they have the list of qualities that they are looking for in the girl. But, they don't bother to teach their son the duties of a husband. The boy doesn't know the basic household chores. This is one of the reasons for fights between the couple after marriage."
"Dhruv rathee has been so much influenced by liberal, left wing ideology, I watch his videos because of the education purpose, but now he wants to influence the people by his political view, of course men and women needs to get equal opportunities, but are they. Equal, I mean look at the biological stand point are women do same labour work as men are capable do, men and women are different and in a healthy society they needs to do their own work, today's feminisn thought is that "" all men needs to die, they needs to do all the labour work and we are going to do all the easy work, and look at the western society, feminisn literally runing their society, Dhurv rathee is a Beta male who is highly influenced by this shitty ideology."

Bro the problems with feminism or should I say toxic feminism came up when women are asking for matriarchy on the name of feminism and another thing where there are unjustified unequal rights given to women than men and the way most women are misusing it and against with no other women is raising voice while men stand with women who suffers with anything wrong. That is what this feminism has turned into a toxic wave.

"What is feminism 
1)Demanding equal pay in sports like wtf do you generate the revenue even for example no 1 tennis player can't defeat men's ranked 100th tennis player
2) demanding equal ranks in army  do you expect to command a men full of boiling blood commanded by a girl
May be in some rare case
3) Demanding equal pay in physical jobs women body isn't developed to work equally same all over month  telling this with personal experience 
4) biologically men and women are different not in terms of just organs but some jobs and work requires secretion of particular hormones to give a rush or push 
I can give 100s more examples but instead of demanding equality why don't we just respect our imparity
Dhruvee stop going to extreme left"

"From my perspective, equality is an artificial ideology. But it doesn't mean it is bad. I think no one can achieve 100% equality. Somehow, one of the gender will dominant the other through the time being of human civilization. Still, I support equality. Nevertheless, I also believe that there can be no high without low, no good without bad, NO MAN WITHOUT WOMEN, and vice versa."
Dhruv bhai Salman rashdi ko legendary mat kaho please edit kardo.
"People and thier perfect answer on gender equality that no one asked. Feminism is just a dillusion bro!!! Just because your wife/gf supports feminism doesn't mean you'll label us men as wrong. Yes, women should get equal respect but comparing women to men doesn't make any sense. Why this generation wants to change' the thought of women. Why is it shameful to be a good housewife?? Can women work like us men ? We got muscle for the hard work, not to mob floors and do the dishes... we will help our wife when she needs help. 
Bro really thought we will agree to his opinion by talking about depression we men face to divert our thoughts but listen, guys... don't let stupid opinion loose your muscularity. Its a gift from God. Control your lust and work hard and marry a feminist woman who truly understand what her role is in your life. We nee emotional partner not a competition. 
I love your voides bro! No personal hate but i just don't agree with you on this topic."

"I don't have time to find fancy English words like ""normative conformity"", ""fallacy"", ""matriarchy"" blah blah blah to support my argument. But I hope if you understand simple Hindi and you have slightly higher sense than common sense, then you will understand what I am trying to say, so hear me out - 

Apko cool dikhne keliye hamesha society ke weaker side to hi support krna jaruri nahi hai. Agar saare aadmi mante hai ki aurat ko apne pati ko parmeshwar saman manna chaiye to kuch ""rational"" as you say and sensible mard bhi hote hai jo apni auratko devi ka roop mante hai. So instead saari ladies to ye sikhaya jaye ki patiko parmeshwar na mano kyu na ham saare aadmiyo ko sikhaye ki aap jitna parmeshwar hai utnahi appki aurat devi saman hai. Par nahi aap ko to jobhi cultural, traditional lagta hai aap fataak se usko logical angle deke logoko bahar ghasitne lagte ho. Aur rahi baat equal rights ki to haan aurato ko past mai bohot bhedbhav sehna pada hai but iska ye matlab nhi ki aurat har kaammai mard ki barabari kr sakti hai ya viceversa. Naturally/biologically mard stronger hote hai so physically harder tasks wo krte aa rahe hai aur aurat baki tasks jisme wo acchi hai wo krti aa rahi hai. Isko hamari bhasha mai efficiently ghar chalana kehte hai. Isme aapne pure aadmi prajatiko hi Villain ghoshit kr diyaЁЯШВHaan aaj ye sab baatein point nhi banati, (as aaj major kaam aurate equally better way mai kr sakti hai) but aajbhi agar hum jhagadne lage ki physically harder tasks like military, construction works mai auratoko equal rights de toh economically hamara desh collapse kr jayega. (App hi ne ekbaar apne video mai kaha tha - ""Ki jab ekbar desh ki prime minister ek aurat bani thi toh hume bhi pata hai kya hua tha"") Ye mai nahi bolra ye aapne bola tha. 
Rahi baat ghar ke kaamo ki(kyoki aapko to utne tak hi samaj aata hai) to jo nahi kamata wo gharke kaam kre agar dono kamatae hai to dono milke kare.

Rahi baat office mai equal pay ki, toh mere college mai iss saal saari ladkiya place ho chuki hai badi badi MNCs mai (jo hame hi pata hai ki most of them kaam krneke bajay companiyoka kaam badhayengi) aur college ke some of the best coders unplaced baithe hai. Kaise? ""Womens quota"", ""Equal rights"" ""Diversity hiring"" Tadaaaaa!!!! Aur agar koi aurat sachmai apne kaam mai aadmiyo se acchi hai to usko equal nahi aadmiyose jyada pay kro ye mai bhi maanta hun. 
Basically, aadmiyo ko sudharo naki Aurato ko pura western cultural mindset deke desh ka innocence mat khatam karo.

"But the fact is how many of these people are feminist? The definition of feminist only stayed in dictionary but not in reality. But these feminist mindset turns into matriarchy and patriachy thoughts. It's same way like we say *We believe in democracy*, but this democracy doesnt stand in any country... there isnt any country in the world which has 100% democracy. Democracy turns into some points of autocracy or dictatorship. 
What this feminism turns into?
1. Women are given full preference for Education and Opportunity. Govt provides women quota and zero cost for government exams. Corporates are mostly looking for women even if some women dont even deserve this.. this turns into a blackhole for some men who deserves this, Sometimes they dont even look for resumes. For so called 50% gender ratio, they ask silly questions from a women to provide a job.
2. Women have all the rights .. be it giving a false accusations or not. Lawyers and judges are too horny that they cant deny the fact that women can also be wrong.
3. Women get equal rights for everthing, yet they still want their husband to earn crazy amount of money. A man can marry a homeless girl but women wont even think if a guy earns less than a women.
4. Everyone has seen feminism during war. Men were bound to stay and protect their motherland and women were endulged with men of other nations to get settled. At that time feminist attitude of a women turned into patriarchy.
5. Women are  provided with all benefits of public transport, free tickets, free seats, free arguments and also love going to protest for not getting any benefit?

THIS IS FEMINISM... Real feminism means giving all the importance to a women..The point is why they innovated GENDER EQUALITY to a FEMINISM maybe because some men wants women to get attracted ??  if you point out these points then these women's feminist attitude will kick in yoooo!"
Thank you so much
"At least, there is someone who can reciprocate my feelings. I still remember when the nirbhaya case started, my dad read the newspaper which stated that kids should know what woman is, he used to give me sex education and why this case was no different from before cases. I really understand now what patriarchy is and how people only objectify women. This is a shareable and must know topic for younger generations. But the reality is people don't want to be misjudged because of peer pressure.. Man, get a life, it's your life and you should decide your life. I blame myself because i was under the same pressure for a long time until i decided "" bas ho gaya"". Now I'm happier than ever. Thank you Dhruv for bringing this topic upfront without any fear of people judging you. Keep spreading positivity and there are countless people to back you."
"It is totally disappointed me you didn't even talk about what issues men facing
As a human men are still struggling to get basic human rights and protection from constitution
Such as 
1. Sexual harrasment laws should be gender neutral
2. If a boy watches or capture half naked or naked images of girl will get 7 years jail but if girl does same with boy then no punishment
3. If a boy disrobe any girl he will get at least 7 year jail but if girl does same thing to boy then no punishment
4.If a girl make promise to marry and had relation with boy & at the time of marriage deny to marry him no punishment for her but if boy did same he will face rape charges, 10 years of jail and only on girls statement immediately arrest
5. If a wife had sexual relation with man other than her husband then no punishment for her instead if on this ground if husband ask divorce he has to pay alimony (only if she is in live in relationship with her boyfriends during marriage then alimony can avoided)if man does the same he can land in jail in 498a due to mental cruelty cause by his affairs to his wife and need to pay alimony to her.
5.if you live with your wife but didn't had sex. And wife gets pregnant by other man still its your responsibility to pay for child.
6.If wife does physical or mental cruelty to husband he can only divorce but still has yo pay alimony to her. If husband does same wife can complaint 498a on entire family can arrest. And gets the alimony.
7. If any girl accused you for rape only on her statement you can arrested and if case turn out to false no punishment for her (in some cases court applies nominal fine)
8. Stalking is offence only punishment for boys 
9. Verbal abuse , physical abuse , emotional abuse, econmical abuse , mental abuse all this can only happens to women only and only boys can punished as per constitution

So if you consider yourself a Faminist, equal Rights supporter then why you vant support equal rights for men also."
"I think it would have been more appropriate if you would have also included how bad some people use this word to exploit men and run away from responsibilities.

Genders are not equal, both have different roles and responsibilities, Non-Gender people can't exist. In every living creature, there are genders with different abilities according to science. Else we can just stop our Human Generation, unless humans discover a method for Artificial Human Generation. Nature is nature. I totally agree with how some women's rights are ruined in our societies in Pakistan & India, even mens rights are ruined by women sometimes. While we also have to accept the fact that the world is authorized&controlled by both men & women in a totally different Direct/Indirect ways logically/scientifically/historically. And the Most of the Patrialcal thinking is from nature & fits in it... Is dhuruv also Priotrical person, why he thinks that he should make this video as a man? I mean why most Men  raise the voice about feminism, women have their own voice as if the genders are equal. And while you talk about cheating Spouses, use Science & Nature to figure that why is it Ok for men & why not for women to have multiple men."

"You had quite emphasis on anti feminist women for some reason . I mean they too deserve same opportunities ,protection and integrity as human ,even if we don't align with them.  Also feminism is supposed to be focused on women not men. Men are strugglikg because of their ego ,they don't need services from feminists while belonging from oppressive class. Men can't be feminists Feminism isn't philosophy for everyone but movement for only women"

"There is one point I have to disagree with.

Men and women can't be divided into  teams. Actually atleast women can.

In my personal life I have seen that when push comes to shove women regardless of their cultural linguistic racial and religious differences unite and come together as a gender.

Men have never done that historically and not even now.
Men will still always be divided based on the above mentioned groupings. In fact Men have killed each other over these issues. They have even killed each other over a woman as well.

But I rarely see women fighting and killing each other over a man."

Best video ...thank u dhruv rathee for such logical explanation about feminism тЭд Some men really will never understand TRUE meaning on feminism
"Feminism is not equality of women along with men, Western civilization is suffering massively from feminism and hook up culture/sexual revolution, feminism started with equal rights but was scam to overpower men, after lowering wage gapes and rising the production, inflation rised and two income household became normal, after women entering workforce, women started more educated and out earning men, women don't need men of their equal they need atleast equal or more more superior, women became more masculine, non agreeable, dominant, carrer oriented with non stay home mom, LGBTQ, men and women are called same in western civilization along with Scandinavian countries but they are the most unhappy, broken marriages, single mother household with fatherless society. Feminism indoctrinates women to be strong and independent without a need of a man. Watch fresh and fit podcast for enlightment."

"What about every law that discriminates against gender? Why do not you discuss the numerous laws in our nation that are being abused? Even cricket players and celebrities like Shikhar Dhawan and Muhammad Shami are not safe. What about the law that the present administration passed in the name of feminism? I am in favor of gender equality, but in the name of that cause, society is actually moving quickly toward increasing prejudice and polarization. For example, the alimony legislation was created to safeguard women's futures, but it is currently being abused, and the same is true of other laws passed by the present administration. Generally speaking, these laws do more harm to society than good, as they do not promote equality or harmony."

5:52 what makes you think that is not ideal to believe but yours is. Nothing is ideal. Period
My parents are not that educated but I'm proud of them because as a boy I'm told to respect and treat girls equally
"Dhruv there can only be equality among males and females only if the laws are also equal... If a man slaps a woman he can be jailed but if a woman slaps a man no action can be taken ? If a woman cheats the law wont take action against her but if a man cheats he can be jailed for causing adultery. Why does a man has to pay alimony even after getting divorced.. etc etc.. if u want equality then make the laws equal for botb of them why does they get preference? Why there is seat for only women in metros , trains ,bus etc why not for men ? Unless and until laws are equal for both there can be no equality, Alpha male chappri bolo ya kuch bhi bolo ur nonsense agenda wont work everytime."

This video direct slap to every man who is not a feminist. Neha Dhupia didn't say anything wrong in that episode.
It's not about Feminism or Patriarchy. It's about Exploitation of your Rights. No matter If You're a Man or Woman. You're not human if you're misusing your Rights and make someone Suffer.
"15:10 
The man who does express only his negative emotions to his friends shall be considered weak.
Howling or Crying, especially in front of your friends (exception: your time-tested friend) is a sign of weakness for men !
THOSE CRYING MEN ARE WEAK !

I hold such strong opinions as I'd some idea about STOICISM
Men who only cry and shares their Feelings generally focuses on the problem and not on the solution.
We men must be a Rock on whom any closed one in distress can come to us for solution. A rational Man would rather search for the solution rather than the problem as he knows 'cyring wouldn't help him ; crying wouldn't give him solutions ; crying wouldn't change anything'. 
A Man must search for the RAY OF HOPE and not on the darkness he's traped in. It's okay to get a bit demotivated but it mustn't extinguish the Fire of Optimism in us by Crying.

If you are reading this comment :-
Go and Search about STOICISM and ZENO OF CITIUM to truly understand what I mean to say."

I m always criticised for being a feminist. People around me think a feminist woman look down upon a man. How stupid. How can my equal rights disrespect the males?
Bhtreen . тЭдтЭд
Feminism se zyada pseudo feminism is more problematic in our society. Most don't want to take accountability for their actions and try to play the victim card and bash out the opposite gender for literally existing so as to validate their false sense of superiority.
"Adding to what Dhruv described in the video - (1) - There should be ""Mother Name"" as well in all the govt. & legal documents and not just limited to Father Name, as now things have changed. (2) Single motherhood must be embraced, as many unplanned pregnancy cases are there, where a man leaves women but women want to give birth to the child. (3) After marriage, women is supposed to leave their parents and live with in laws. This is also part of patriarchy - This way only in-laws are taken care in old age, what about women's parents who are also getting old. This indirectly increases the ""need"" of having son in the family. I am totally against this culture of leaving ones house and women scrificing living with parents. It is husbands responsibility as well to take care of his in laws, marriage doesn't work one way :)"
No feminist woman would want to have a partner shorter than her. It's reality.
Can u make a proper reply video for asaduddin owaisi recent speech??

"13:06
What the Buddha said is right. We mustn't counter their slangs with slangs or counter anger with anger.
13:20
But it's not the way either to silently tolerate the abuses given to us. The other side might cause Physical Harm to us or cause harm in terms of our property.
Instead we must consult about the solution of the problem with a calm-head while ignoring the abuses and anger from other side.
Also we must try to calm th other side down to make it focus on the solution rather than the problem to not escelate any form of Physical Abuse

The Fire must be Extinguished with Ice.
We must neither extinguish the Fire with Fire nor to leave it to Combust and to cause harm."

The true definition of feminism is what I am with. Gender should never play a role in stuff like what career you do, how much you get paid, etc. What it should depend on is how you are as a person (e.g., your pay should be determined by how productive you are, and no parallels should be drawn with gender in this matter).

Really helpful dhruv. thanks for uploading such content..
"Men and women 100% should get equal rights, but to be said that they are exact equal and same is wrong imo ,

DonтАЩt you think when a person is engaged in a fight a man can communicate much more rationally than a woman who are often succumbed by emotions and need at least few hours to calm down before talking with their emotions aside.

Also, at times of emergency, whether it be losing your house keys or if a close person to you is having a heart attack infront of you. I believe many women in those situations freezes instead of taking quick actions at those critical hours which is what most men do.

My thinking is not influenced by the society , it comes from experiences. IтАЩve had few exes in my past where iтАЩve noticed they canтАЩt talk in senses when situation is heated. And there was one time when a slingbag of ours got lost in a foreign country which held all our passports and important docs, not to forget a horrific memory of my father getting heart attack at 11pm infront of me and my elder sister."

"I would like to add a few more points to this video. 
1. Masculinity is not what These movies show and should face criticism.
2. Toxic feminism exists and is overpowering the true meaning of feminism.  This is why some male criticize women for getting more influenced by these kinds of Bollywood movies. 
3. It's not Gender equality rather it is Gender rights equality. 
4. There are so-called chapri alpha females also whose sole purpose is to hate men. 
5. Man hating is getting so strong under the name of feminism and yet there are no such videos criticizing them. 
I will embrace my musculanity and females should embrace femininity. We both are a very essential part of a society and both should work for the betterment of the society. ЁЯСНЁЯП╜"

"Recently you did a video on feminism but in that you never mentioned regarding ipc laws which are made against menтАж
I hope you touch upon that topic in future because this a massive issue which no one has the guts to talk about openly"
"The video seems impressive at first glance, and it's nice to hear, but it's quite detached from reality. The idea of equality sounds wonderful until you hit a moment of realization that you've been duped, and there will come a time when you'll find yourself reflecting on it with tears. If simply listening to this person brings you comfort and makes you smile, it's time to step back and question it. That comfort zone is a slippery slope into a world of delusions, distancing you further from the truth. You unwittingly become the ideal target for marketers, transforming into the very product they sell.

Every time you encounter new information, if you just paused to critically analyze it, to sift through it with your own intellect, to research and ponder deeply from various perspectives, you'd shield yourself from the corporate world's hypnotic grasp. If reading this irks you or gets under your skin, it's a sign that the corporate spell has begun its work on you, and you've become ensnared. But once the veil is lifted and you see the reality for what it is, there's no turning back. Stay alert and watch out for these snares."

"I swear I've heard a lot of people talking about feminism.  But what Dhruv has told is absolutely true and logical too.  If you understand deeply, he has explained it very well.  But still a lot of people won't understand.  For example, what Neena Gupta has said in the podcast, she just said it.  I did not expect her to say this to women of her age, even though she had already given birth to a child at a young age and raised it alone.  Yet look at her talking like this when I saw this video of her saying this.  Man and woman are not equal.  She too have gone mad.  But now that Dhruv has posted this video, I like it very much, thank you."
I dont hate  equality in women and but in brief  some women are taking feminism in very bad way
"Hi Dhurv, you didn't talk about women use the Law as a weapon to dominate men with false accusation. I think it's time to talk about men abuse by women using unfair advantages of the very law which was made to protect them."
"U mentioned hindu parishad, how come did you not touch Muslim families and their mentality? What about Christian thoughts? Such biasness in your videos are sickening and tiring"
Excellent Dhruv
"Females don't want equal rights in hardworking jobs like sea oil rigs, construction works, special operation soldiers. They want jobs in places like politics or high paying desk jobs. Because they are clearly aware of their physical and mental capablities. They want to earn money for themselves while also want to have a husband who protect them, have higher paying jobs than them, provide for them while also remain loyal to them. A woman can beat a man follow like creep and basically do anything and its called embracing feminism. But the moment the roles are reversed 10 years jail, or big fines are thrown. A woman while physically much weaker than man ,also knowing that she can be easily raped or killed at night still doesn't take husband, brother, or any trustable person along with her. And when she gets raped (which is common) she blames all of men. So there are numerous factors from which it can be concluded that woman being physically and mentally weaker than men want a higher, more powerful and more dominant position over men. (Basically rule and take every advantage (like a pet)). That's what this modern toxic feminism is all about. That's what you supporting for in comment section. And that's what couldn't be cleared in above video properly. If you find any of my sentence wrong or injustified search the same youtube, you will find plenty examples to prove my objective right."

"The problem is with the representation of modern wave of feminism. There are a lot of issues here. 
1. Feminism was about equality for both genders , but none of the feminists ever support any of the men's issues. 
2. Feminism has turned into 'As a girl I'll do whatever and society shouldn't judge' . Examples are , cheating , abusing men etc . unfortunately they can get away with it as there are no rules in place for the protection of men. False dowry cases, false sexual abuse cases etc. 
3. Feminism now is literally hating men. Countless activists and social media influencers say outright that they hate men and they should all off themselves. 

Real feminism should be given a different name now because it is ruining the reputation of the term. The power has shifted to the women who care to use them. And ofcourse this all just in big cities and I feminism is actually needed in rural places where women are treated harshly and not whatever today's feminism has turned into."

"Correct me if I'm wrong Dhruv is that feminism actually practised? That's what feminism might be but It doesn't run like that. I can't say much on everyday  India but overall around the world sadly they apply the opposite. A women gets favoured just based on her gender and everyone believes her based on her gender. Not men. Men are always ignored and sidelined in majority of cases which then makes them turn to the chapri style(unacceptable btw). Most men now literally feel threatened by women as if they say anything that she don't agree with, you are done for big time in society. Men problems will go on sadly as the women are attracted always to the latter. Nice guys finish last sadly. Feminism of the 90s is actually what makes sense to me but now, this feminism is more of an anti-men movement as these girls can't even define the word  ""misogyny"" when asked upfront."

IF MEN AND WOMEN ARE SAME REMOVE THE CATEGORY FOR MEN AND WOMEN. 
CONSIDER A NEW ONE ""HUMAN"" IN EVERY THING IN LIFE.

MEN are good in physical activity and WOMEN are good mental activity. We should embrace each other strength and fill each other weakness.

AGAIN MEN AND WOMEN ARE ""equal"" NOT ""same""."

You have my respect but somewhere these feminist girls never settle for unemployed men nor did it ever liberate any male from the patriarchal things u said... Not height not salary... Every girl who is educated and is feminist is never settling with a low salary short guy they still want that and the rights... And also really sorry but u forgot how feminism is used to actually torcher males using laws only... So please if u are serious... Make a video highlighting where feminism succeeded and where it miserably failed and turned misandry... If u can criticize those misogynistic films criticize misandry songs of Taylor Swift... Also none of the feminist page ever talks about why suicide rates are higher in males or about the false accusations stuff and wrong child support things... See these are logical things which I want u to really answer if u are trye feminist and if it's really good. Also when there is a criticism for misandry things like lyrics of Taylor Swift... They always say u are getting jealous as female is getting on top and not males... So where did this logic come from? Means using misandry and getting on top doesn't give u any right to do that stuff... Its wrong condem it... And of true feminism society went too ahead in many terms now crushing males... Specially the laws... Name any one law a female doesn't have which male has... And please talk about the special things that in today's world also a rape can be done only by males and not females... There's no protection for men in laws... Also how still books like how to control ur husband like a dog are selling freely and vice versa is critised heavily... I don't say feminist support such wrong things but they don't even do anything against it... So somewhere ur point that feminism is for males is just a crap

"Ask a feminist woman to apply for a job in coal mine , or a iron ore extraction unit, or high tension line repair job. Why in the world feminist looks a supervisor job in an IT department or a software company. Really no body is preventing any girls to apply for a mining job . Answer is simple equal opportunity can be given to everyone , not equality. I am not in favor of patriarchy but I donтАЩt think destroying the mom + dad and kids family will be a very progressive idea. I will also encourage you to visit different industries and universities take a statistical look on how many women apply for what kind of jobs and do graduations in what field of study. Women and men are different biologically and thatтАЩs why we have a society to begin with."
"I agree with every point of yours 
But, you should make a video on how some women misuse the constitution to their benefit
Like those divorce, consent type cases 
It is imp for everyone to know that how some women are destroying male rights and lives too"
"I'm a feminist but not a pseudo feminist.
There are many tasks that a man can easily do and there are some tasks a woman can easily do.
Yeah as per the definition of feminism:-
""Feminism is the belief that women deserve equal social, economic, and political rights and freedoms.""
I agree with that but i believe all tasks cannot be done by men and all tasks cannot be done by women that's why they are different.
I do respect all females and i also support higher education of all females.
But i hate those pseudo feminists who say ""all men are dog"" or ""world will be better without men"" or ""a woman can do whatever a man can do""
Or ""we dont want men for living"".
Also i hate patriarchy as well because in a society as woman should be respected just like an other man. 
Thanks Dhruv Rathee For Clarifying The Concept."
Very informative and interesting program thanks for sharing the knowledge ЁЯСН
"Thank you for summarizing your research and inspiring others to do their own research to learn more by providing the references.
Clarity on the definition of feminism is one thing but mindset of equality is a whole new story. By knowing the definition , alfa males will not change or will not stop tagging 'equal' females as feminist. Nowadays, the word feminist is used to tag certain women's who try or does thing's equally or better than men's. So they will use a different word now.
The mindset needs to change and it's a long process. I wonder why alfa males still talk about alfa males supiority when they work under women's in almost everywhere. So funny."

"The Problem with Subcontinent Feminism is the it only call for equal rights but not for equal responsibilities. Here in the video Dhruv pointed few cases where Men were at the receiving end & He simply said No Feminists supported the women acts,  That's is the hypocrisy, when these Pseudo feminists call for crimes against women, they not only criticize but demand punishment where as in crimes against men you'll find no condemnation from any feminists. One can't get away with this by simply saying no feminist supported it,  All must display same behavior for crimes and wrongdoings. So this hypocrisy must end, only then feminists will look true in their demands."
"I think you forgot 1 thing to mention:
What about the marketing campaign that shows that, women should look like this and men should like this
what about those campaigns, which shows that make up is only for women, infact women must do make up
There are many more things in this: just getting equal rights is not the solution. equality should be our inherent nature and equality means for all.
People who actually belives in equality, should promote their thoughts but not to gain popularity or promote films like some celebrities do."
"But what about the laws against men? ....... 
What you just explained it's seemed like a beautiful theory. The reality feels different........"

2. This simp doesn't know what he is talking about. He has been conditioned by toxic feminism where men are blamed for their own problems and the problems of women. Women are not be blamed for anything but just praised for everything."
Very well portrayed and good insights here. But let's not forget the facts that nowadays Feminism is being misused as a Tool or weapon. If its really about Equal rights for both genders why give a name which is gender specific.

Patriarchy k definition me kahi par ye nahi likha hai ki тАЬaadmi ka control hona auraton k uparтАЭ galat interpretation dene ki ky zarurat hai. Very disappointed. Literally my brain is hurting. He talks so idealistically. Reality doesn't care about these things. There are reasons for the way things are in this world. So now you can't even punch someone if someone humiliates you in front of your wife. Meaning you don't have dignity. What kind of cuckster pussy advice is that. Tu hi kar bhai apni gf yaa biwi ko tolerate unke cheat krne pe. Bohot se ladke h jinka abhi bhi dimaag thikane pe h jo apni partner k cheating ko tolerate nhi krenge or jo ki sahi bhi h. You are clearly promoting the matrix agenda here men should cry more. They should act on their feelings. that's why you get rapists and acid attackers because men who are vulnerable to their emotions who can't control their emotions are dangerous to society and that's a fact.

"i think one point missing pls provide some rights for men on fake rape case, dowery and make divorce process fast because now days womens misuse this law for money. so providing equal rights for men in this law to save men life if you are true femnist you support equilty."
"Equality of opportunity is ok but equality of outcome is totally unfair ,  we in india have separate reservations for women , in jobs educations etc we have reserved seats in public transport even free transport , we have women centric law in this country where women shamelessly abuse it almost 74 rape cases were false last year almost 98% of domestic dowry and abuse cases were false many  have committed suicide due to it their family also suffer , but this point is suppressed in the world from many years even dhruv didn't cover it ЁЯШВ

Solution : 
1) remove all reservations 
2) bring equal centric laws
3)stop alimony dahej dowry 
4) Stop forcing women empowerment agenda in our throats every where for eg ( movies for eg she hulk , four more shots ) let people enjoy things the way they are not everything is needed to be about women
+ 
Why do we need feminism in 2023
1) women have more rights and opportunities than men 
2) gender pay gap is debunked thousands of time"

99% women don't want unemployed men to marry ...this is truth not patriarchal thought I think
"Our main stream media is senseless ethic less along wid rising unemployment makes the migration of rural areas people town tier 3 tier 2 cities 
 females & males migrate to metro cities where they act like animals those males who r sincere check the complete background of female  before getting married bcoz these days I have seen so many reports that males & females from  mostly in age 13 to 30 they just busy in taking gifts money food articles & physical intercourse only before marriage no loyalty towards any one they change boyfrnds or partners like clothes so don't send males & females outside your area unless very necessary
And get a female as ur wife who has a character & loyalty
Adultry has become a common phenomenon in India & Asia so talking about culture is waste   marriage is no longer a pious thing it's just an agreement which legislature have to pass in UCC but females while making a boyfrnd live in partner or getting married choose a wise prudent man not only Money & physical attraction that will lead to tarnish lives other Thing this generation have to understand the Loyalty is most important factor of Life"

You failed to hide your emotions, to be specific, your hatred towards men.

"What a stupid example of giving right of voting to a normal man and a disabled person...... I agree only if you say everyone should be given his own rights (justice)...... the philosophy of equal right has no sense because everybody deserve separate rights and implementing equal rights means injustice with the right of another person... It could be understand by your own example of giving right of voting, would you allow a child to cast his vote before 18??? If not then kindly say why you are making inequality between him and others? Obviously your answer will be like ' the child has no right for casting vote until he reaches 18 and here it becomes more obvious that the concept of equality is totally wrong we should replace it with the concept of justice, so where there is justice there  you wouldn't need to beg for your rights....."

Taking about hipocracy is not what u are doing same in the video  not talking about Matriarchy more as your patrarcial thinking in the way as in the near future the contend is judge by someone and u might have to give apology. And the reason the people dont like femisim is not the reason u justyfy its just lack of education between the matrarcy and feminin society . Education is the basic needed to mantain the equality . Neither matrarchy nor the patriarchy taking your contend for 1st time and not taking it again .  Reason u create contend dont provide education. And if u think critisizing the other work to gain view do u know what it is called exploitation. crater who wanna me alpha like those owls out there

"Men and women are not comparable when it comes to evolutionary roles, i.e.(1000 years back) one is designed to protect the family and bring food for the family, while the other's role is to take care of the house and nurture the kids. 

But considering the present scenario, where we live in a world so advanced, ( Food and shelter is not even a point of concern for the majority population) there is a problem our evolution has no answer to. Now the differentiating trait of a man ( Being strong & backbone of the family) is no use.

Any activity/role/function should be first analysed if it can be done by a man or woman. If the answer is yes then both should be considered equal without discrimination. 


Equality for a job, which considers both sex equal."

Generalisation is a big problem.
"When feminism does not explicitly oppose racism, and when anti-racism does not incorporate opposition to patriarchy, race and gender politics often end up being antagonistic to each other, and both interests lose."
I am not patriarchal but somewhere feminism is also not good

"Patriarchy to padri, mulla ya pandit hota hai na, isme purush pardhan kese huwa"
"When Indian men are not even allowed to file a case of domestic violence or sexual harassment, how can I believe that feminism is for equality?? Where are the feminists campaigning for men's right to protection against something as basic as domestic violence? 
When the government tried to make the rape and sexual harassment laws gender-neutral, it was the Indian feminist who prevented the government from doing so."
"Aaj kal k bollywood actress ladkyon ko yeh  batati hai ki feminism ka mtlb hai ki, ladkiyan bahar jao, independence k naam pe char jaga muh maro apni value down karo, phir batao ki its my choice, cant accept my past, itna judgemental kaise ho....

"The statement men and women can be equal is fundamentally wrong. There can be equity among men and women, but never equality. Dhruv very cleverly equated the anatomy of both the genders, but what about the physiology ? 
There are several fundamental differences in the biology of men and women which enables them for functions specific to their gender. Men and women have evolved differently to fulfill different purposes, otherwise they would have been the same organism. 

Atlast women empowerment should never go against the order of the nature. Otherwise The catastrophe can already be seen in the society."
Men and women are equal in aggregate and own their responsibility. This is a very complex topic.

I am not feminist but the advocator of women's right.
i respect Dhruv's opinion but still society is not equal and boys also face discrimination in many places......even in school all the teachers have a soft corner for girls.....I know that girls still face discrimination and all i want to say is that our society is not going on the right path.....

"If a girl doesn't want to marry an unemployed man, it's her choice.

People pretend to be feminist but actually most of them are fake feminist.

They just want to exploit women in the name of feminist or equality

Men and women are not same physically and emotionally too

God has created them different and blessed men and women with their different powers.

The real feminism is when a men and women works according to their ability and capabilities.

I wish every people came to know this.

"ItтАЩs not about ""Equal Right"". Rather it should have been ""Appropriate Rights"". 

For example: Suppose only one chair available in a waiting lounge and 3 people are demanding the chair. One of them is lame & the other two are fit & fine. Now who is more eligible for sitting in it?

Equal Right: Everyone has equal right to sit there.

Appropriate Right: The lame should be given the chair.

By the way, to the so called faminists, if it is appropiate to have paid maternal leave, what wrong the father did. He also should have paternal leave, no matter the company gets busted. After all equal rights matters."

"It is said that to a hammer everything looks like nail. To the imbecilic narrator of this video everything that is distasteful is ""patriarchy"". This channel is perfect for impressionable teenagers to feel good about themselves. The narrator reduced everything to the definition, rather than, actions of political ideology that is feminism. Feminism is a Marxist adjacent ideology that purports that human history must be seen from the perspective of battle between sexes (where men were oppressors and women were oppressed). 

If it was only about equality then it would have been a redundant ideology because the concept liberty and equality predates feminism by centuries. Feminists seek power. They claim that every disparity at powerful places were caused by discrimination. One would find feminist clamouring about number of women in board rooms but they are conspicuously silent about any and all fields where women outnumber men."

"Every single men around me are so full of patriarchal thoughts including my family and friends. On top of that, women are also like that. Recently i was very down and depressed about this. Its highly appreciated to make such eye opener videos. Calling those alpha sigma males ' chappri influencers' is the best reply to them. I dont know how difficult is it to have  respect for one another in this world. Its such a simple thing to do. Anyways, i am happy to see a man creating such video.

"Agreed to the most part of your views on feminism .. But it would have been great if u have also discussed more about FemiNAZIs in here .. "" a situation where a woman takes disadvantages of her being a woman"" .. I will give you an example... The case of Jasleen and Sarabhjeet.. where that girl accused the boy of harrasment... But in the end it turned to be a false implications ... While the social media trial was going on.. everyone ( politician like Kejriwal, actress like Sonakshi) publically praised that girl and shamed the boy...  They boy got terminated from his job and was called rapist... While the girl after realising she is going to loose I'm the court happily got settled in Canada... And didn't attend any hearing in court ...!! Now today the case is been ruled in favour of the boy .. but he lost his 11 years and had suicidal thoughts during that period .. 


My point being... If toxic masculinity is a problem...  Then femiNAZIS need to be viewed in the same lens...

Hope I made sense...

"Patriarchy is the overall system on which our societal norms and stereotypes are based. The┬а patriarchy system┬а is what defines muscularity and femininity .┬а Patriarchy tells us that masculine people should be strong ,they should not cry and be ready to do anything that is deemed feminine and most importantly masculine people shouldn't be feminine at all . Then it tells us conversely that feminine people are overly emotional ,that they cannot be part of masculine realms .They're dramatic┬а because of their gender but opposite of masculine people feminine people are always┬а there to support masculine people either as mother ,sister wife or uterus . We're taught that┬а being masculine is good and and┬а desirable while being┬а feminine is enforcement┬а┬а


Example that shows the patriarchy existing in our society is "" society blaming girls for wearing short or comfortable clothes"" and another example is ""world making fun of the guy who cries"" but 80% of suicide are done by guys so, to make society Happy we need to realise that feminism is beneficial for man too but a lot of people think feminism is hating men but ┬а feminism is about taking down patriarchy and it's oppressive norms ,Even though men are the one who benefit from patriarchy the most yet they are┬а victimised to an extend. I mean ""it's like misogyny┬а being a two way street"" . The definition of masculine doesn't allow men┬а to share feelings so┬а they end up bottling up their emotions . They have no way to seek help for and they don't know how to deal with emotions .Society labels showing emotion or tears as feminin things.


┬аundoubtedly the patriarchy system is a system in┬а which┬а men hold the power and┬а women are largely excluded but still patriarchy oppresses all of us."

And then all the religion based hate would also stop 
Where muslims hate non muslims when non muslim majorly hindu and Christian guy marry Muslim girl 
And hindu christian hate when muslim marry hindu christian girl...
So this problem would also solve 
If male dominance gets ended 
We jst need to make sure that both males and females continue lineage by giving one child surname of father and other child with mother surname....
It would make sure that both are equally continuing lineage

"Feminists talking about equality should be asked about their contribution in in building the infrastructure and things they use like roads, buildings, bridges, electricity, food, gadget etc... they will shut the mouth and vanish instantly...
All they want is high position in companys built by men.

But equal pay should be paid to equal work. Every job should be open for everyone irrespective of gender. Equal rights should be given to everyone irrespective of gender. Also working women should take responsibility of her family expenditure, instead of saving all their wages and expecting men to work and spend for their family expenditure."

"Excellent video Dhruv sirтЭд. But I think you should have highlighted one more point , that how women missuse Feminisms . I know you did mention about Neha dhupia etc. but what I want to point out is, this video would have been a lot more relevant if it was released a decade earlier. 

   In today's society. Just tell me one area where women are getting paid lesser than men for exactly same job profile given that she's making the same impact on the jobЁЯШв. Don't have ans right?? Woh you might be thinking about sports section?? Let me tell u, it's indeed true women are getting lesser pay than a man if we think about sports like football. But Here's the point I mentioned earlier that ,""given they are making same impact"". In case of football the payment players get comes from total revenue generated. The total revenue generated in women's football is a lot lot lower than men. But women are actually getting paid around 20% of the revenue generated while men are getting almost 7%. Still many women are like ,""don't tell me reasons , I just want same pay as men"" . Didi, u will surely get paid the same if you are worth the same ammount. 

Sir should have put more emphasis on how most of today's generation of girls went around calling themselves as Feminist but in reality they all have matriarchy centered idealsЁЯШв. They'll just go arround doing and saying toxic things about men and try to gather sympathy by Playing victim card.

WE WANT A VIDEO ON PAKISTAN'S POLITICAL CRISIS!!
One video for pakistan election
"How stupid is that if u consider looking after a house hold a less noble or prestigiuos job for a woman than to be an Astraunaut.
If all the females do job along with men who ll take of the house or children or old parents.
Thats why if u see the birth rates of the western countries are nose diving. And there is no one to take care of the elderly and there r lots of jobs available for old care because they dont want to make a family they only focus on their careers. 
If a man is able to perform in the society and get to a noble position in the society thats because of his mother and family. His mother provides him emotional and physical work support and his father provides faniancial support throughout his education.
All success that we men have achieved is because of our women, they r the entity behind it.
Man and Woman are equal in society but have different roles.
I love a bollywood movie related to this topic.
Addition: I didnt say that to look after a family is only female's job but my point is that they can do it better as compare to a man. If a man does household and a woman earns thats also the same thing there is nothing wrong in it but in majority women are gentle, soft, emotional and men are hard ,rational and less emotional so they perform certain task better and fails in certain jobs . 
Now imagine a man as an air host there would be a war in the sky."

Thank you Dhruv for clearing the understanding of Feminism. I get it now. Its misunderstood in many ways.
"So many examples of Hindu & Christian society, Not even one example of any Muslim women, are they not oppressed, are they treated fairly in their society. Do they even know the word Feminism exists in society. I don't think Hindus need to be taught how to respect women, in our culture we worship them. I don't know why people give lectures on any foreign subject, which has very little relation  to our country but is portrayed as a serious issue like something is wrong in our culture in relation to that. Yes we are not equal, in my culture women are far more superior."
Soy boy
I want Dhruv Rathee to read about Prophet Muhammad.... He was the first to talk about Feminism
"At the risk of being called a ""misogynist"" here's my two cents as a socially conservative guy:
There are many people who don't oppose equal rights but oppose the way feminism manifests in society.
Everyone talks about misogyny and it is called out which is a good thing but misandry is heavily downplayed.
And many women resort to both feminist and patriarchal ideas depending on whichever suits them at the specific situation.
Many immoral and toxic behaviors are often promoted in the name of feminism using the argument of ""it's her choice"".
If you feminists really think that your ideology is good then in that case your marketing is terrible.
And by the way I'm not a misogynist. I also think so-called alpha males and incels are cringe.
I respect women who respect men and society as a whole as well as their own bodies. It's as simple as that."

was expecting to hear about Hindu code bill and the protest to stop it.
Feminisam means a person who belive equall rights of both male and female
"Equal rights is okay, but what about people's who abuse those equal rights, ie lady slapps a man and calls be feminist, or she cheats and says you've cheated me in the past now I've done the same, I have equal rights? Uska kya? What about such peoples with such mindset? We want an equal world but these people don't deserve because they abuse, I wish the day come when they all are treated equally with you and me alive and you'll realise why they shouldn't have gotten equality, cheers!! We can't control everyone"
"When I was growing up, boys in my friends' group called me 'bro' and I used to be very happy thinking it was an honor to be one of them. It was my unconscious conditioning that girls are inferior. Thankfully as a woman, my thoughts have changed and I am proud to be a woman."

The life and event of a girl born in poor, middle class , rich family and its goes on like different ethnicity and believe system can't be same and her behaviour pattern will be according that. So her reaction to any situation will differ . So, it's all what is called life . Its same for everyone. People need to learn to expect accordingly and develop a sense to read these patterns."

"I think people need to understand that Feminism is not same all around the world. Feminism in US/UK is not the same in India. Western world have went pass Patriarchy from very long time and the mess that Westerners have made of Feminism shows what happen when you support a movement which no longer is needed. Their Feminism is not about equal rights but only men being good are Black or those who aren't white and women should be in place of power because they should, and not because if they are qualified of it. 

But India is completely different country. Someone saie that only in India, you can see the most wealthiest of men and also the most poorest of men. Similarly there are many women who don't only have the right from constitution but also support from Society to live their life as they see fit. As well women who still having the right are restricted to education, Job and deciding their own future."

"Why not simply call it ""Equal Rights"" as it originally was. And why are the demands of the feminists limited to Tier 1 positions?
You certainly provided with the example of the legends who were working over the cause that cannot be challenged. But the trend, the recent leaders, their demands (that are limited to certain positions), the hipocricy, the way is now been positioned has formed a new perspective to the definition. A video over how Women are spoling the actucual notion of the 'ism' could bring much clarity."

"As a psychologist, I  agree with Neena jee. Pregnancy is a huge factor and differentiator. In Europe (western society) many men leave as soon as the woman is pregnant. The woman can not leave the child cause he/she came out of her body. So how can you make it equal where the woman is now stuck and thus  sacrificing everything. So stop making these kinds of equality statements and be honest. Moreover I highly recommend everyone to go through the full podcast of Neena jee then you will know why she said that."

It's All About Our Worst Society ЁЯТФ
"If Feminism does mean egual rights for women.. Then why not just call it equality? Is it because then you have to acknowledge the inequality men face? Like how men have to pay for the livelihood of his ex wife so that she doesn't have to do anything and sleep with her new boyfriends all day. Or like how a man can't do shit when his partner decides to kill his unborn baby. How a girl can ruin a boys entire life just by falsely accusing cause he is guilty until proven innocent. Or how majority of women when they start earning it's her money to use on cosmetics but when a man earn he is the provider of the family.
Just admit it girls you want equal rights but not equal responsibility. That's why you hide your matriarchal ideas behind the curtain of feminism. 
Other wise just call it ""equality"" And acknowledge that men are also treated unequally in our society. 

And Mr. Druv Rathee ap bohot data pel ke ek side ka sirf pros and ek side ka sirf cons dikha ke sabka mind distorted nahi kar paoge."
Morality and gratitude are needed.

"FULL EXPLANATION ON PUBLIC OUTRAGE IN LAMKA MANIPUR-
*Assam Rifles Fire at civilians in Tuiboung, Lamka causing heavy casualties.
In a scene reminiscing the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre of 1919, the Deputy Commissioner Shri Dharun Kumar S., IAS, gave a shoot at sight order which led to 3 dead and 100 critically injured at Lamka tonight(15/02/24).The incident happend after Shivanand Surve Superintendent of Police of Churachandpur District suspended a Police Officer for clicking photos with Kuki-Zo Village Volunteers. The protesters alleged that while the Chief Minister N.Biren Singh and MP Sanajaoba have often clicked photos with Arambai Tenggols, and while Manipur Commandos have also openly fought side by side with terrorists Group UNLF and Arambais, there has been no case of Suspension. Infact The Manipur institution runs only for the interest of Meiteis. What angered the protesters more was that when the Kuki-Zo Civil Societies met the SP this evening, he arrogantly dismissed them and said that action would be taken against the Officer by any means. Thus, the irate mob burned down Police Vehicles parked outside the DC's Office. The problem in Manipur now is that AFSPA has been removed from the Valley while it is strictly enforced in the Hills. While the Assam Rifles were supposed to first give warning even under the AFSPA, they directly shot at the protestors causing heavy casualties. It has also been alleged that a Meitei Sepoy among the Assam Rifles was seen directly shooting at the crowd. Meanwhile, angered further by the heavy casualty, the mob set ablaze the DC's Office and Bungalow which they saw as a symbol of Meitei hegemony and atrocity. The situation demands a proper Judicial Enquiry and a lack of faith in the Justness of the Indian government Will not bode well for this sensitive border state. Jai Hind.ЁЯЗоЁЯЗ│"

"i m a Feminist BUT I DISAGREE with 50% of your video,
Let's really look at it in logical perspective Dhruv,
1) What ideas/beliefs are TRYING to link with the word ""Feminism"" through BOLLYWOD or other Social media influencers??? (which has an IMMENSE impact on middle class mindset)
2) What ""middle class "" think of feminism? (there is a huge gap between reality and public POV )
3) What impact will this beliefs have on middle class human life? Social Relation? and Intimate Relation?
4) with this belief, how much baised decisions will be in any fight or ego conflicts between people? (such as false rape case, false dowery case, fase home violance case big example is JOHNY DEPP and men cant even defend it in any way)

See, i am not against feminism but i am awaring you how bollywood or so called Social media influencers are trying to take BENIFIT of this ""Feminist Wave"" to THEIR advantage.

In this video whatever you said is absolutely correct I wonтАЩt deny but what about the other side of facts you left them 
An ideal thing to do cannot always be the right thing to do
Equality is a strange bitch that cannot be served without being subjective and the best in this world can happen is providing similar rights to women like education officials posts and right to their speech it there are certain jobs they cannot have as well and vice veeza it goes for men as well"

"I agree with this ideology but the main point of toxic feminism is not talked in here toxic feminism is where female tries to supresss men by vindictive methods there are many eg of this but there is one that a female cheats on her husband but in her divorce by changing some pointers she is shown as a victim and the husband is forced to give half of his properties and also alimony on top even if the husband isn't at falthe is being punished another eg that I will take with the reference to the video is that if a woman's scotoor is crashed against a man's scooter socity will protect the women and harm the man is this what feminism is or is it toxic feminism.

"@dhruvrathee don't show just one side of the society. You had speak about this fake feminism too which is currently growing fast. This fake feminism is also harmful for our society where these girls too advantage of lack of knowledge about the feminism among the girls.
Our society has come to know about all these patriarchy (CHAPARI) guys who are toxic.  So people avoid opinion of such CH***YAS and ignore them.
So from next time please try to put both sides IN DETAILS of the subject which you speak. We expect from you to show us both side of the coin unlike pur media."

"Feminism is really important for the society for the equality. But some girls don't understand the term feminism properly which has created the new term fake feminism(Eg. If some guy is doing something for you with love then don't show the fake feminism instead appreciate his efforts). This fake feminism is destroying our society just like patriarchy. Girls/women should know the true meaning of feminism. I have elder sister so I can understand the true meaning of feminism, it's not like I am in oppose of feminism. 
Thank you"

"I strongly disagree with you Dhruv Rathee for the first time. It's not only our Tradition, Culture or Religion that teaches us Patriarchy but there are other reasons for it too. Patriarchy doesn't mean that Men should abuse women but you somehow defined it like that by those examples you gave in the video. Mass media also promotes Feminism that doesn't mean the idea of Women given by feminism is an Ideal Women standard. And no our differences are not only physical differences of some organs but there are differences in our minds too, you can find many scientific studies on the difference between a male and a female mind. It's like you never approached to understand the perspective of a Rational person having patriarchal ideology, You are just assuming things about them and answered all of it based on your opinions. You never asked why patriarchy is better for the family and the society than feminism and you didn't even do much research about it. You gave many examples of Feminist men and only two of them had stable family relationships. Western countries are following this feminist ideology and we know the divorce rate in those countries. A stable family builds a stable society and a stable society builds a stable country. I know I haven't explained many things like how feminism is related to divorce so I hope you research it for yourself or my comment will be too long. Patriarchy doesn't mean that Men can oppress women but there are certain differences based on which we are given certain roles. I can also say people like you in mass media promote patriarchy as an idea where a man oppresses a woman but it isn't the truth. I hope you all don't misunderstand my comment as a misogyny. But he said any rational and sensible man would be a feminist, I mean you are not so rational or sensible because you didn't research enough on what basis the ideology that other person is. It's okay to disagree but calling someone who doesn't have the same ideology as you ""irrational and insensible"" without even knowing much about them is actually irrational and insensible. Thank you so much"

Make a video on lgbt
I always have been a supporter of femanism beacuse that's how i have been raised in my family but the truth its nit just the chapri boys on social media who represent femanism in a wrong way but also the chapri girls who represent female in a very wrong way. I think both the genders needs to be taught what real femaism means. I bet most of the people be it male or female doesn't even know the real meaning of femanism.
I have say this this man is great. And he show us ki jo saba karta ha woi right nahi hota. Ami brain ka use kare and har chis ko deeply socha.and her ek chis ko khude jachi kara. Great man

"I am a feminist and I didn't ask abt my husband's income before getting married. Why? Because I never imagined myself not earning.

Another best example for feminism is world first woman prime minister is sirimawo bandaranayaka in sri lanaka
"I think most of the men's psychological issues are actually related to ""women"" judging them based on how masculine they are, and taking a preference to the most alpha masculine guys (which btw is a result of millions of years of evolution). So naturally men try to conform to that role to find better chance of success with women.
For example, women will replace men at a high end exec job, and then also want to marry someone who is more successful than them also, while men have no such requirements.
Men on the other hand will always prefer better looks in their partner and are often willing to compromise on almost everything else, which is equally ridiculous."

19:47 finallly someone said it logically
"Reason for hate is not women its the unnecessary advantages given based on reservation and diversity in name of feminism i am not saying these should not be given but should be given based on needs, cause a girl whose father is earning in crores is also given the same privileges as the girl whose father is barely feeding the family according to me the concept of solving these issue using reservation and diversity hiring is completely uterless and is not improving the conditions at all"
I loved to watch dhurv dada videos but this one is kinda out of topic like it's portraits only men is worng.
goosebump's
"Well made video! But the real challenge today is misogynists using feminism's brand name to push antiwomen legal policies in which any man can identify as a woman by taking up regressive  stereotypes attached to women.  

And co opt their reservations, sports category, prison spaces, washrooms etc. 

This isnt a joke. Its a serious issue that many refuse to even acknowledge. Or simply cancel other saying transphobic. As of womens safety and fair right arent imp anymore."
it's a common sense to support feminism.

Ya fir sirf mai akela hu jo India se hu kyoki..humme se bahut log hai jo aapki video dekhte hai aur unko English ni aati hai...
Feminism nature ke qilaf hai. Mard aur aurat alag alag hai. Kan ank ki baat kar rahe ho. Janwar me bi hai  kya Janwar bhi Insan hai
"I like dhruv's content but this is a very misleading video..

The current scenario of Feminists is more inclined towards matriarchy... Undeniably...

As much as I'm a feminist in the true sense, I would never support the feminist moment in its current form.

Women and men are not equal, that's a hard fact.. take it or be delusional. Giving an argument that two men are also not equal for some trait change is very foolish. In that way every animal is similar to humans...

However women and men should have equal rights."

"Ya know, u can beat around the bushes about the CHHAPREES, but u're doing EXACTLY what the CHHAPREES do. Leaving the REAL points of ILLOGICAL LAWS in Sex CRIME n DIVORCE, made by FEMINISTS in last 60 yrs specifically.

And pointing at anything that sounds LOGICALLY right to you.
I CHALLENGE  you or ANY FEMINIST out there to Get into a LOGICAL discussion about Feminism with either me or even ELON MUSK, and we'll rub the floor with your Brains SMASHED.

TALK about how Burden of PROOF was transferred to Alleged CRIMINAL in SEX CRIMES.
Talk about how WOMEN have RESERVED seat for having a VA-GINA, but not FOR MEN having a D-ICK.
TALK about how FEMINAZI countries like INDIA have all SEX CRIME and DIVORCE laws against MEN,
And they were ALL enforced by Feminists (Male n Female) in just last 100 yrs, not by PATRIARCHY.
And U'll see, your FEMINIST LOGIC runs into a DRAIN.

And for any ignorant people, who don't know, Feminist propaganda is on for about 160 yrs in the WEST. They're effecting the laws all over the world and for at least last 60 yrs in INDIA alone. YOUR CONSTITUTIOn and 100% of POLITICIANS are licking Feminists BOOTS all year long."

Lagta hai tujhe kisi ne  mara hai isiliye iss topic pe video banaya
One of the worst video of Dhruv Rathee.
I think TMBNIL was changed
"It is true that feminism started with the purpose of equal rights, but recent incidents are proves that feminism has taken a wrong direction now and it should be scrapped and some other movement like equalinism (or something) should be started. Cases where women harass men with the same rights provided through feminism are increasing and men don't have any rights to defend themselves, more wives are cheating upon their husbands. There are scams going on in the market with the help of women. 
Additionally, the job market is suffering because of international reasons, the pressure of income is upon the males in the society (even most of the women pressuries males), with the growing population the competition increases, at the same time various jobs have got cast based reservations, on top of these now even women have started competiting, so it has become very hard for the males to atleast land a job. (My personal experience in my college on-campus placements is that companies prefer an unskilled woman upon a skilled man). 
Moreover indian constitution has always tried to not discriminate among any of the groups, so there is no need of any movement to get rights (rights are there already). It's the social stigma that needs to be addressed and that can be done through awareness campaigns.
Personally I don't support any movement, I think nothing is permanant and hence nothing should be made into a necessity. Infact the people who have qualities should be given the chances, and it should not be taken as a pride that there are more male workers / female workers / trans workers. I wonder when will people start treating work as work and not associate it with status, gender, caste, etc."

"I agree with you, there is a minor confusion, you said men and women are not different, they are similar and should be equal, u took examples of men having a high IQ and a low IQ,they have equal rights. But don't we have caste based reservation for this exact thing? Bcz those men/women belonging to lower caste gets more benefits than the upper caste, is it equal then? And if you study in detail, the people taking advantage of reservation,most of them don't need it, and who deserve it don't get it. How that's equal rights?"

1. Women wanting a man who earns more and is taller than her is due to evolutionary reason as opposed to societal conditioning. This preference can be seen all over the world regardless of what society women are living in.
2. Feminism may not have shown support for women assaulting men but they also didn't criticize either. Their silence led to chapri gang making all kind of assumptions.

"The problem is that a lot of women believe in this pseudo feminism where women are raised up higher than men and given more opportunities compared to men. Equality doesn't mean preferential treatment. Equality doesn't mean diversity hiring in corporates to advertise their oh so inclusive work culture. Equality doesn't mean that a complaint by a woman against a man is taken seriously but a complaint by a man against a woman is laughed at. Equality very literally means the very opposite of providing better benefits and opportunities to one segment, which is what is happening with the current understanding of pseudo feminism. 
Yes, it's true. No feminist condoned these acts that you showed in the video. But did any feminist condemn these acts? Do the real women feminists looking for equality stand up and say no this is a benefit that you're providing to women that we don't want coz this goes against the spirit of feminism?"

"men and women are not same because nature designed it for a specific reason. Man killing more themselves than women because of feminine toxicity. Women should be given right to pursue there career freely and paid on the basis of skill but in reality modern society will collapse as female will get more interaction with opposite sex and will eventually leave there partner for high value man. Best example kareena kapoor she left Shahid to secure her future by marriage rich saif . She is a idol for many women so women deeply believe this then whether you pay them equally or not they will develop there own reason to abonded there family for money and power. It's inbuilt no education can change this. Our Society is already started collapsing by increasing no of failed marriages, father less or motherless kids.

"4:54 Shame on you Dhruv!! You mocked the Garud Puran because it enlisted features of an ideal wife for the sake of your feminism, Then why don't you say - 
why female companion names appear before males when we take names of our almighty couples for example; Radha Madhav, Gauri Shankar, Siya Ram 
Also popular characters are known by their mother's name and not by father's for example; Hanuman - Anjaneya, Ram - Kaushaleya, Arjun - Kaunteya, Karn - Radheya
Please stop spitting incomplete facts at least about my Sanatan Dharm. Either say it completely or don't say."

"Bro, women have equal rights, and every man supports them, it's not about their rights, it's about how they act as a man in their sexual life. Feminists are not fighting for social rights, they are fighting so that girls can go out and party like men, wear short dresses and sleep with any guy they want like a man can do. Which is impossible because no matter how equal they are in social life, there's a basic difference in our body and hormones. And ik u still can't understand. It's not about kalpana chawla. It's about the girls who act in series like 4 more shots. Those girls are not kalpana chawla bro and they never can be."

"The points you make are about 1st and 2nd generation feminism, but the 3rd and 4th generation feminism captures opposing views to the 1st and 2nd - especially with the addition of trans, which pollute the definition in its original form.

While your video addresses the 1st and 2nd generation points, it fails to express its distinction on the 3rd and 4th generation meaning of the term. Which can in turn could mislead. I would presume that this topic isn't covered in its entirety or was made in a hurry with clickbait terms. 

The definition of terms in language evolve over time and unfortunately language cannot sufficiently capture the evolving nature of them."

"Thank you for making this video, I have watched many of your videos and I just feel good as there is someone with real power to influence huge number of people, about topics which I also keep on stressing in my immediate society, however possible. 
On another point, I have a doubt, will this society can ever be feminist as the hierarchy is always based on the paternal side? Titles are always adapted by the females and not the other way?
But if we look at science or the nature, it takes both the males & females to create life.
Can this patriarchal society can ever evolve and be logical enough to see that nature always shows us the equality and necessity of both the genders and the harmony between males & females for creating and living a life, and stop suppressing each other? And also, I feel Indians have a longer way to evovle than the other developed countries, which are already on the path of understanding this fact."
"Obviously he is turning into western ideologies after he got married to a foreigner woman. This guy has no religion he believes in Darwin's fake story.

"Some people are still confusing between Patriarchy (more right & power to men) and Matriarchy (more right & power to women). You have to understand that, feminism is not just about females because it has 'fem' in it. It is a common ground between Patriarchy (toxic masculine) and Matriarchy (toxic feminine) simple. Feminism is a balance between Patriarchy and Matriarchy. Those who use ' toxic feminism/feminist ' while talking about some negative thing done by a woman, let me tell you there isn't anything like it. You can call them stupid, wrong, immature, etc. and same goes for men. The way we call some negative movie done by women as toxic, why don't reject many negative movies done by men as toxic. If one gender can be wrong why not the other gender and considered as cool attractive. Isn't that hypocrisy ? When feminism talks about that hypocrisy it becomes negative for some people and they call ' toxic feminism '. And some girls are not staying low in the race, call them selves as feminist and do all possible stupidity using the tag.  So in my opinion we have to choose common ground.. feminism. Some comment here saying why feminism, why not other name for the movement ? I ask you even if there is a name change will the cause change ?!! тШ║"

"Justice is better than equality, having equal opportunity is not justified when someone needs more support than others. Demanding equality will resolve general discrimination but not resolve such cases where special care is required depending upon the scenerio:
1) Remember the slogan when ship sinks: Ladies and childeren first
2) Giving your seat to elder person because that person needs it more
3) Allowing ladies to skip the queue
that is the major reason not to support feminism.

Wasn't the video about toxic femanism then when did u shift to other topic i.e patricarcy ik it's somehow related to femanism and it but why did u change the topic wasn't the topic should about how women are misusing their rights in the name of femanism how the meaning of femanism has changed as the time passed and how advantage of such rights are taken by so called educated women against man and discrimination them and creating a situation of helplessness and vain for the men. You said that no real femanism support acts like Neha dhupia and the Lucknow taxi incident but neither they criticise it and indirectly let it happen and if they actually care about equality then they should also support men for their rights why fight for only equal rights of women as if that's the only gender in existence. Why did u shift the topic to patricarcy and making people believe than man is the absolute casue of everything behind every pain every discrimination every problem even problems related to their own loneliness is themselves why are creating a situation of self doubts for men. The topic u should be addressing is about toxic femanism not what is real femanism and where it derived from unlike the video of animal where u openly expressed toxic masculinity it's like u blaming everything on men and urself creating an irony idk what's your agenda or objectives are but the way u expressed the video it feels than u are the one who promote matriarchy.
Very well explained!!! Only Dhruv can do this!!
"Physical, hormonal, phycological differences between men and women are big enough that different laws are made for each. Case study is your egalitarian scandinavian countries that provide all equal opportunities, but they do not observe equal outcome. Feminism is not natural and by equality you weaken family as synergy in complementary roles is destroyed. Only divine guidance is objective, balanced, and gives just rights to both genders. Modern and subjective тАШismsтАЩ like these is a clear recipe for more crime, depression and civilization collapse like the West."

"No rape law for man ?
No extramarital affair law for man?
Why should man would pay for womanтАЩs livelihood after divorce?
And much more which is missing in menтАЩs right but no real тАЬfeministтАЭ talks about it. Just blames mens for all thing."
"Wonderful content, as always and very clear yet humane take on such a complex issue. Actually it should be very common sensical, but years of social conditioning have put layers of stigma - so much so, to understand the real issue requires unpeeling of few layers.

One thing to add: while we all cry foul about тАЬrightsтАЭ, the тАЬresponsibilityтАЭ aspect is often overlooked - and along with Bollywood-inspired toxic feminism, this is another reason for misinterpretation of feminism. For instance - many women do jobs and earn money, but very few (at least in India) put themselves as primary (or equal) responsible person for familyтАЩs financial security. Thats still the тАШmans jobтАЩ.

As long as one interprets feminism as means to be equal/ equivalent in both responsibility and rights - and not as some fancy buzzword to exploit men, or squeeze out the best of both worlds - you understand it was never about just men or women, itтАЩs purely тАЬhumaneтАЭ, and honestly, thereтАЩs no other way.

At the end, nature didnтАЩt create us to compete against each other - but to complement."
You are right in this video but there is another side to this argument where women take unfair advantage of feminism to target men and exploit them in the name of feminism. You should have talked about that too.

Feminism is not even able to define what is female
There is first wave which doesn't agree with second wave of feminism abd second with third and so on
If we Highlight the Toxicity of Feminism then people like Dhruv rather says it's not feminism
But on the other hand when the come to criticize Masculinity then the connect every negative thing like beating wife,drinking,smoking,etc to Men,bro why u doesn't say that this is also not masculinity"

Most of the time we see fake feminism or feminazism instead of feminism. There are lots of false cases of rape or molestation because these fake feminists take advantage of their power and abuse it. Patriarchal people too exploit the women taking advantage of their power. Both are harmful.
"Feminism is about equallity, you are right about that, women should be treated equally i agree with it completely. But...
 the other things you talk abt. 
Like wage gap, it depends on the hours you put in, in the corporate world, in entertainment biz it depends on the amount of crowd you pull in, same with sports, thats how biz works if women do the same amount of work put in the same amount of shifts and yet are less paid n it has been goin on for long dont you think companies wd hv hired more females than males so they cud exploit them financially?
I mean big companies set up their manufacting units in 3rd world countries for a reason, ie cheap labor bein a major one, in biz it is always high profit less investment, you should understand that you are in a biz urself, i am sure you pay ur crew on their working time n amount of hours put in rather than basing the pay on genders. Like wrestler rhonda rousey says i am paid  more because i bring in more crowd, if someone else does that they will also be paid more, fashion industry is dominated by women, women hv higher pay than men, because thats good business that is how business is, a man cannot say there why am i paid less, because he dont bring in same amount business in fashion industry as women do. 
Then you talk like motherhood aint part of empowerment or feminism, shouldnt it be their choice to work, be a housewife, be a mother or do a combination of two in the first
place. Men n women are different if they werent why would there be a need of gender classification in the first place, i can understand where u r goin at with eg of we hv same organs n all but there certain things a man cant do, certain things a female cant do, like breastfeed for eg that is how nature intended it to be.
Another one is alpha male, yes some ЁЯдб s who call themselves alpha males who in real are jobless wimps lacking responsibility drop unnecessary hate towards women, the same way dont u think misguided privileged well educated spoiled by parents modern feminsts who seek n attract attention for their insecurities over some jobless idiots views over petty issues like short dresses or other dumb stuff, changing the attention from a great movement shud be treated as a hindrance as well and at the same level of the misguided toxic males, cause all these people do is blame one gender. when feminism fights against injustice like physical abuse n other unfair ways and for equallity. There is broader perspective to lot of things.
Western misguided ideals hv heavely backfiredfor them, these misguided notions hv left them split, bitter and divorced leaving their children with troubled, financially unstable familes, parents who become drug addicts, irresponsible, which leads them to be put in foster homes where they abused or mistreated most of the time, leading them into the path of crime and the cycle of events keep coming back for more. Its high time we woke up from misguided misunderstood ideals from the west, ( no hate against west, they themselves agree to this, as statistically proven in crime rate survey mentioned in the book freakonomics)
In the end an equal contribution lays path towards a better 2moro, for everyone involved but there are certain things that differentiate us men n women and that shouldnt be a problem if we understand & aknowledge them be there when one needs other.
This is nothing against you, a big fan always watch ur vids, will do so in future too. But just that on such sensitive topics shud hv put broader light like u normally do. Appreaciate your work."

let me give you a exmpale.
if a beautiful girl tells a man to help her mans will agree and that girls always uses the man and mans think that the girls is obbsed with me. then the girl is wrong cuz she is using a  man who help her.
other side, if a trusted but ugly girl tells to a man to help her then the man will not agree there is a little chance that the man will agree and if he agree that ugly girl will happy and always thankful to the man. then that girl is right cuz she are always thankful for  that man who help help her.
we are not same yet, but we will same soon. everyone should get same rights.

Super video  bro
Keerthi history already made a great explanation of this topic before. Kudos to her for bringing this
"*Let's talk about equality -*
If a husband cheat on his wife, then file wife can an FIR against husband and put him into jail.... *BUT*

If a wife cheat on his wife then court will give two options -
1. Get divorce and give maintenance to wife every month of 30-40% of your income or either 
2. Don't get divorce and live with a wife that do adultery in front of you and you can't do anything.

Where is the equality?

Doesn't matter what definition given in dictionary, in reality *feminism means women superiority*"

"The real question was, you were ready to criticise Animal scene by scene in your video(of course, it was a trash film), but for the movies that are misleading the feminist  movements you just swiftly showed the posts made by critics? Where's your video on those films pointing what's wrong scene by scene? Or you accept that your video on Animal was just to farm views?

"Bro What about the hormones.... What about the attraction nature put in every single man for females being attractive and beautiful... Men need to learn how to respect women on the other hand there must be something that explains women their limits(like not using the benefit of natural attraction for wrong purposes or for fun)....  There is a natural way of living together in society which is accepting your roles and offering them with honesty. Extremism in both cases is worst thing and balance is important. Women is physically different from men which means they are meant for different things. If anyone wants the peace and stability of environment then instead of ""equalization"" there must be ""assignations"" of rules and regulations. The government should provide with facilities in which women work mostly with females and do tasks which they can do better than man.... There should be some kind of education which teaches every gender their role and their limits.... Feminism even proper one will just disturb the society in negative way... Rights which you are talking about will just allow some middle class teen age boys and girls to take wrong benefits like enjoying this like independencey(which is actually running away from restrictions that are meant for their peace and discipline) which is also happening in European countries and will just increase chaos in society.... Actual problems will remain at their places.... You need some practical life in a giant family to understand all this ......"

"If feminism is only about having equal rights then we don't need it, because you cannot name a single legal right that a man has and a woman does not.

The sad truth is that the only people who really need feminism are the poor souls who don't even know that this word exists. We already have equal rights in this country, but they don't know that."

"The video is really not addressing the real upliftment or empowerment of the women, it's like any other feminist propaganda video.
1) The normative bias or framework doesn't exist for men? people don't talk about ideal men? - these qualities are ""preferable"", that doesn't make anyone not having such quality as lesser human, it's just not preferred. 
2) Why it can not be a proud choice of a woman to be a homemaker? How's a woman not subscribing to being a homemaker is any better?
3) The whole video is an exaggeration of how Boys are being treated in the society - we are not at all treated in the way video is describing. The patriarchal survived because it has the potential to lead the society - matriarchal did exist, in a lot of anthropological societies - it simply couldn't survive. The current status of patriarchy borrows a lot more credibility  from history, evolution, civilisation, wars etc. Leave it naturally, the system which is capable of leading the society would automatically survive - why there's a moral schooling around it.
4) Of course the examples which are given are basis the statements who pretend to be flag barer of Feminism, is it not the responsibility of feminist camp, to disassociate with Neha Dhupia - and give a clarification? 
5) Sudha Murthy - A character who shall be worshiped for empowering and a true feminist - she is the one who discards the toxic feminism. 
6) Bashing patriarchy doesn't really helps in selling feminism. The whole point, that Patriarchy and Feminism are standing against each other is itself flawed - they are the ideas which complements each other."

"If Animal is against women then what about The Game Of Thrones ? Gangs of Wasseypur?

"I have been watching your videos Dhruv  since way back and you have been mostly successful in communicating the topics presented in them, but this video did not do its thing atleast for me, the topic you presented here with such easiness and straight-forwardness is dangerous... the topic itself is more complicated. I lean more with the views presented by Dr. Jordan Peterson in most of his talks because he's able to communicate the message of equality between both the genders while acknowledging proper differences based on years of research, trends and human behavior and human anatomy. Today it felt like this video of yours was completely opinionated while trying to please a section of society or maybe this video needed more.... This is my first ever comment on your channel because I felt like I should share this thought."

"The problem with feminism is that it advocates for equality ONLY if and when it benefits women. It attaches 0 accountability for women.
Feminism ends when the bill arrives.
Men still are required to adhere to their traditional roles and have good jobs, house, assets, etc ; while women can have all benefits of being women without having to adhere to any traditional gender roles"
If both woman ( wife) and man (husband) both are doing work and earning then the husband shall do house chores but if man is earning and women is not she has no right to ask her husband to do household work or appoint a maid and vice versa.
Real truth is feminism is cancer.

Equality can never exist . Because ultimately it's a question of power and power can't be donated it has to be earned irrespective of gender. If someone works hard to achieve a position and others finds it provocative  then they need to grow up. Equal rights chillane se equality nahi aata.

"While talking about feminism it's disappointing why he didn't talk about lgbtqia+ too, it could have provided a more clearer lens to know what feminism talks about and upholds. Another thing which is as ridiculous as macho men's criticism of feminism, is Dhruv Rathee himself using the popular slur 'chhapri' to address toxic, masculine men, you guys should have studied more about India's caste genealogy and know where these slurs come from. Chhapris are a lower caste community who existed for longer in Indian society than internet opposition of feminism came."

"The prime difference between a men and a women is their physic other than this everything is approx  similar or same!
It is natural difference and every women understand this no need to throw up your thoughts!"
Well I don't agree with Dhruv on this issue. Lots of fallacies in arguments. I wonder what rights men have today that women don't. On the contrary women have lots of privileges today( rightfully so to uplift women ). People are good and bad irrespective of gender.

"There are certain questions in my mind...
Please help me with them
1-   Is there any kind of job category in which women are not allowed  in today's world ?(as we are talking about equal job opportunity) 
2- In India, Is there any kind of elections in which women are not allowed to vote or they don't have right to vote ?(if we are talking about equal right to vote)
3- If we are talking about equal wages provided for a particular job..( example :  if women are  working for a job like 12 hours and men are working for the same job like 14 hours and producing more output then  ....I think whoever produces more better and good output for a company should receive more wages irrespective of their gender)

If I am wrong please correct me...your thoughts on this are highly respected and appreciated."

"My personal understanding is the environment you live in. As a woman I was never forced to have a career nor put in that conditioning that I had to be house bound. It was a matter of choice. 
However I do feel we need to have skills. Education isn't just about having a job. 
You may need to know how to drive and run your house which involves accounting. File your own return blah blah. 
I know friends who don't work and it's a common understanding with their husbands and I know friends who do work. I don't believe in feminism. Am not an extremist of any sort."
"Salman rushidie is not a legendary writer . He is a bigot and an  islamaphobe . His book satanic verses is a clear example of hate speech and his intolerance against muslims. 
Using his quotations as basis of an argument, seems to me _ unfair."
"My simple question is if patriarchal ideology is destroying the life of men and women in our society, how you can say that feminism will not affect the same to the men and women also in the same way and it will not result in what you have mentioned about negative effects of patriarchal ideology?? But i think promoting feminism will effect more adversely  on our society along with the patriarchal ideology. I am neither supporting Patriarchal  nor feminism ideology. But i think its nonsense discussing all these things and illogical blind promotion of any such like ideologies. Nature has given some characteristics and responsibility to both of the masculine creatures, we should fulfill it."
"Perfect! Everything is perfectly organised and will clear so many doubts of people. I also have learned so many things from this video, I used to take the feminist word as an insult or a taunt as most of the people of my group believe in patriarchy. But now I can proudly say that I'm a feminist. I'm a brother, a son and a boyfriend and I'm really lucky that my close ones believe in positive sides about feminism and appreciate every work of the feminists ЁЯШЗ"

I truly agree with him ...serials and films of today are so patriarchal that I feel that cartoons are better. Too much of patriarchy is ingrained in our society and we consume it all subconsciously..and thus we are impacted adversely!!
"Why are only hindu puran, hindu women used as examples? Why not use Muslim, Christian texts, cases as examples where women are treated much worse than hindu women? These are small things that effect the viewer, a hindu boy or girl might watch this and think Hinduism is against women equality. People Dhruv always have some agenda against certain groups hidden in something positive."
"Give equal right to woman
Society will be destroyed."
I face feminism daily. E.g. If i am sitting in a sharing rickshaw and if a woman has to sit beside me then she will come from the other  side and sit besides another man sitting next to me or sit next to another woman. Provided there is another woman sitting next to me. If this is not feminism then what it is. Insult on a daily basis.
Very informative as usual. Actually so many people don't know the concept. Thank you
"In the last 2 examples about the Lucknow incident and Neha Dhupia, did any of the feminist come to aid the guy. Did any of the feminist criticize Neha for her hypocrisy.

"Nice video. There should be equal rights for men and women. However, this imbalance comes from the system, law of the land also. As far as equal rights are concerned, the law treats men and women differently and it fuels the alpha men thought when there is discrimination done with men. E.g. Almost always Men are guilty until proven innocent whereas women are innocent until proven guilty."

Problem was never about giving equality it was about mentality first we struggle to change men's mentality about women now because of that women in west and some places here they feel they are superior problem is about Mentality

Stamina (larger heart and lungs = more
Oxygen intake)
Women:
Combat (can exploit the weak-point of a

Weapons (often carrying purses, wearing
heels and possibly heavy jewelry, even
hairpins to stab with)
Endurance <= (smaller muscles require less

Equalities:

"I call myself a feminist but making a whole video on it and not addressing the common issues faced by feminist men of today is hypocritical(eg man has to pay on the first date, DIVORCE laws, child custody, false alligations etc etc). You gave examples of the simplest issues out there - ones that no one can debate or talk about. You took the easiest way out.
And saying 'not a real feminist' has become today's 'not a real man'. who is distributing the certificate? where is the line being drawn?  Actions are happening under that banner. So ignoring and saying that 'they' do not belong to this pure, ideal group doesn't cut it.
I concede that you highlighted what feminism should be but A big channel like you should have called out more double standards and addressed the issues faced by non-'chapri' men as well."

"I think many people have wrong concept about 'feminism' because of the term itself. Since the term is derived or is similar to 'female', people think that it's about 'female superiority '. 
In my opinion it would have been better if a better teram was used to describe it. Maybe 'NORMALISM' or 'EQUALISM' will be better as the term itself indicates equality.
Idk if my opinion is a better solution or not, it's just what I feel so."

Same with obc and other quotas given to groups. If the quota system goes away, then i feel you can say everyone is equal. Please do respond. If possible please do make a video about the quota system and how it affects other people who may be intellectually better. Thank you."

"All is about ""log kya kahenge"" , dont know why log sirf dushre kya kahenge uss pe hi depend karte h, all are humans , sab ke pas emotions h , sabko wahi krna chahiye jo unka man kare . Dushro ke baato pe bilkul dhyan nhi dena chahiye. Insaan akela aya h ,akele hi jayega ,aur jitna din jiyega kya sirf dushre kya kahenge uss pe ? , kehne do koi kya hi kehta h . Insaan bano , aur apni life khud ke marji se jio. Life is short , dont waste your time by listening all these stuff"
Very bad content. Seems not matured
"Feminism's name has been tainted by the west, especially the privileged people that have everything in life but they want to be the victim, they overused terms like girl power and patriarchy for justifying their spoiled behaviour, whereas till this day in Middle East and in India there are still a lot of women and girls who wanted to be something but cannot raise their voice due to the environment set around them and unfortunately the privileged feminists of big cities are not going to be a big help for any of them."

Basically feminism is not wrong but feminist are wrong who promote sexuality and LGBT like things in our community that's why a lot of people are against feminist.......like they demand that women will also go outside without a top like men and their are a lot of demands which are against our culture and religion and you people will observe these days the immodesty in Bollywood and feminist are promoting these things.....

Totally disagree with your video today.women never can be equal to men .they have different roles. Women have been getting privilege all the time.they are also  getting almost all the rights in democratic countries.
A very enlightening video on what feminism really is. This must be watched by everyone who thinks that feminism means oppressing or objectifying or going against men.

"Feminism has come a long way since its inception, challenging societal norms and advocating for gender equality and justice. While it has its advantages and disadvantages, feminism has undeniably made significant progress towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society. By recognizing the contributions and struggles of women, we can continue working towards a world where gender does not limit one's opportunities or dictate their worth."
"You talked about Patriarchy in blacks ,whites, indians, christians.

"First of all the Indian law doesn't seem to believe in women empowerment, or think they can be independent, all they do is choose to view them in innocent, victim perspectives. Many recent cases are evident where the wife is getting paid alimony despite the fact that she is committed to an extra marital affair, in some cases the wife is draining the husband physically and mentally. Though she is literate, earning good for herself, she demands alimony. When they are physically fit and audacious enough to file a false case without any fear that they may get punished, why can't they continue to do the job earn bread & butter for themselves and split the children's financial responsibility, if they believe in feminism. Why no feminist is opposing it, it's clear the women with such cases are demoralising the spirit of feminism. In my opinion considering the recent cases, I feel that some of the Indian judges deliberately choose to be ignorant.

I believe there should be gender neutral laws, no matter which gender committed the crime should be punished.

Dear @dhruv rathee I request you to make an informative video on such cases and how some Indian judges are demoralising feminism."

Pata nahi kiski beti ko khush karna chahta hai yeh banda.( Dhrub rathee= shubham mallik) The number of fake cases registered for harassment and domestic violence by women are somewhere close to 98% as Shonee kapoor suggested and in all likelihood this represents the actual number for the proportion of false cases as I explain it here:
Well first of all we need to understand that all Women related laws and especially dowry related laws are non-bailable and cognisable. That means cases can be registered against husbands without any kind of evidence being provided by the accuser-women and the husband is also arrested immediately and put in jail until he gets a bail.
When feminists do not use logic while registering the cases and in all publications they only cite the number of cases registered, knowing fully well that cases are registered even where there is not an iota of evidence then it is quite surprising to see how they seek to apply logic only when it is convenient to them for proving the statistics are wrong.
When a law is non-bailable which means police are allowed to do investigation and cases are registered entirely based on a written statement by the accuser and without any evidence. And if even after all these provisions, if the prosecution is not able to prove their case then why should it not be then deemed that the case itself was a false one to begin with.ЁЯШо"

"The only point I disagree here with Dhruv
Is supporting the right and condemning the wrong is a complete process.
The so called feminist should condemned the incident where a woman slapped a driver. And not the other way round to say ohh they didnтАЩt say anything so they didnтАЩt support guess what common sense says one should not beat anyone yet there would be people thinking it is justifiable in the name of feminism. To such people it is important for the influencers(feminist) to openly condemn so that stupids can somehow know from others what is right or wrong as their own common sense is a failure"

Perfect explanation. Explained everything so well but thereтАЩs one point I want to add onтАжitтАЩs not only males who donтАЩt know the exact meaning of feminism but also the females. Everybody need to educate themselves about feminism so that boys canтАЩt blame of any girl who doesnтАЩt know the exact meaning of feminism and so it doesnтАЩt become an issue or an opportunity to let them down.
"I have some confusions about feminism for example in our metro, trains, buses there are reserved seats for females but females are allowed to sit on seats which are not reserved for them where as if a male asks a female to vacate the seat for him although the reserved seats are available the females get aggressive and violent when this matter goes to police station or to the court due to a violent scene happened the police or the court taken female side saying that as a equal rights she can sit on any suitable place but a male cannot violet or can't be violent to occupy a seat which is reserved for females
Secondly please read about filing a case for domestic violence in which only females can file the case and males cannot
These are just an examples for your research
I am not against equality for any gender but when our judiciary teaches us like these examples and there are no signs of alternatives can we really appreciate or follow for the thoughts of feminism ?
As a human we learn everything by our surroundings and if we see discrimination since our childhood against any gender by any person, society, government or judiciary system we cannot be feminist

"I appreciate @dhruv to bring more clarity into feminism.
If feminism mean equal opportunity to both men & women then
1. why women are given priority over men by granting them reservation in private & govt. Sector??
2. Why women are given financial benefits like land reg. Concession, tax concession, scholarships etc.

I think from my perspective most of the men wants equal rights for women but not at their expense. Even after that no one even acknowledges the men's contribution. That's why men usually get annoyed talking about feminism.

Also,

1. Men too are victim of patriarchal mindset but they usually dont react every small thing but they fight & overcome the issue.
2. Why the hell women need to attack on men everytime, they are ones who are now able to work at equal just because of efforts of men as well. But what men are the villians in the end. 

I just wanted to share what a man might feel. They want women to be equal but even they are victim themselves, helping women but all they recieve is abuse."

"Question asked : 
Is feminism destroying indian society? 
(Note: i am not a anti feminist. I support the feminist movement but not the modern unhinged version of it) 
Toxic femininity mentioned... (Forgets about it just after mentioning it) 
Talks every point positive of feminism. (Forgets about all the negatives) 
Blames patriarchy. 
Mentions male loneliness... Blames patriarchy. 

Says non feminist females have 'norm conformity' 
(Isnt being feminist a norm in today's generation..then are you also a norm conformist) 
Blames patriarchy again.

Mentions some events which people labled 'toxic female' (neha dupia and women hitting cab driver) diverts and starts bashing chapri alpha males of social media. (Dude come on! I dont think there exists a better way to show your bias) 


My personal points: 
If you watch a lot of youtube shorts you may have come across a youtube creator who is a lawyer. He makes shorts on the gender bais towards women in the indian law. 

There's gender inequality but not on the women's side its on the men's side. 
If you so called feminists do believe feminism to be a word for 'gender equality' and not 'female superiority' then why dont we ever see feminists fight to make the law equal for both the genders. 

When men try to fight for their rights they're 'Toxic males' but when privileged women fight for rights they already have and even so want more. Its suddenly 'female impowerment. ' 
There's still great amount of women suffering in the rural areas. But their problem has already been given a solution. Its just that they either dont know of it or it hasn't reached them yet."

I've been seeing so many videos regarding 'Toxic feminism' where they've been talking about bollywood movies promoting 'Toxic feminism' where they don't even get into the real meaning of feminism and are only talking about the negative sides but this video was totally different where Dhruv explained the meaning of feminism and related it to tons of shits going around irl not only stupid movies .

Neena gupta was talking about idiotic feminism
"I often have generalized men as selfish and violent, because growing up, I hadn't seen any good epitome of a man, I had only seen them disrespect women. I faced sexual abuse as a kid by some guy, by a cousin too, I saw my father disregard my mother, even most of the guys in my class were just downright disgusting and immature. I can't help but feel like all men are same, even tho a rational part of knows we can't generalize a whole gender but Dhruv, men like you have regained my trust, and given me hope that there's good people out there."
11:21 I imagined you
"females vouching for feminism will be the first one to leave a man if he is crying or demean him if he is earning less (just like men demean women in their houses bcz they earn more or only they are earning). You can change the Society but not these damn double standard Humans. Try to find one girl who chooses a Feminist Man in her life at first. Nope they wont. 1st they will get emotionally & Physically abused by a Toxic Man/Some Toxic Men & Later they will choose a feminist for their comfort, they wont show the necessary respect their partner, the same respect they want being a feminist.

"i love my daughter, my wife and my mother, it doesn't mean Men are equal to Women, that's why we have 2 different words to identify ... regarding rights ... it can never be ""Equal"", yes certainly it MUST be Equitable. .. grow up Dhruv."
"Despite agreeing with all the points you mentioned in the video, I do have to point that the vagueness in the civil/criminal laws of the country skews towards women with a bias, mostly considering the man to be in the wrong when the proof is inconclusive. This has caused an increase in misuse of the laws by some which make some men invalidate the actual issues other women face. Plus there's no substantial consequence for a woman when there's a misuse of said laws. Hence, I feel it fuels this divide between men and women."

Not only the ""alpha males"" of the comment section, but also the so-called wannabe ""feminists"" who twist the meaning of real feminism. In my opinion, you should have dug deeper into this because people notice people like this more than real feminists and tend to follow their path."

Dumbest analysis
abse nhi dekh rha mai teri video
"I can't thankyou enough for this particular video Dhruv. I'm a first year political science student, who faced so much criticism the moment i said I'm a feminist among my new classmates which ofcourse wasn't surprising but pretty disappointing. But that didn't stop me from giving them reasons and indulging into arguments as to why it's not a 'CANCER' (that's what they claim it is) i thought i might change their perspective for good But the saddest moment in this was, when a girl mocked me infront of those people as to 'why do i need Feminism? Don't we have equal rights, given to us by the constitution?' And i saw them giving that smug smile to show how I am the only crazy one here. 

In that moment i really wanted to ask her, ""We abolished Untouchability under Article 17 no? Then why we still see it being practiced widely across the country?"" 

But alas! I felt defeated in that moment because it was coming from a girl of my same age.

P.S. I'm gonna share this video in my class group and i dont care if they think I'm batshit crazy. ( for you gave me the courage that I've lost in bw.)"

"What about ""Matriarchy"" then? Is it acceptable or not?"
"ItтАЩs not equality you need, itтАЩs equity what you really need. This is what makes feminism pointless. 

Equality just divide everything without considering the demand or worth of individuals. ThatтАЩs why you have to follow equity to make a fair distribution of anything. You'll see women happily married with husband without job for centuries to come, same was before. But how many example you can give where wife earns and husband donтАЩt work??? 
I agree women should get a chance to get anywhere they want but through fair competitions and tests."

"A MOVEMENT IS DEFINED BY IT'S PEOPLE, NOT BY ANY DICTIONARY DEFINITION. Aaj ki society me feminism is dominated by femi-nazis it has become an ideology to hate men, rather than supporting equality, Actually as a society hume gender-equality ko gender-equality ki tarah hi dekhna chahiye, feminism, masculism, patriarchy aur matriarchy jaise shabd confusion create krte hai. Aajkal majority of the feminists ki ideology ko dekhkar agar feminism ki nai definition nikaali jaye to vo hogi -- ""ideology to hate men"". Mordern feminism females ki insecurity ka hi ek bhot bada reason hai, it's a paranoid, agar aap TV aur social media pe dekho ge ki sab aage khilaaf hai, to OBVIOUSLY aap insecure ho jao ge aur apne support me kisi movement ko join karloge fir chahe us movement ka purpose doosre group ko hate krna bhi kyu na ho. I am also against discrimination, sexism, rape, domestic violence, etc. But better if we remove the toxicity from these things and simply focus on GENDER EQUALITY. --Ritwik Dadarwal"

"This video reminds me of Jasleen Kaur and Sarvjeet case. For those who don't know, a young girl Jasleen posted a pic of Sarvjeet on Facebook stating that he had made obscene comments on her while they were amidst a traffic. The post became viral and the girl was praised for bravery. Sarvjeet was arrested. He didn't admit to the allegations claiming to be innocent. He was bashed by the netizens. Then some witnesses came forward who admitted Sarvjeet wasn't at fault. The charges at Sarvjeet were dropped after 4 years. He lost his job and couldn't find any other job. All because of false accusations made by that girl. Don't know how he is doing, but this incident is an example how feminists are misusing the laws given to them."

"I will not support you 100%, Dhruve. Males and females are not the same 100%. God created them for different work. In some work women are perfect, their men are not perfect and vice versa. People, by the name of feminism, give all the men's work to the women, and what do you gain now in this generation? More than half the percentage of divorce. Nobody wants to compromise for each other because now everyone thinks they don't need anyone since they earn money. In the middle, their kids suffer and get spoiled. The husband is a protector of the woman, but whoever tortured their wife, there should be rules and legal ways to deal with that, and the same goes for others. You never can expect when you walk with your wife, and some men are harassing her. At that time, of course, she will say you are the man; you should protect me. But men never can expect that. Of course, there is a purpose to create them differently physically and mentally.

This is why old-time family lives together. Of course, there were issues and suffering, but at least they learned to live together in the end. Somebody has the right over you in some cases; it doesn't mean that women have fewer rights. When we were kids or teens, our parents had power over us; they loved us, punished us, and disciplined us. Does it mean they were wrong? Parents and kids should have the same right to live together? Now western countries have this kind of mentality and make this rule. If their parents shout at them and even a little bit punish them, then they call the police. In this way, the young generation gets spoiled, and families get broken.

You also said the similarity between men and women. I know both of us have ears, nose, hands, and so on. But animals have that as well; similarity. Does it mean we and animals can do the same work? The main difference between humans and animals is we are intellectual. We use more brains than animals. This makes everything different and works differently. Women and men don't have the same feelings, brains, and hearts. Yes, it looks the same physically, but the way it thinks and feels is different. And that makes us different to do different work, where women are better in some cases, and males are better in other cases. We have even different choices of colors and toys from childhood. This is natural. We are making it unnatural.

Saying this, you are actually breaking society. Just remove the oppression part. Nobody should oppress each other. There is some extraordinary passion of women as well, and they can be astronauts, doctors, etc. And they still can do that. They did that before and are doing it now as well. God sets a rule as he creates humans, and he knows better how we get along. Problems happen when we each have different opinions and try to make our own rules. Just accept nature as it shows us. Women look lovely maintaining kids, houses, and families, and respect them and protect them as your wives. In the same way, men are physically stronger than women; they are good in outside work. Let them work for you. It looks sound and balanced. Just don't oppress each other. That's it."
"This video is a perfect example of what we call ""Cheery Picking Fallacy"". I used to respect this guy a lot but he lost it after animal review. That review was a great example of  ""Hasty Generalization Fallacy"", calling people mental for enjoying a movie? now that's stupid, He does have informational content on his channel and I respect that, but this guy is becoming more stupid by each day."

"Enough of what ideal feminism is and how it will benefit both men and women, let's talk about what goes on in real world. Feminism and female empowerment are widely used, especially in India to justify wrongs done by women on men. ""Women have suffered for so long, men's turn now"" is a common feeling among so many Indian feminist, including men. To say that not a single feminist agreed with Neha Dhupia there is a big overstatement. There were many. There are also many who justify similar scenarios. Low paying and physically challenging jobs are never scrutinised for being male dominated, only cozy and comfy high paying office jobs have the gaze of so called feminists set on them. Ask the feminist if she'd prefer being deployed as a front line combatant at the LOC while her partner stays back at home praying for her well being. It just doesn't happen as it's not natural. Ask the feminist if he/she supports gender quotas in job market. Most would say yes and that goes directly against the feel good idea of equality. Saying women don't have a body as strong as men but have a mind that can compete with men's so they should only be expected to demand equality in office jobs is also not fair. Why should 50% men who could've potentially grabbed a high paying office job be rejected to pave way for women with similar intellectual calibre or sometimes even less just for the sake of ""numerical equality""? That's goddamn inequality. 
And btw it's not like I wish for women to start lifting guns at the LOC or start laying bricks from tomorrow. That'd be a nightmare."

"When you realize there weren't any matriarchal civilizations in history and the fact that men have built every civilization by their sweat and blood makes feminism and matriarchy irrelevant and ridiculous. Its just a way to promote misandry and gynocentrism which builds unfavourable environment for both the genders, making them loathe and fight each other while destroying families and ultimately leading to the downfall of society because women can now act according to their whims and desires. They don't have to obey any authority."

Society, cultural practices, education, religion, etc all influence how women and men are viewed and what тАЬplaceтАЭ they hold in a household. Growing up in 80s I used to challenge these differences like my brother was allowed to stay out late even though younger but I had curfew of 7-8pm, he didnтАЩt have to do house chores but I was forced to learn them, I had to learn to save money but he was allowed to spend on snacks with his friends, I wasnтАЩt allowed to enter the mandir area or enter kitchen during menstrual cycle and so many other examples. And the funny part was- all of my girl friends were following or had to follow same rules. 
I would be punished for questioning the authority and humiliated for asking to be treated equally but I would be reminded all the time that if didnтАЩt go with the flow then I would have hard time finding a boy for marriage (which I didnтАЩt and in fact I met a lot of jerks in the process and choose to wait for the right person). 
The point is social reform doesnтАЩt only need to happen at a constitutional level but also at a household level (this would be grassroots level) where feminism and patriarchy doesnтАЩt need to called out but rather thereтАЩs equality, respect for each gender, acceptance and home free of biases!"

But now you are telling us that somehow we are wrong Patriarchy is an Issue. Then i think there is something wrong with your New Untested Method.
And to add a very important but Factual info
It was Men who allowed women to enter all these spaces and their rights but after that they started yapping about how being Gay is ok then тАЬwomen dont need menтАЭ then Men are evil and after that they started talking about accepting Trans people instead of treating them Mentally.

I do understand that this films do not justify the real feminism but they do portray the picture of what is feminism is to our youths who arenтАЩt really educated on such topics and learn mostly on social media and by films. Such films are highly brain washing our youth to a great level making them think that this is the real feminism or how should a sigma male should behave.

"The problem is in the name itself . Make it equal rights instead of ""feminism"" .

 Feminism may have a particular defination but... No one is here to to explain feminism to some illetrate , uneducated , underdeveloped popular people present at top of the society ,media and cinema. A large population of females follow them and get a completely different idea about it.  And that is why we've got some movies, speeches and all which provokes both genders. 

There is no patriarchy today except in some very very rural areas . It is in the past now everyone gets to study and beacome something these days. Patriarchy ended and feminism still lives    and for what ?

Feminism today involves equal rights for everyone  except men. 

Females have far more legal rights than men , i think legally males are helpless."

I don't really care about the definition but the people who uses it to the extreme.
The fact that we're different doesn't mean one is superior to the other. Though I want women to have the same rights as men and get paid the same if they're giving the same contribution.

"Animal mei joh female characters hai, unhone toh yeh script padh kar acting ki,  toh unhe koi kyun nahi bolta, no body forced her to do this role,
Why did they accept such roles in the first place"
"You are absolutely right. In this video you have touched every point. I remember when that case happened where that woman was slapping that Driver all these toxic men were so quick at posting how this is feminism this is because of empowerment as if women should not be empowered because of their empowerment theyтАЩre going to go around and slapping men, and there was so much misogyny and hatred towards women and I was so boggled Thinking that do these men not have mothers and sisters? Do they not have any empathy for them and what happens they see their mothers and sisters being suppressed at home and as a boy child theyтАЩre given special treatment when they go out they are nobodies and they see all these women progressing And they think women should be like their mother and their sister who are treated badly who go through everything that they do to them or their fathers. ItтАЩs the ingrained misogyny and I responded to one of those comments and I was bombarded with the toxic men, trying to justify how this is happening because women are being empowered. So the problem of modern India is that women are being empowered and they should not be thatтАЩs their issue. It was so ridiculous that you could see these people are talking with only two brain cells and there is just no point responding to them but it gives a good example of patriarchy at play, and then they make arguments like men are falsely accused , law is tilted towards women and what not and I have seen men guilty of things and then to save themselves from punishment They say they are innocent and they didnтАЩt do anything and theyтАЩre being falsely accused a lot of guys do that. Fortunately I have had amazing examples of men in my life for most my father and I have immense empathy fir men in  General and anybody for that matter, their lives are difficult but there are toxic and psychotic men also out there who make everyoneтАЩs life difficult, and in todayтАЩs world, those men are having hard time getting Someone to marry them and now that is converting into incel community and they have even more rage against women because theyтАЩre not accepted as who they are by women which is aggressive, self-centred, selfish, narcissistic."

"I m not against women, ofcource without a woman ( mother ) no one can exist on this planet.

But I see many such examples, when a man earns and takes care of his family then it is a normal thing but if a woman earns then she leaves no stone unturned to show herself superior to the man. I know many such families where women misused their powers and destroyed a happy family. And what can we say about today's girls who play with the emotions of boys?? Be it love or responsibility, it is always the man who becomes crazy (Majnu), Laila often sees the opportunity and makes her way.

We need feminism not pseudo feminism(Who says they can survive without men) there must be women empowerment but sometimes it often leads for them to take advantage and become pseudo feminist so both masculinity and pseudo feminist are equally threatening to our society we need feminism especially in India but must know how to differentiate this with pseudo feminist
Only support good human
"However, it is also a fact that feminism is often disparaged by many feminists themselves, like take an example of Neha Dhupia and the makers of Four more shots etc like filth. Feminists should fight the snakes present in them first then battle patriarchy and misogyny."

"I am not agreeing with you on this one. I mean look at the western world, look at their divorce rate , look at their broken families whereas in India divorce rate is lowest as well as families live and love each other.

"No one has a problem with Feminism. It is Pseudo Feminism that everyone has a problem with.

@Dhruv Rathee, Next topic for you: Why man should pay maintenance and alimony in a failed marriage. Talk about what you actually see in real life, not the exceptions."
"One of the major problems are those toxic тАЬfeministsтАЭ, who want more rights than men, considering themselves above men, wanting more pay without much work. This really spreads misinformation about what feminism actually means, thus most people think feminism is bad.
And about the alpha male stuff, they are just trying to catch up with the toxic тАЬfeministsтАЭ. ItтАЩs mostly about these insta and YouTube videos and reels, stupid edits, which started as a joke and now became a mentality. God help this world."

"You are right, the movie is meaningless"
тЭдтЭдтЭд
"EverythingтАЩs rightтАж..only the part where female friendships are better than male ones, I would like to object. Male friendships are way more understanding, uncompetitive and open in nature, very unlike the way you depicted here for the sake of content bias. And also not expressing emotions is kind of good for any person. Why bother anyone else with my issues. 
Again, in the Animal or the Kabir Singh movies, negative emotions were shown by the director, which you vehemently opposed. 
You have kinda objected your own statements for the sake of content I feel. Though equal rights are obviously should be mandated. Also, if you have connections with the corporates you would have known, currently hiring is more for the females over deserving males, for the sake of gender diversity. I am a student at an IIM, so am quite aware of this.
Please stop making content only for the sake of views, do some relevant in depth research first. We need talents anyhow, not some diversity quota or anything. This is 21st century, bro."
I think you should also make a video on Indian law against men
Why am I crying
"Well I am a feminist but I strongly advise to not to watch this video and try to understand what feminism is. This guy is using misdirection so strongly that is appalling. He is pushing his way of thinking and his own experience to dictate what something really means, however itтАЩs just completely a bias and illogical opinion. Rest if up to you how you want to interpret."
"Wow,you call them illogical and still argue that men and women who are doing equal jobs should get equal pay. Are you aware of the fact that women get mood swings during periods.and this was admitted by a feminist to me by mistake while she was trying to justify the menstrual leave.if she is getting mood swings and become unproductive for 4 to 5 days in a month,how can she expect payment equal to a man doing same job with full productivity for full month?"

"""You have gone mad. You are just trying to manipulate the common people. Nature has some laws, and we can't break them. People with no jobs, with no work, think about these things. A man and a woman can never be equal. But we have to give them great respect. Rather, I would say we all human beings should give respect to each other, whether it's male, female, or any sect from LGBTQ. Everyone cannot be equal, but should be given equal respect. You mentioned when a man cries, we say it doesn't suit you. Yes, that is very true. See, when a father is supposed to cry in front of his daughter, then how it looks and how society can accept that. As much as we try to break the laws of nature, it is simply inversely proportional to our peace. That is it!!"""

Feminism can and should always be about treating females with pride and equal opportunity to grow while тАЬthatтАЩs her choiceтАЭ needs to be denied too. Being a cheater cannot be her choice. 

Well made video Dhruv. Young Indians will learn a lot from u, already have i guess."
21:40 this movie is one of the most underrated movie in Bollywood the movie portrays with the amazing example that how people have made their mindset and rules for women which are not even in written in our constitution and  If am talking about four more shots and thank you for coming these movies are very poorly written and these movies are just like imaginary patriarchy and imaginary feminism without knowing the real meaning of these words they are just doing this for attention that's it

Jab tak Gender neutral laws nahi banaye jate India me tab tak ladke suffer karte rahenge aur feminism ka bhi koi Matlab nahi banega. Talking about equality while suppressing other make no sense.
"Agreed but kindly also explain that why few women think that they can slap a boy but i boy can not slap back.
Sab ke rights barabar hone chahiye. Politically, economically

What about girl expressing love or the better word is peeche padna is okay and if a boy does the same is crime. A girl kissing against boys will is just irritating and boy doing the same is crime.
I had a girlfriend and i know i chose a wrong girlfriend.
Where i had to take care of her or her feelings but she does not need to do the same. All above on the name of feminism. Bro if you get a girl like that. Ur life is finish."

"I also support your opinion but 
Nature has made some differences between men and women
These are not only physical but also mental. There is a slight difference between men and women. The brains of men is 11percent bigger than women it is not only size matters but some parts of brain also work differently in men.
The hormones in women and men are also different the main male hormone testosterone is responsible for muscle mass and fat distribution while the amount of testosterone is less in women.
Researchers have shown that male are more aggressive than women and by these hormonal differences they have more tolerance.
At the end I would like to tell that nature made us differently but not in the sense of discrimination. Female should also be treated equally, they should be paid equally.

"Amazing video, thanks for bringing the real definition of feminism to the world. However, I have lot of concerns where females are not aware of actual feminism, where they take the feminism and women empowerment to a whole different level, specially working wives. First of all, I understand where did this all come from, and the whole blame goes to dominating males or males patriarchy. After that the right women started raising their voice in favor of Feminism, however most of the women misunderstood it. One of those examples can be the laws where more power is given to Women, what an irony it is with regards to Feminism/Equality, and where 70-80% cases women take wrong advantage, and the other party which are men always become Victim. Does anyone talk about those Victims?"

"Actually.. use of word (feminism)is going wrong , Now the society is moving towards Matriarchy.."
"The video discusses the concept of feminism and patriarchy, aiming to dispel misconceptions and provide clarity on their definitions and implications in society.
Feminism is defined as advocating for political, economic, and social equality between men and women, not seeking superiority for either gender.
Patriarchy, on the other hand, refers to a social system where men hold control and power over women.
Examples are provided to illustrate how patriarchal ideologies impact both men and women negatively, perpetuating harmful norms and expectations.
The video highlights that feminism does not seek to pit men against women but challenges patriarchal structures that harm both genders.
It addresses the issue of toxic masculinity, which pressures men to conform to rigid gender roles and suppress emotions.
The video criticizes the portrayal of superficial feminism in media and calls attention to genuine feminist films and movements that advocate for equality and challenge patriarchal norms.
Instances of hypocrisy in society's treatment of gender issues are highlighted, including double standards in relationships and societal expectations.
The video emphasizes the importance of understanding and supporting genuine feminist movements that strive for equality and freedom for all genders.
Ultimately, it calls for the dismantling of patriarchal structures and the promotion of genuine equality and opportunities for all individuals, irrespective of gender."
"Its just like..chapri wale...Ramji ka nam jor sor se lenge....
Lekin..Yahi chapri log me..Ramji Jaisa koi values nahi he

..sab ke sab chapri he sale..."
"But one cannot deny the fact that in promoting one gender we have endangered males as a gender in the last few decades. No doubt an adult woman has equal cranial capacity. But, where were women during women wrestlers' protest? Sorry to say but an educated Indian woman is loyal to her family, kids but she is not loyal to women as class . And when I say this please don't tell me I am against women education. Women as a section  is losing class consciousness. Hardly anyone is talking about men issues under the head of feminism. It's very easy to blame patriarchal mindset  for every single problem. Yes, it is a problem but adult women and men have understanding to judge what is right and wrong. But we fail in realizing ground realities. It is very easy to blame patriarchy for everything despite seeing the social reality women themselves are the biggest promoters of it. There was a time when there were people like Shulasmith Firestone and Iravati Karve"

"we know what the meaning of Feminism in this era. they are making fight each other man and women in our society.they are making fool our woman..... i aggre with you Rathe Ji. but,in this era the feminist are talking about ""WOMAN RIGHTS"" ,not about MAN RIGHTS. they alaways fight with boys about WOMAN RIGHTS. some days before a woman said this proudly that '' she don't need a man in her life,,she can survive alone. also she don't need a men for birth a child,she can do this with dog spa*m.'' what the nonsence. this tocix feminist are washed the brain of our woman.. i was always  respect woman,,but not the feminist, who maked a bad impact to our society. i hate them alawys......Men and women complement each other, they are not rivals"

Pahle ke video mein aur aapke video mein language ka bahut fark a gaya
"Feminism isnot a concept that is now being portrayed in the society presently. True feminism should work towards giving an equal life especially to marginalized women and women in general interms of their capacity development, decision making power and participation in economic and overall development. The buzz that's created now is taking the society to completely opposite direction our ancestor women fought for."

"In villages women are not allowed to laugh, they can't go anywhere without taking permission, they are treated like slaves. And iron is a lot of women have accepted this."

"Women already have equal rights. Equal rights are not a problem anymore in most of the countries with democracy. In many countries like india , Women are given more rights and they are abusing that. Feminism makes no sense in 2024. Women talk about being independent and equality but still want alimony form husband because they want to live as a freeloader without working. In india Women get free public transport on many cities but men don't. Women think it's OK for them to have standards and choose a husband who is rich but if men want a beautiful girl as their wife and not an unattractive one then Women have a problem with that. It's ridiculous and it's definitely not about equal rights anymore and Women have more than enough rights."
"you are my only hope 
respect you bro for sharing your cool opinions"

Well the definition or the theory of feminism is admirable because of its utopian spirit while when it comes to practice there are massive differences at least what I've seen and experienced. Though I'm a English litrature student and i had a particular paper on feminism I can say The more one will delve into this rationally and most importantly without a bias and then coming out of it and looking into the society you won't find it's definition working in modern day world for both genders.

"There are limits of feminism. If you believe in equality then even men should have equal rights.
Rape on men is not defined.
Mental torture on men doesn't have any place in criminal code of the constitution.
Pseudo-feminism and neo-feminism are really dangerous.
Pay in office should be based on the work output.
Men are not payed for glamour but women are , so does it mean now ad makers should forcibly hire men for ads.
There is a fine line between equality and over expectation that shouldn't be crossed.
Women on work in mechanical, chemical engineering field get benefits of  working in first or general shifts and not at night so now should men protest on such facts.
Equality can be demanded but not favorism.
In karnataka women get 2000rs without working , free bus ticket now what will the feminists say on such inequality and will they fight for removal of some laws which favor females over males."
"Good video.... I agree and believe in equality of opportunity for everyone, but not equality of outcome. Equality of opportunity is something that anyone with any sense would support, but for equality of outcome, you have to confuse beyond belief to support equality of outcome. 
There are multiple reasons for pay gap, and one of them is gender but it's not the only reason. You say women in aggregate are paid less than men, well then we break down by age, we break it down by occupation, we break it down by interest, we break it down by personality. It's a multivariate analysis."

"If we dive deeper patriarchy as an ideology has evolved from thousands of societal needs it may seem as toxic but probably isnтАЩt. ItтАЩs easier to criticise the established norms than to create ideal societal architecture. Currently our society going through unprecedented paradigm shift with advent of social media over virtual outlets. ItтАЩs conflicting to support either. I feel we need to ditch these terms and for gender equality. USA is an obvious example where these ultra left liberal ideologies have wrecked the society blurring the lines of societal norms. I believe in gender equality in politics and work environment needed. Also needed is the respect for people on basis of merit, irrespective of their gender/religion/caste/tribe which is missing in our society."

Now talk about the things about which I don't agree with you 
1)Functional equality between man and woman 
Do you think in every sector man and woman (numbers)equality is necessary 
Ans-- in different sectors different ratio of man and woman is ideal lets  understand it with examples 

1) let's consider the gynacology department in this sector you have two option 
   a) equal man and woman 
   b) more woman and less man 
       Now which will be a better no doubt option    
       'a'  is possible but do you think the option 'b' will be better  than option 'a'


Now answer some of my questions 

Who will be better to take care of a child a father or a mother both giving the same effort?     
Obviously both are important but the ratio of mother /father should be more than one or less think about it 

2) let's now consider the defence sector what should be the ratio here
a) only man should be present 
b) some women should also present 
c) the ratio man and woman should be 1
d) woman should only present 

What do you think here 

My preference is in normal conditions option A in special conditions it may go to B, C and between C and D. D is practically almost impossible 

In the above I am saying about the battle field fighting 

For different sectors the ratio and preferrance should vary 

You may have question why I am saying that woman's preferance for job should be secondary 

My Ans--- think about the long term 
Let's consider 

1)both the father and mother of a child doing jobs and they came tired after office and cannot take proper care of their children 

Most probably the child will not become a good person, a good citizen of a country and a good human being 


2) Mother is the housewife and the father does a job and comes late at night/not taking care of the child 

In this situation the child has more possibility of being a good human if her mother takes care of it with much effort though there is a possibility that the child will be inhuman (but it is majorly controlled by the mother's guidance) 
  In this situation if both will contribute to the family it will be good but their first priority is to make their children a good human 

3) you know this situation


Now answering the question why care of a child is so important 

I) in most of the cases parents guidance decide the feature of a child (human/devil) 

The one for whom you are earning actually unknowingly you are destroying their feature are you actually doing right 
Here earning for them doesn't mean 100% for them but at least some % for them 

I am saying doing a job for a woman /over working of man is bad but consequences from this if ignored is very bad in long term so I  want we should avoid it 

I should also remind you about a very innovative, futuristic and developed idea of developed countries and educated people about child birth control 
what consequences happened  you and I we all know population crisis population collpse 

From no child and child adoption to at least 2 (2.1) child per woman 

These are  human findings I don't want to regret feature or let my generation regret for it in feature 

Now I am finishing it  
Insallaha I will talk about other partially or fully not agreed statements later 

Thanks for reading till now /mere scroller"
I agreed with you...  I will chang my mind * mental block *
"2:40  Feminism Definition - 
Feminism is the movement to fight for equal rights & opportunities that men have. 
It neglects rights of men totally.
Feminists do not raise their voice against lack of rights for men, unequal laws that favor women.

Who are Feminists i reality today?
In reality, Feminists are bunch of losers who want to blame men for their failures."

"*What is Islam?* 
Islam is the name of the religion, or more properly the тАШway of lifeтАЩ, which God (Allah) has revealed and which was practiced by all of the Prophets and Messengers of God that He sent to mankind.  Islam specifically means being in the state of submission to God, worshipping Him Alone, and reverently accepting and obeying His Law. 

*Who are Muslims?*
The Arabic word тАЬMuslimтАЭ literally means тАЬsomeone who is in a state of Islam (submission to the will and law of God)тАЭ.  The message of Islam is meant for the entire world, and anyone who accepts this message becomes a Muslim.

*Who is Allah?*
Often one hears the Arabic word тАЬAllahтАЭ being used in discussions regarding Islam.  The word тАЬAllahтАЭ is simply the Arabic word for Almighty God, and is the same word used by Arabic speaking Christians and Jews.  As a matter of fact, the word Allah was in use far before the word God ever came into existence, since English is a relatively new language.  If one were to pick up an Arabic translation of the Bible, one would see the word тАЬAllahтАЭ being use where the word тАЬGodтАЭ is used in English.  For instance, Arabic speaking Christians say that Jesus is, according to their canon belief, the Son of Allah.  In addition, the Arabic word for Almighty God, тАЬAllahтАЭ, is quite similar to the word for God in other Semitic languages. 

*Who is Muhammad?*
The last and final prophet whom God sent to humanity was the Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him.

*What are the Teachings of Islam?*
The foundation of the Islamic faith is belief in absolute Monotheism (the Oneness of God).  This means to believe that there is only one Creator and Sustainer of everything in the Universe, and that nothing is divine or worthy of being worshipped except for Him.

*What is the Quran?*
The Quran is the final revelation of Allah to all of mankind, which was spoken by Allah the Exalted Himself and conveyed through the Arch-Angel Gabriel in Arabic to the Prophet Muhammad, in sound, word and meaning.

*What does Islam say about Jesus?*

The Islamic belief about Jesus demystifies for us who the real Jesus was.┬аJesus in Islam was an extraordinary individual, chosen by God as a Prophet and sent to the Jewish people.┬аHe never preached that he himself was God or the actual son of God.┬аHe was miraculously born without a father, and he performed many amazing miracles such as healing the blind and the lepers and raising the dead тАУ all by GodтАЩs permission.┬аMuslims believe that Jesus will return before the day of Judgement to bring justice and peace to the world.┬аThis Islamic belief about Jesus is similar to the belief of some of the early Christians."

Homie didn't said anything.  I do sometimes think are you a part of some sort of propaganda against hindus? to show the religion bad or something? coz like let's be real we know more qnd more freedom is given to hindu females nowadays, atleast in cities and all but why is it that you always have to criticize us on something and will never mention the good thinks, and how I've said all this, ppl might come and call me hindu nationalist or andhbhakt or bla bla bla whatever, but if a muslim person raises voice against ur videos ppl will just understand them without saying anything.

At the same time when a feminist let it be a male or female raise his/her  voice against inappropriate activity showing masculanity by  men should also raise voice against when it is done by women.( just the last example of a rich girl beating poor boy in public )
Just a mere silence of not supporting the act is an indirect way of supporting it."

Being adarsh bahu there is no 'regressive character' it's the dignity of women we have in our culture the reason why WE RESPECT WOMEN and you're simply denying them of their basic principle? Like if a woman has a man who respects her loves her isn't it natural for her to do everything according to his man? We have all been raised in a home where we have this basic principle of 'FAMILY'. A person who has studied from abroad lives outside India has no audacity to reflect us our very own culture please shut up

Nice video bro
"I don't know about Feminism. But I know that you are all who talk about Human equality, they have to know that Mans and Woman can not be equal every field. But I think you think from above. If we want to talk about the equality of men and women, we have to come back to the ground level and then talk. I will give you an example otherwise you will not understand. Example: (I used to work as a worker at the new thermal power plant in Rampal in Bangladesh and I used to pull a cable 30 to 40 meters from the ground and it was as thick as a hand. 
When it comes to equality, girls have to work here too and I don't think that a girl who makes people work in a place that talks about feminism is a man.) So I think that men and women need equal rights, but don't come to talk about equal rights everywhere. If you want to come and work in a place like me, then I will accept your words.
 I hope you will see my comment. Thank you"

"Why can't feminism be just called equality? 
When we say all castes are equal, we dont call it Dailitism... we call is equality and casteism.
When we make the thing specific to one side, the other side, starts to become portrayed as a bad actor.
Would have been great if you covered Masculinity as well. Toxic feminism and toxic masculinity as well... covering entire scope.

Your view points on gender equality is bang on, but your viewpoints on everyone being able to do everything is incorrect. Majority of men cannot be caretakers, hence majority of nurses are women(its not a societal structure alone, its their strength), just as majority of women are not territorial and aggressive(which puts them in disadvantage) when it comes to roles which demand it. 

Trying to portray it as Black & White helps in engagement building, but facts and reality are always in shades of gray."

"@dhruvrathee 
Bro i think your arguments are baseless. Feminism wants equal rights for men and women whereas according to our constitution women have more rights than men. Women trap Men in fake cases becauses they have special rights. Many lives got destroyed because of such women because nobody will believe that a women has done something wrong or abused a man. The alpha males you are calling Chapri are actually criticising such Feminism because it ultimately meant equal rights. You can see in a video the woman is slapping a man and nobody is stopping her but if that would have slapped just once in return public would have start beating him or he could have been sent to Jail. If you are such humanist then reply to me  otherwise it's obvious that you are one of those fake feminists who make such videos to get view"

"Feminism has been a cancer since its inception. 

Feminism was never about ""equality."" It was always about reparations, retribution, and restitution against men by using the govt.

The fact is that, instead of feminism, we should use the word gynocentrism. Gynocentrism is the root cause of all problems.

Masculinity is not for the feminine to define. Because men and women are not interchangeable widgets."

"Hey Dhruv, the video was really good, but there were some things missing here. For example, the current laws where a father can't even get a DNA test done should have been addressed. On the other hand, under the guise of feminism, how many boys are accused and trapped should have been discussed. If a girl accuses someone, they are thrown straight into jail without even taking their statement. This is something that should have been talked about too."

When i was 16, 17 years old i came across many fake and made up videos about feminism. My thoughts changed when i met men and women who adhered to the true feminism. Which preached for equality and in many cases they even cared for mental health of men. In my experience, the men i grew up with, most told me to toughen up and not to cry cause i should act like a MAN and not show emotions. Most women in my life, told me i could cry and show what i feel. They never judged me. They asked me how i felt. тЭд"

Lekin toxic feminist ka ky ?
Yes finally someone explained thiss>>>>>
This video should be taught in schools.
"I rarely comment on any videos but I really want to thankyou for this video. 
When someone asks me to explain feminism or to justify my emotions against their patriarchal behaviour, it makes me feel so angry and helpless to be honest. How can something which is so logical and simple be so difficult to understand. The reason is simple- people who talk about fake feminism more than feminism were sexist from the very beginning. 
So yes, sometimes I try to explain, sometimes it's too hard so I get angry instead, and sometimes I just tell them that you are wrong and should read up on it because I am not going to spoonfeed you the information.
So ladies, I know it takes a toll on you..but let's go deeper in it..feel worse about the society but also stay positive within because change is happening and changes will happen for the good. 
There are feminists, men, who don't feel insecure everysingle time someone talks about feminism, who don't feel attacked, women who don't feel like they are betraying their better halves while talking about this. 
Once I was explaing about women rights to one of my friends and she tells me after listening to everything that yes all of that is fine but you can't hate on boys and should speak about them as well. And I was so surprised because I genuinely thought that she was getting me. I reminded her that literally nothing I had said had ANYTHING going against men particularly. It's the society. If that society comprises of those men (sexist) too then why should we be shy to speak up against them? Secondly there is absolutely nothing wrong in talking about men suffering from the patriarchal society, because they do..a lot! But saying ' talking about their sufferings' in response to women's suffering is just kind of comparing the two and taking no responsibility and sort of saying shut up and stop whining. Why can't we talk about both.
 Feminism also doesn't mean that if I have 10 mins to say something, I give five to women and 5 to men. That is so stupid! Somedays I can talk entirely about men and somedays entirely about women and that doesn't make anyone a lesser person. i can talk about women's rights for hours and it's FINE. it's needed. We are all in the same boat. Men are suffering without them realising that they are suffering. 
And being a women, explaining the most basic of the things..I can only imagine how many more years it will take for things to even come anywhere closer. 
So ladies please start getting offended and asking the right questions xD"

Thank you sir тЭдтЭд
Dhruv rathee is a masterpiece
"Women can get sex easily, cheating is an easy thing for ladies. Thats not the same case for men."
"Current affairs gives a different view. I never saw a feminist stand against laws which are made to punish hard working innocent men. Look at the number of fake cases file against men, look at the amounts that Shikar dhawan and Shami had to pay and social embarrassment. Those are hard working men no feminist never had them as role models instead why feminists choose people like Karan Johar over Shami or Shikar. How would you explain current events @dhruvrathee ? Equal rights starts with equal laws. Instead of equal seats in the parliament ask for equality. I understand you glanced over menтАЩs loneliness but it was an area to be explored and you should research on those topics you can release a playlist instead of a video."

"a great video Dhruv, indeed a great video, very very very informative...
BUT
Would have been far better, if you had added another section, ane called out all the people who actually believe in the same thoughts that you explained in the video also if you had added a conversation with like-minded people in the video, and proposed a systematic approach for people, so that they can lead the change around them starting from their families.
I know that change would be hard, especially in joint families but in nuclear families where both the in charges (husband and wife) are in charge of decisions, it can lead to a ripple effect and lead to a better society.
I know it would make the video much longer and that probably won't be good for your channel.
But I'd really appreciate if you could make a second part and include such solutions too...

So basically everyone's english is not correct
"Guys, You may or may not agreee with me but A family, Govt. Or Organization runs properly when a certain person take control over a certain thing and thats totally acceptable and necessary thats why women are chosen for handling household responsibility and men for outside work. Both responsibilities have their own set of challenges... Women are good in organizing tasks sensibly while men needs to be tough all the time. No doubt girls are also tough and physically strong but A man can lift 400 kg while women are limited to 200Kg.. why?  Obviously There are restrictions made by god and nature which should be okay."

"Be careful what you wish for. If you go with the textbook definition (original) of Feminism, many will agreed to it. However, the present 3rd wave feminism is totally different. Many original feminists also reject the present day feminism. The present day feminism is totally EVIL in nature. Its not about equality anymore but totally a men hating cult, destruction of family values (nuclear family), promiscuity in women as empowerment, promoting single parenthood, choosing career more than raising your own kids and many more. Please do some more research before you believe anything Dhruv said. He spin this argument in totally different (intentional) way and PLEASE do your own research on the present day feminism. Check what the western countries are going through because of the 3rd wave feminism. I believe everyone is equal and should be given equal opportunities. However, i dont believe in equal outcome. Anyone should be judge of his/her merits and not because of whats between their legs. The 3rd wave feminism cannot even define a WOMEN. Don't just blindly believe what someone said on the internet BUT DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH."

"Feminism is cancer for the society. 
If you are a man then act like a man . Adverse effects of feminism is destroying american and European society. Don't allow this feminism bullshit in india . Only hardcore patriarchal societies can win the struggle for existence. Men and women are born different. 
If you are a man then becoming strong is the only option you have. 
Long live patriarchy."
"Bro's literally trying to supply where demand is higher. 

He's passionate businessman, he loves his job.

And the thing is bro researched network [ Network is a thing accepted & created by society(society means majority  of people) ]. That's why he's being taught by so called society (which is brainwashed by some people).

Somethings he just said is complete against the will of Universe. And the people who loved this video is because they trust this man because he gained trust of other people.

The thing is Patriarchy is intellectually equal for human beings."

"I hear feminism and patriarchy need the hour. But it is unable to understand. Finally, this video helped me understand."
"Men also have huge pressure to have higher status then women because women (working or not) don't choose men  of lesser status to marry or date, even if they choose that's very less %, and mostly they ultimately cheat or if not are always verbally abusing or taunting those men.
So the problems in your video are really surface level, its more deeper than that, a psychological problems.
If a women is being degraded, whether it's, mother, wife, sister not fighting back is indeed coward, if left once those same people will do again if lesson not taught properly tho I do agree most of the things in your video."
"Consider the following questions:

Despite advocating for feminism, why do some people still adhere to the tradition of the male being older than the female at marriage?

Although advocating for the abolition of caste distinctions, why do many individuals still engage in marriages within the same caste, often citing respect for their parents as an excuse? Furthermore, why do they continue to call Brahmins at the time of marriage, prompting reflection on the necessity of Brahmins in contemporary marital ceremonies?"""

Those people who happen to, unfortunately, mistake feminism for pseudo-feminism are none other than the ignorant people who voice their 'valuable opinion' on social media creating a choas. Lets normalise the fact that we need to do some research in topics and then come up with one's opinion. Else we all know half filled pot makes the most noise!
Thank you Dhruv sir for clarifying the most hot topics of these times which was the need of the hour."

Men and women are not the same never will be but everyone needs equal rights. There are no fixed solutions just don't put men and women in competition.
Your argument is correct but sadly most girls today are learning feminism from sadak chaap actresses like Deepika Padukone who say its ok to sleep outside of marriage and other cheap Instagram influencers.

When women are given the equal rights and the privileges of a man they misuse it. For example false accusations of domestic violence,r*pe and molest*tion or they want equal pay but don't want to do the equal amount of work. 
No one talks about the poor working conditions of a male laborer, the low wages but what are they talking about....... that how could man earn 20 lpa while a woman only earns less than lpa like no educational background check, experience, years of hardwork.
In ALMOST ALL THE CASES OF REAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE no one is actually supporting the man(whether he was the one who abused or got abused)."

I believe we should support our girls if they want to do something but, also teach them our values so that next generations can flourish. I don't believe in westren feminism where women is commercialized and a mother would not care about her children but, others' children for money, she won't clean her house but, others' for money, she won't stay with her husband and cheat with other men, thats all F ed up."

"The current definition of feminism is man hating no matter if you believe otherwise, we all know how women already have same rights as men perhaps even more, I would say socially its not quite there but everything a men can do legally a women can well do as well.

I think you focused too much on toxic masculinity even though it wasn't title of this video, we know that its bad but perhaps you should also mention how feminism shouldn't be taken as reason to hate men in general.

Please don't incline towards either of the side too much balance is the key."

"there are many field where women can't have equal right as men....like sports, but they should get get equal right in office work etc where they can provide equal output ...we have to understand that man are women are different"
Every things has pro and cons ... dawn of feminism has giving freedom to women but but at the same time led to singlehood mindset in man.. feminism itself has brought many imbalance in relationship dynamics.. which you can see as divorse rate in socity beacuse of all those female rights they dont need man anymore for protection and security  but only their sperm for children.. and all the laws against man after divorse is obvious ...

"Well i don't feel that we need these type of movements or ideologies and identify ourselves with it be it feminism or male chauvinism and i also agree that nobody has the right to justify cheating through this popular misconception that 'men will be men' or by woman such as 'kudiyo ka zamana' both are equally wrong in every sense and can't we ensure justice in every aspect i mean both genders should be treated equally, law and order should be maintained, justice should be ensured and legal, political, personal rights should be given i mean i believe in the fundamentals of islam and as a muslim i believe we don't need these type of movements and ideologies to identify with Allah SWT has guided us in every aspect. I can explain how Islam has raised the status of women which was not the case before Prophet Muhammad Peace be upon him and made them equal in various aspects and rulings and i can prove it see men and women both are commanded by Allah SWT to believe in Allah only and both were commanded to perform salah (Namaz) and the reward which both the genders get in the hereafter is also the same and that includes the Transgender (niether a man nor a woman) too i mean the reward the punishment and justice is equivalent for all mankind and that is the reason Islam is a peaceful religion for the whole humanity. I mean islam gives women the right to express herself and that applies for men also islam has given women the right to own property, to buy and sell, to inherit, to give charity to give gifts and these rights are there for both the genders. Also, you cannot take wealth of a woman without her consent and a woman also cannot take wealth of a man without his consent. In addition, Islam honors women as mothers too and as mothers women are treated with kindness and as mothers they are respected and obeyed greatly. Islam always educates us and the translation which i am quoting its there in the Quran too and it states that 'the heaven lies at the mother's feet' i.e. the best resort to reach paradise is through one's mother and islam forbids disobeying one's mother niether as muslims we are allowed to make our mother's angry nor we are allowed to utter even a single word of disrespect towards our parents and mother specially. Here it should be also noted that the mother's rights are more than those of a father. Islam honors women as wives and urges the husband to treat his wife in a good and a kind manner and a wife has rights over her husband and the husband too in the same manner has rights over his wife except the husband has a degree over her as a husband is responsible for the household's expenditure and is responsible for taking care of the family affairs. 

Also Islam states that the best among the muslim men is the one who treats his wife in the best possible manner and it is forbidden for a husband to acquire wife' money without her consent.

Islam honors women as daughters and encourages for good parenting and emphasises on educating the daughters and that applies for men also and Islam states that by raising her daughters in a healthy manner will ensure a great reward in the Hereafter.

Islam honors women as Sisters and Aunts

Islam enjoins us as muslims and encourages us to maintain ties of kinship and as muslims we are forbidden to severe those ties and that applies for both men and women 

Also women can run their own business if it lies within the boundaries of Halal i.e 
. Permissible and their Parda i 
.e Veil does not get impacted then women can work and have their businesses also 

So to conclude, both men and women have the right to lead a decent life without facing agression or being wronged. Also Islam ensures that justice is ensured for both men and women, both get equal rights and  law and order is also same for both men and women and spiritually also both men and women get the same reward in the hereafter. There are few exceptions for both men and women at some place women have more rights and at some place men have more rights but i feel islam guides us for a more balanced and peaceful lifestyle so as muslims we don't need these type of ideologies and movements. I agree there are those muslims also who don't practice islam and do wrong things then also we have sharia law which allows  justice for the oppressed and all the oppressors, transgressors and criminals get punished for their evil acts also if the justice is not ensured in this Duniya it will be definitely ensured in the Hereafter so i feel as muslims we don't need these type of ideologies for ourselves be it misogyny or be it feminism."

"Equality is always dangerous. We should strive for Equanimity/Justice. 
To all these Alpha males and Animal movie lovers - I have just 1 point. 
Imagine the movie with Ranbir Kapoor as the son of a labourer in a real world.....all your Alphas and gammas will disappear.

If you give the same normal printed books to student with normal vision and a blind student for their exams...it is equality but not justice.

We should be careful about feminism as to how its understood now. Feminism wants to bring Equality. It says that women should have ""same"" rights as men.
So if Men play 5-setter tennis matches and women play 3-setter tennis matches for the entire tournament, then how can we have equal Pay to both??
If Men in military do the heavy lifting which obviously women cannot then how can there be equal pay??
In another situation a female and male CEO should have SAME Pay as the work effort is same for both.

Vice-versa - If women take 6 months maternity leave, then should Men also take 6 months leave? No....right, because there is no justice there.

We want to force everyone to have 1 spouse, and make prostitution illegal for all - Equality. So what will happen to a 28 year old person whose spouse is long-term sick or becomes physically incapable in satisfying their partner. Also if this person is not capable of living alone...then what will happen to them??

We can take this concept further - If entry fee for good Medical colleges is 50 lac rupees for all then there is equality but how will a equally talented child of a rickshaw driver ever dream to become a doctor?? There should not be reservations but apply different fee structures based on economic background.

If we all think about JUSTICE rather than EQUALITY or FEMINISM all our world problems will be solved."

"I appreciate how easily you've described this sensitive topic.  I particularly liked one key aspect of this discussion: females always receive emotional support from their male or female friends, but in the case of males, they often cannot get emotional support from their male or female friends. As a result, they are unable to share their pain, leading to feelings of loneliness, which can ultimately result in suicide."
It's important to understand the difference between believing and being toxic. I can't say this video was a justification on patriarchal toxicity because there is always a different side of a coin which is ignored for the convenience. Could have been better.

"Absolutely pointless waffling.
Who doesnтАЩt know the bookish definition of feminism or the concept of equality!? 

The real world is all about snatching power from one another, feminism isnтАЩt anything different - it is a superiority movement. In practical life, all you see is women cherry-picking the privileges they can get from both ends of the spectrum. They are weak when they want alimony, fight on the frontlines, do extremely dangerous and dirty jobs or ever take accountability for their fate. They are strong when they want more freedom to take ultra unreasonable decisions in life and there is some kind of incentive attached to it - you just cannot make it up."
"Correct me if IтАЩm wrong here but I believe the whole ideology of feminism is just straight up bias and b.s. I know this statement is quite controversial and might hurtтАЩs some individuals feelings but hear me out I give you the explanation. 

LetтАЩs suppose I throw everyone on a deserted forest like we do back in era of Homosapiens and a life threatening animal pops out, itтАЩll be mens who jump to ensure the safety of the whole tribe, womens and childrens. So nature designed men and women to fulfill their own duties. The whole concept of feminism emerges from the modern society which just want mens to loose their natural instincts and become soft because if they do back on their natural instincts the one who are going to suffer the most are puppet masters up top on the ladder. 

And when Dhruv said тАЬis it necessary for a female to go out make their careerтАЭ my answer to this is тАЬof course you can doesnтАЩt mean you shouldтАЭ I mean only if all the mens develop some courtesy towards women rights and just provide for the family in a healthy manner then why would a woman go out to thrive and hustle. They can just take care of the wellbeing of the family and live happily, (ofc IтАЩm not saying donтАЩt educate yourself and donтАЩt have any hobbies & interest and just throw your life on your someone elseтАЩs happiness). I donтАЩt know how I express myself in least upsetting way possible because most of the Indians are quite sensitive and dramatic in taking this types of Philosophy.

p.s. - don't label be orthodox because of that deserted forest example it was just an ' imaginary way of expressing that men and women ain't the same'.

Dhruv, IтАЩm looking forward to hear from you what your thoughts on what I just said."

Just like the last example in your video. You said that the feminists didn't support the rich girl for her non-civil behavior. 

Then, why didn't any feminists step forward to support or help the boy.

"In my region feminism is very misunderstood. here feminism means anti-men. here people are forced to believe that feminism is anti-Islamic which is totally wrong. in actual, feminism is against those cultures, those traditions which had made our Lifes really difficult. Women believe that men do not suffer from emotional pain, they are strong, he is considered as an iron man even when he is totally broken.
 if you have control over your women, your daughter, your sister. if you are able to force them to marry the one u want then you are a real man otherwise you are not.

"Men's suicidal rate is more, not only because of unemployment or loneliness, Its also because of emotional abuse they get from their respective partner. Fake rape cases, Dowry cases, abuse cases are prime example. Parents also getting jailed because of wrong & fake filed cases. Women's having extramarital affairs but still blaming their partner for everything, even if they are the one who is wrong. Because our society still thinks that only a man can do extramarital affairs. Alimony greed are also playing a big part. Not just that recently laws got way more baised for women's rights which is good, but many women are totally exploiting these laws according to their liking. Father's getting seperated from their kids, can't meet them for months, sometimes years. Many men are getting jailed in false cases with no proof & spending years in jail throwing their social life away for those crimes they never committed. Millions of man have marched and have been asking for "" Purush ayog "" from government & SC for proving their innocence and to tell there side of the story, but they are totally being ignored. Because of no help from our society or from our Laws, Things like these are happening in our society."

why u don't saw about less women in millitary or sewage workers.
why women don't choose men who r not up to their mark; is this not inequality
lastly why do we not have gender neutral laws, and for your knowledge it was these feminism groups that protested against gender neutral laws. good luck manipulating dhruve
i know how to treat women, she is another person with same rights, i will never ask her for something she does't like not will i force my opinions on her. for her career, i am more than happy to support at at every stage. i just want loyalty and kindness in return, something that has been ruined by feminist."

Dhruv sir I do agree with the Most of the things you said in this video but there is a difference between Femenism And toxic femenism its same as toxic Masculinity. If you look around in today's gen the society is more of matriarchal rather than patriarchal the laws in India are baised you cannot deny it by saying women are hearing this or thus if we look at stats men comment more suicide than women even if we agree Men and Women are same and equal still men are gona criticised for not providing for their family it's just a fact and this nature as well Men and women are not Equal But Justice Should be Equal for both

"I totally agree. Equal rights should be given to Women. But what about rights of men? In the Lucknow case no feminist supported the act, everyone was quiet. Isn't the moral obligation for real feminists to speak against that girl's act instead of sitting quietly? Did Dhruv Rathee even mention the case of Jasleen Kaur and Saravjeet Singh?? Jasleen is enjoying her life after putting a false rape case against Saravjeet. What about the crores of Saravjeets residing in India? Don't they have rights? If you can openly make a complete video criticizing Animal, then why not a single dedicated video on these Pseudofeministic movies? A woman who wants to live peacefully with complete freedom is a moral obligation of the society and of course every real educated man should respect this. But every woman like Jasleen Kaur who take advantage of the Women rights to exploit men should be heavily criticized by the real feminists instead of sitting quietly. Fake rape cases and fake dowry cases are unimaginably rising in India. This is a failure of our so called feminists. I hope Dhruv Rathee must have some stupid arguments to justify these things as well.

And I want to know how many girls prefer getting married to a man who earns lesser than her or who is still unemployed. In my 30 years of life I have not seen a single such case (i agree my sample space is small although). Equal rights is a mutual term. A woman should respect the rights of a man and vice versa. A man raping a woman is heinous, i totally agree. At the same time, exploiting a man by taking advantage of govt laws favorable towards women is as heinous as rape."

FEMINISM CAN'T BE AN EXCUSE FOR WOMEN TO GET AWAY WITH THEIR MISCONDUCTS nor anyone should accuse someone for that."

"In between patriarchal and feminist there's another thought exist . Its says your ability equals to your responsibility. In this law a person got responsibilities by which abilities they have. And if they didn't have any kind of ability then still they can take responsibility by their own choice. but its also prohibited something for in all men or in all women or in all human .Its called sharia. and its also work in flexibility . Like in different situations its give you permission of those are prohibited to you before but only for short time,, islam doesn't support patriarchal or matriarchal. Don't think I'm here to promoting islam , we are with humanity."
"in last i want to mention, On August 23, 2015, Kaur, a former student of Delhi University posted a picture of a man and alleged that he passed obscene comments at her during an argument on road. After the post went viral, Singh was arrested a local police (Arvind kejriwal and many celebraties like parineeti chopra was in support of that girl) after 2 years of fighing case she said sorry this was a mistake and there are more case like visnu tiwari who served 30 years for a fake ra*e case and there are many more .

it is scary that a girl can ruin your whole life with a little act , indian penal court should take this thing seriously so that we can live equally."

"Sir 6 month pahele daal dete iss topic pe video, mere previous semester main aaya tha yea topic"
"Feminism itself means Gender Equality in terms of Rights. Problem lies in the different different IQ levels of different different people so that they never understand what the actual meaning of feminism means. They often confuse the word 'Feminism' with 'Toxic Feminism' which can also be called as Matriarchy.

Current Situation of Indian Society is that we are still fighting against our Patriarchal society for a Neutral Society but there is a problem. Low IQ People whether Girls or Boys, have made a bypass bridge towards Matriarchal Society, due to which fake cases, promiscuity, extramarital affairs, and other things in girls is seen. This is going to make Indian Society worse than ever. Our Whole Constitution is Feminist as well as Anti-Men.

I would like you to make a video on this topic also."
So the whole conclusion is that itтАЩs verse of what we say women should be equal in every aspect. Nope a men should get equal right in emotional terms.
Indian women themselves are most patriarchal...there actions and words never match.... But they want selective changes according to convenience...

"When you can use lines from 'Upanishads ' why not from 'Quran'?  I don't mean to make it a religious thing. But when u include Religion, u shd include all religions r8?? and  entire content is childish. When u talk about work, physical means not according to body parts my dear. It's about physical strength. Few works involves Heavy physical strength nd danger. why not feminist demand equal job in those works also? You talk like in every rescue operation they say ""ladies n children first"" that means they are patriarchal?  Feminism is necessary but to what extent? that's the limit FEW feminists need to know."
"Most men ( who can think ) are okay with the idea of feminism but do not want to call themself feminist, because of the word feminine being present. I think it stems from deep rooted toxic masculinity where anything feminine being related to men is considered to be shameful or disrespectful. For example.. Ye kya ladkiyo jaise ro rha hai, ye kya ladkiyo jaise baal lambe kiye hai, chudiya peheni hai kya humne, etc."

"Yes Dhruv you aare absolutely right Hinduism is very bad religion as it says that for a woman her husband is her god.... Which is absolutely wrong husband is a demon isn't it..... Happiness of family doesn't matter.... Means you should give immense pain to them....... Woman should listen to her father or husband? Nah its silly to listen to them just disobey them..... And the concept of aradhangani ...its a fantasy only isn't it...? 
But look at Islam its so good it says that women is your kheti.... So nice and one can marry his or her own brother, sister, niece, uncle etc. So open minded society it is.... Having 4 wives is cool.... And yes what about 3 talaq and halala system..... 
Gender inequality exists only in Hinduism not in any other religion so use the example of it in every feminism video.....

You used many examples from Hinduism to tell how women are treated unequally ( which is absolutely ridiculous becz you yourself had not read the scriptures and have no particular refrences) but what about Islam where women is called a Kheti of man and Halala system and Tripal talaq anx many more...... It's not religion Feminism is a concept of political scuence and as a political science student I want to say that explain it politically rather than connecting it with only one religion or community."

Can you tell me where is the equality in indian laws and how many ""feminists"" opposed women centric laws or even talked
about male abuse, domestic violence again men? 

Can you tell me how many feminists are fighting for men's rights??

This video is the classic example of how someone can be very distant from the ground reality and using ostrich approach, would just bury his head in the dictionary definition of words...people don't talk about 1800 or 1900's feminism because they were not alive back then...

How many feminists are protesting against women's reservation? Equals don't need discriminatory privileges 

This is just like islam apologists, whenever you highlight their flaws..they come back at you saying this is not islam..."

"Videos Thumbnail :- Toxic feminism

Video topic :- real feminism and smart integration of toxic feminism with 
patriarchy.

Video problem :- pointing out ""alpha the males"" but not pointing out ""pseudo feminist influencers"" who says men are dog

Yes there are some self claimed feminists who thinks four more shots was real feminism

logical Solution :-
 using more gender neutral term instead of things like patriarchy which often describes only evil men and feminist which depicts only strong and bold females.

Rather use and create more gender neutral terms.

About hypocrisy :- well everyone is a hypocrite unless you are a god or something. I have heard many feminists saying BE A MAN."

"I'm feminist but after marriage in educated family also its hard to handle the drama and fights on quality and feminist specially when you live with in laws. You are working and still have to look into all home chores and house work.  eventually you start becoming or start accepting patriarchal thought just to ignore fight with husband or in-law as we live in India to avoid divorce many working women who were feminist before marriage and changed after marriage just to avoid fight, drama and divorce.  
 Before marriage, Educated people (In laws) talk about quality when you are working and and after marriage at home start there behaviour and thoughts same as patriarchal thought.

"Hey Dhruv I understand your points on feminism and all the points in the video are great but you still did not address the fact that 
1. There is no provision in our constitution which allows a man to file for a divorce in case his wife is involved with another man and not pay alimony
2. A woman can file a fake case of rape on you and police will lock you up without any evidence
3. If the case is found to be false, the woman will not bear the consequences 
In these cases, a man's life is ruined until he proves his innocence but the woman can walk freely how with equal rights"

The day when both males & females will worth value of people's mindset then it will be a  real mindset and a woman should always take care of their baby although she is a working woman, then we will support that it's actually a feminism movement..

  While people's thoughts are being discussed, I would also like to share with you some things that a man told us, Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) told us what are the basic rights of a woman, and when people abuse their daughters.  When they were born, they were buried alive and felt ashamed, so Hazrat Muhammad (pbuh) explained what the position of a woman is, and how holy Allah has made a woman, and what a woman does in a society.  What are the rights of a father, of a son, of a brother, of a husband.
If we examine these things carefully, the world will become a paradise and there will never be any debate between men and women.

"I think women are the one who bear children
So when it's time to bear and nurture children women should take break from career because naturally fathers can't do what mothers can
So here mother is superior than father when it comes to take care of children and hence to create stronger human being which again in turn will contribute to the stronger community
So we can't say that even if in pregnancy ot post pregnancy women should be paid equally in jobs
Similarly when men are jobless and women are earning because of anything causing disability for a man to earn it's fine...that time women can support and otherwise men are superior....so it's simple
They are not equal at all stages of life 
Somewhere women are stronger and somewhere men are stronger
Equality doesn't mean every stage similarities"
"First, we are human beings and each of us has an equal right to have access to each field and to gain knowledge and manage the field for the betterment of our mother earth through the exploration of talent that each of us has. ItтАЩs about the revolution on the conservative cultural practice through the proper co-operation and co-ordination between men and women with awareness, instead of hiding the talent and emotion within us due the pressure of fake cultural practices."

The real thing is feminism Is good but today's women's Thinking is going on toxic feminity
"Bro ask a feminist if she want to marry an unemployed man. Go and check the real society. 
Imagine Karo druv ka wife Kal use cheat kare and they got divorce. What will happen?
She will get 50% of his property. And monthly alimony aside.
I am saying just one case.
1st wave was good,
2nd wave was good,
Now it's just a joke..
Let me tell you one thing there is no rights for men.
And Druv if you got time than answer how should we understand this things?
By definition or by practice?"

Phyllis Schafly was a hero. She fought to save the lives of many women who were murdered in the wombs of their mothers. Men and women have equal dignity but we play different roles. The hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world.
"Feminists dont say they are against men ... Their actions they are against men ... I don't need to tell which speaks louder than the other
I would love it if feminists did what they claim to do!!
Just like feminists ask for menstrual leaves, do they ever take into account that it will force companies to further exploit male workers in a country where the workforce is paid less than 50% of the value the worker adds to the company?
Have feminists ever demanded laws asking for better working conditions for men since more than 90% of the workplace deaths are men?
Have feminists have ever influenced the government to take steps towards education of boys as 85% of India's child labour force are them?
Have feminists have ever asked for housing facilities for men since 92% of the homeless people are men?
Since circumcision is clearly a human rights violation, have feminists ever demanded the WHO/UN to stop it rather promote it as a HIV/AIDS prevention?
Here is a cool story-:
In the third wave we see feminists significantly advocate for gay rights. Do you know that male-male contact is 81% of the time responsible for STD's? So after feminists advocated for these and the cases of HIV/AIDS increase, WHO, UNAIDS started special movement to circumcise baby boys citing that it reduces HIV transmission by 60-70% in male-female interactions also citing that circumcision causes childhood trauma, infections and even leads death of individuals. The self acclaimed feminist organisation openly allowed the murder of men to avoid STDs for women. Also Operah Winfrey, another feminist who openly use the foreskin for women's beauty products.
Now tell me feminists aim for equality. Hypocrite Liars"
well when you say that women should be paid equally i agree then the womens should also start to take up hard labour intensive jobs as the man.Then we can say that women and men are really equal
I recommend you to study Professor Ann Oakley of Genders studies.

"All these European mentality entering India is ruining our teens and youths and giving half knowledge, Indian Society was great in ancient times because we never talked about feminism and all because rights were always equal for both genders and no one even thought of feminism or smash patriarchy

Every right is same for both men and women by default and we at least shouldn't fight aur debate for all these rights... It's just wasting of precious time of life

This is all about social conditioning unfortunately.. brainwashing itna zyada hai k mahilayen aware nahi hai apne rights k baren mein.. lot of women are confused regarding feminism.. gender is politocal and sex is natural and that ks where the confusion lies.. very true that men are also becoming victims of patriarchy
"To us Humans, we can never differentiate between what is Pure Good and what is Pure Evil.
Synthesis solves Thesis and Antithesis but after some time the Synthesis itself becomes Thesis or Antithesis and the cycle goes on and on.
Humans can't understand what is Pure Good and Evil.
That is why we need The Creator Himself to tell us what is Right and Wrong.
Read Quran my friends it has all the answers to the problems of Humanity."

"Feminism in its roots is great, equality amongst men and women is what should be the main goal and there should be conversations and how to exactly accomplish those things, while having an understanding of each other. However, I feel modern day feminism has been perverted into instead of having equality, they rather have superiority and completely voids out any other male or dissenting opinion and conversation that they deem as тАЬmisogynisticтАЭ. People rather scream at each other than actually talk and think things through logically."

Hardly anybody would be against equal pay provided the output also has to be equal. What feminism is doing is it's just matching equal pay without the output. Eg Women cricket player should not be paid equal as more than 90% of the revenue is brought in by the men. And people saying that women's cricket didn't get time to evolve can wait a 100 years and see the situation not changing much

"Mera manna hai Party mein ek thappad wife ko agar husband marde uske wajah se divorce Nehi hona chahiye aur to aur wife bhi agar ek thappad marde party mein toh bhi divorce Nehi hona chahiye.

Jisne galti ki hai usko agar baad mein galti ka ehsaas ho jaye to divorce ki jarurat Nehi jai. Ek thappad ke wajah se divorce thoda jyada ho jayega.

Lekin agar galti karne Wale ko galti ka ehsaas bilkul Nehi hai to wo bhi patriarchy ya toxic feminism ki shikar hai.

Us case mein divorce ho sakta hai.

Dhruv you need to understand the problem is not feminism its toxic feminism. Women in today's date are well educated and are dependent enough to be on their feet but that doesn't mean they do not need a man. A man need a women and a women needs a man. Right now women need equal pay in the fields that does not generate the same amount of money for women as they make for men. Honestly now its reversed now women wants to feel superior that's the problem. In my opinion both men and women have their own sets of tasks and they should do it irrespective of their pride.

Why do girls marry only government boys? Equality was said at that time.

Why don't girls go to any force? This is equality for all girls.
What about Indian laws
"So call feminist also problem of Real feminizam , no doubt women have right to wear anythink but somewhere there is thought that small and tight cloths are the only right if any girl like to wear sadi kurti then she is BEHENJI and backword mindset.
When the time to learn feminizam everyone backstage but time to teach everyone is come infront of to teach.
Sir you talking about The great savitri bai phule she fight for girl education but now in same city pune girls want equality in wrong thinks done by mens like drinking smoking. Is this savitribai want ? Is this feminizam?"
"Problem is not with feminism. Problem starts when women and men starts using feminism as an excuse to be unruly and then show that as an example to be followed. Like examples of women(feminists) who sell their bodies and then use feminism to promote the same among other young women. Similarly with multiple sxual partners both for men and women.

 I think patriarchy is still needed in a lot of aspects, for example, a child needs his/her father while growing up. A mother cannot fullfill the requirements of a father and it's a fact."

RATAN TATA IS A PURE ALPHA MAN..
you are right about feminism but the truth is many women who call them selves feminist don't fight  for those rights. if they want equal tights i don't or most men don't have a problem with that but the media only shoes us how feminist people want to wear clothes like boys or walk on the street without a shirt which is not acceptable in all societies. so people now have a mindset that feminism means girls doing bad things. i am a muslim but i am not telling you to not go to school or do a job but i am telling you to wear decent clothes which cover your body i am telling you tot not wear clothes that will attract boys towards you. i am a boy so i know what a bow will think about some one wearing those kind of clothes. again all boys aren't like that a half or 75% of them are. in most religions they show women as a sign of respect and beauty. the people who think islam doesnt alow women rights that is compleatly wrong because islam says what ever you do wear decent clothes(islam tels you to wear hijab or burkha but every one has there belifes) the people who promote that women need to be in there houses and dont need to studdy they are just pro muslims or any pro religious people. you will never here that a muslim women who wears a burkha got raped here i am not saying that if you are not muslim and dod not wear a burkha you will get raped the point i am trying to make is people who are willing to rape people are not getting attracted by women who are wearing burkha because it hides their body shape. if women wear decent enough clothes which cover their bodies than peoples minds will change and they will also support feminism. also we see in movies that a girl is drinking or smokig and they shoe those seans as feminist. but the people who associate feminism whith doing what ever a boy does will always be bs people. men and omen are two different genders they have different roles in society like men are stronger than women there is no denying that ia the same way women are better at arts  and crafts so if a women were to participate in a lifting comp with boys they will never win. just like boys will never win in arts and crafts. some people will bring out an arguement that bes painters or artists were men but we have to think that women did not have rights do improve their skills. also most big artists were feminists. so my point is women should fight for the rights they really need they should not fight for a right which they can't do good use of. this video was very informative and realistic so thank you Dhruv Rathee a lot of love for you.

"Don't Judge Humankind by it's cover!   Humans should strive to live together in harmony, embracing diversity, empathy, and mutual respect. By fostering a culture of understanding and cooperation, we can create communities where everyone's rights and dignity are upheld. Communication, compassion, and collaboration should be the pillars of our interactions, leading to a world where kindness prevails, conflicts are resolved peacefully, and each individual can flourish in a supportive environment."
The world now is no way patriarchial...it's quite balanced but those uneducated feminists disrupt the attitude of good people...if we are equal to women...why don't we have equal laws and regulations...the uneducated feminists who don't know the real meaning of feminists want to make the society matriarchial they believe they do not want any men in the society...and a lot many things...but the thing is that we all want the world to be equal to all of us ...the grass should be equally green on both the sides...I am a feminist...but an educated one...I want the world to be equal for all sections of the society тЭд

"""Either you are feminist or stupid""- This is the whole essence of your video. Perhaps a hurried, oversimplified and potentially inaccurate assumption. Equality and respect for human not any ""ideology""."
"Dear Dhruva Rathee, I want to bring your notice (or already you know) that a new type of mindset prevailed amongst male nowadays. They don't feel ashamed of having a less paid job  than a wife  or not having a job. Instead they are happy to get married to the girl with a salary or a high salary or richer. But one thing is unchanged that this type of man wants that things should go in or outside of the house according to their wishes only. This is the worst phase of a woman's condition. whomever one should bring up with humanity."

"The problem is that when people like you, sucharita and all pseudo feminist rant for straight 15-20 min in their videos tweet against such films( Kabir Singh ) or acts. But when acts that doesn't support their narrative like you have shown four more shots or the incident where the girl was slapping the auto driver, they don't even acknowledge such incidents and even if they do they don't rant. Jokingly saying ha buri film thi ya ye thodi hota he feminist ye kehke nikal jate hein. Where is your rant your tweets your 15-20 min videos about this incidents."
The wife who breaks the house due to the influence of outsiders is called a feminist.

the root cause for the arise of feminism is the basic rights which are being denied ...like right to education..right to work...and right to choice to spends their own life...even ryt to property....many asian girls do lack these ....and then on the same page due to society these bad laws like alimoney after divorce etc have been there...support equal ryts for girls and get rid of bad laws which are burden for men....i would say a true feminist wont even like to accept anything which demeans her value....nature has built man and women a bit different to sustain ecosystem and not to demean one against another...its the society which suppresses women in the name of nature...any enlightened men or women or a  thoughtful person can never imagine suppression of ryts in name of gender

"Ah, a very controversial topic cuz ismein logon ke uppar atti bandhi hai ke dusri side ki sunna gi nahi hai. I won't lie, mein bhi waisa hi tha but I do watch your videos with an open mind toh kaafi cheezon mein I was like, nahi this makes sense I was wrong. 

Now kuch cheezein hai jaise you said patriarchy ka meaning and you mentioned ke going against patriarchy isn't male bashing, but the point is ke us word ko maana wahi jaata hai, kuch gine chune human rights activists hain jo jaante hain but majority audience thinks ke patriarchy ke against jaana means you don't want men despite that fact ke even of they're capable. 

Another point is ke now I like the fact that you've touched upon mens lonliness but I wish you spoke on the unjust right that women have against men. Like if she files a complaint of harrassment or ra*e, then man will be immediately arrested without evidence or search, many women use this as a weapon against men to blackmail them, me being a victim. The fact that women marry men, file a divorce with false allegations leaving the guy in spot where he must pay a lumpsum of his income monthly or face jail time. 

Now my point here is, of course I want laws against ra*e ofcourse I want laws against abuse in a marriage and such serious issues, but I don't want it to be this absurd where women use these rights as a weapon. 

My personal view is that tier 1 cities know the rights women have and there women and men live equally, have equal incomes, I feel feminism was made to uplift the women who are deprived off their rights. Those are the families in the lower class section in our societies, the tier 2 city tier 3 city families where the old mindset still functions. But I feel in this movement whole there are few that focus on them, we've lost the meaning of feminism as privileged women use it as an excuse for their Inabilities. Where they have all rights but since they are incapable of doing something the blame it ke they don't have rights. 

As a guy I am uncomfortable getting in a relationship or talking to other women now cuz I've seen my girlfriend abuse her rights against me, due to that I might not even end up marrying anyone and just die a loner cuz I don't a bad women in my life as it'll have repercussions on my families safety."
"Why are women asking for equal rights to men ? Why don't they ask for their own rights ? Like why they don't demand higher salary rather than demanding equal salary to men ?
Female models are paid more than male models because salary is paid on the basis of the impact which they create."
Feminism is cause for mass suicide and mental illness in men. Feminism is fast disappearing in west and so will in India.. itтАЩs a rotten mindset
Men are more persecuted.

"This video is a little shallow on many topics. The things heтАЩs saying now is what I used to think in my 12th. Now after 5 years my thoughts have matured a lot thatтАЩs why I think there are more points here on each topic that can be added here. Also IтАЩm more than half way through the video and thereтАЩs nothing about toxic feminism yet. ItтАЩs all about men. Which are valid points but I think these are sensitive topics and should not be portrayed partially. ( Dhruv feels a little partial towards females, which IтАЩm not saying is a bad thing. But here he needs to be neutral) Anyways for me this video has nothing new to offer. Maybe I have outgrown from his audience. Am I the only one who feels like this?"

"this comes from the basic biological term femininity and masculinity. This is why during the prehistoric era, a man always went hunting, and females stayed in the house. This continues till date and females will date a man only if he a higher value than him/her. this is because they naturally seek protection and safety and want a good man to continue on her genes.

"Now that I think about it....the last time my best friend cried was in our childhood...he cried because he did not get admission to his desired school with a very good score, but his friend got admitted even when he had 30 points lower than my friend because he was SC/ST category. I consoled him that day. But since we have grown up, I've never seen him cry again. And I know the reason why....his friends off course!! It's a matter of shame in their friends circle if you cry.

Another incident of my school:- I was passing by a group of senior boys in the playground who were practising shotput. When a boy threw a shot, another boy commented, ""Kya bhai ladkiyon jaisa fenk rha hai!"" Which made that boy embarrassed....
That comment offended that boy & me at the same time. I felt like I wish I hadn't listened because now that comment will forever stay in my mind rent-free.
Such things definitely should be the reason for ""Smash Patriarchy"".
It does no good to men & women both."

"Ok at first I w was thinking he's gonna be impartial in his view but clearly he isn't. Yes many of the feminist didn't support Neha dhupia or that Zomato girl that's because of they did their image would be applied. Women also only pick on films where the women is abused. It's the same thing both ways. But you cannot argue the fact that women get maternity leave but men don't?. Women can slap but men can't?. Women have reservations men don't?. Yessir I will.acceptball these things if u give men the right to do with women what they would do with men. But no. In the name of equality women get special treatment and men are discriminated against. This man spoke only of the negative effects of patriarchy. Lmao dude till this day let's assume it was a patriarchy what happened?. So many kingdoms were conquered in a patriarchy, all these developments happened due to patriarchy. The roads u travel on was built by a man. Give women that job they'll likely effin drop dead. Just watch bear Grylls video where he left women and men seperately on an island. The women began to cry for the men. That's why the man is always above the woman. I don't say women are useless. Without them something called home is incomplete. Dhruv also missed the fact that women consider working at home and taking care of children as inferior to what men are doing. This is a mindset problem not that of who's on top. When men are running most of the country there should be some rights for them that women shouldn't have. But that doesn't make them inferior. You get your motherly privilage don't u. Also he is bashing the boys on Instagram for no reason. They post reels on how men ignore Distraction to focus on their goals or how they don't care if it's a woman who's bothering them. This statement is only understood by men but whenever a female calls you for help you get 10x stronger for no reason. And as for the loneliness and no crying thing  that actually makes us feel like we have conquered something once the dust has settled. So what is my final point? Well women have a mindset issue and are trying to change something that was in place for centuries and expect a smooth transition which isn't. Let me give u an example. There are 2 men a strong one and a smart one. The strong one lays the bricks for the building while the smart one plans the building. Women asking for rights is like the smart one asking to lay bricks. Even if he got it he wouldn't be useful and would be a waste of energy. He was built to be smart not strong. Similarly if the strong one was making the plans it wouldn't go great either. I respected dhruv in most of his videos but this was a let down. He missed all key points of the struggle. He thinks women are righteous and fight only for equal rights but in fact it's quite the opposite. U all know of nirbhaya case where 4men r@ped and killed a woman and we're executed but there's another case called Shabnam Ali case where a women killed 7 of her family members but was given just life in prison?. How is this equality?. So ur telling me life of 1 women is more important than that of 7 (including old men and children). This is the era we live in. Men stay strong we were built to Maintain law and order. Crush any resistance you face be it friend or foe. Feel free to reply this is one of the domains I have to dominate"

"Wonderful video. Explained it very well with examples. However as expected from Dhruv, there is not even single mention of muslim community which is far behind in women rights compared to any other community. Garud puran bhi aya, Hindu culture bhi aya, france bhi aya, male issues bhi agaye which is Wonderful but somehow i knew in the beginning itself that Druv is going to mention Hinduism and Hindu culture but won't mention the religion or culture where feminism is need of the hour."

"Nature made Men and Women differently and gave them different field of expertise if a doctor tries to be engineer he might gain some success but in the long run he will fail. Same as a woman tries to do the jobs that should men do they will suffer from lot of responsibility. Men are the protector women. A Father's responsibility is to protect his daughter, A husband responsibility is  to protect his wife. Women has also responsibility towards Men. A woman is the power of a men. A son can be successful by the help of his mother. A husband gets mental support from his wife. In my opinion men and women should equally get education but in job sector if a woman tries to do the jobs of a man she has to become a woman and a man at the same time that's unfair for a woman. A man should give financial support to a family and a woman should give practical presence in the family but in running the house both man and woman should be a companion to each other. A man should not dictate the house. If you want to match to puzzles together if have to put them correctly not to cut them and make them equal and then try to put them together. That's not how it works ЁЯШФ"

"The word should have been something like ""Equalist ,Equagenderist, Genderightist"". Why did they name it as Feminist. I feel like there's a big problem in that term itself. The word itself gives the feeling that it prioritizes female more than male instead of equality between two genders. It may sound kinda stupid but I am just sharing how I feel about that term specifically.

By the way, I want to hear your opinion on the Population declination problem in the developed countries, where I believe that one of the main causes is the idea of Independent woman(who can live without having a man as her life partner).  Hope, this comment reaches you."

That's really so important to explain to men that if women are allowed to be independent and have a good life equal rights and feel safe will help men too....some of thier burdens will be shared and they won't have to keep everything inside.....this was the first point after getting a job and falling in love I realized that my love for him even in his struggling days was not about gifts and money spent by him by memories and what we can do together and money not involved from his side made our relationship more selfless and it made me feel less obliged and more loving towards him....coz somewhere I knew in my heart my love was just for his personality and traits that will never go unlike momey

"There were many evils in India before independence.  Some of these evils are:

 polygamy

 Purdah system

 tradition of Sati

 Ban on widow remarriage

 no education for girls

 female foeticide

 child marriage

 Caste System

 Ban on women's education and widow remarriage

 Disrespectful behavior towards widows

 communalism

 dowry system

 To remove these evils, social reformers launched movements from time to time.  After independence, now these evils are negligible.  However, many evils are still seen in India.



 Many thanks to all those great men and great women who tried to stop these evils.

"First time IтАЩm seeing one of your videos and didnтАЩt learn anything useful. Feminism was to bring equality, but at this point I see Men being the disadvantaged sex."
"The problem is not feminism. The problem is that instead of educated intellectuals representing feminism, we've made narcissistic celebrities the face of it and they've exploited the concept for their own gain. 4 more shots please is more talked about than Kaplana Chawla. 
The other ugly side of it is our appeasement politics which has resulted in a legal system that leads to exploitation of men. In a corrupt nation, a new law is just a new excuse for the system to rob you of your resources."

Finally someone whom we can trust because I have never seen any video in his channel degrading women
I always knew what is true feminism but just like we evolve as a human being feminist also evolved themselves..now it is not about equality if it was there was not more than 75% of men getting accused of false rape cases ...no one in feminism and feminist is wanting govt to change the laws into gender neutral laws .... men's are doing suicide because of this ...our laws are made to make men suffer ..there should be consequences if a women falsely accused someone of rape voilence and dowry...

"A great work of research. You have presented this issue so clearly and perfectly but I would like to diagree with your point on men's depression issue. I think the society has been like this since very old times that men have to face what comes ahead of them without ranting what they feel about it in front of their family members so as to not worry them and not make them feel like the head of the family ( not referring patriarchy here) himself is breaking apart and hence they feel weak in exchange. And also due to this expeessing feelings thing, men's suicidal rate has increased because of obviously the patriarchal thinking of the women that this man is weak and all. It was not like this in old times."

"stress created by patriarchal society also results in decreased fertility in men.. but a feminist society also tries to put stress on a man to become something else.. The problem with humans is that they try to mold everything according to their understanding rather than their observations.. Feminist men try to mold men into something else, which can cause stress again, which would result in decreased fertility... what we need is meditation... one solution for all problems...

feminism is bad for our society but the more dangerous thng is dhruv rathee who is connected to anti-national (terrorist) organisations. Please stop mr rathee. If you want to tell your political views tell the truth about your philosophy about AAP. you are a it cell of aap. you told that vedas are lies. but the most biggest lier is you mr rathee. I appeal to all subscribers to not watch those who tell half truth.
"According to my personal opinion, people generally consider equality and similarity to be one and the same thing although it is not. However, I think God has created both men and women equal although not similar. They have some similarities and some differences."

It explores how both men and women suffer under patriarchal expectations, and showcases real feminist heroes who fought for equality for all. Join the call to create a world where everyone can be their true selves, free from outdated norms and expectations."
Brilliant..thank you for this.

"Dhruv i generally support your videos but here you just showed a good side of mirror i believe in mindset treat humans as humans irrespective of gender but unfortunately laws doesnt seems to like this idea we critise feminism not as an idea it should be implemented but not at cost of nerfing men unecessarily 
I know you would never discuss cases like sarvjeet singh bedi or many other fake cases of rape ,dowry,violence which meant to protect women but is now only harming man mostly due to these laws taking woman as victim not being gender neutral but you havent discussed as it doesnt fit your narrative
 today a man is defamed and arrested and not just accqused treated as criminal until proven innocent in criminal case against women, even kerala HC admitted this mistake 
even in civil cases if a man cheats in marriage he has to pay alimony after divorce fair,if a woman cheats in marraige man has to still pay alimony after divorce she gets custody and in order to be safe she files multiple case on innocent husband like marital rape and dowry which leads him to sentence even if he has not done anything because it is way too hard to prove innocent  

even the recent uttarakhand ucc law has live in relationship regulation act but in it only male partner has to alimony if he broke up but if girls dump then there is no such provision there are very less gender neutral laws aur laws to protect men rights 

if you read this comment have gut to reply and deep think on it dont just bend a narrative to push an idea although feminism is important but we should not create a generation of oppressive men rights to push it it should give equal scale by being gender neutral and not being gender bias"

"24.00  girl slapping was not the feminism that people were calling out , no one was there to help that guy even the police was not there to help him out because the unfair rights and law are made for women , which made other people not to stop that girl and even police not to detaint her,....
 Clearly she was loudy saying the stuffs like ""ek ladki ko touch karega tu, ek ladki ko tu touch nahi kar sakta hai , "" to the guy who was actually there to stop the girl"
You are right I am not against this but then woman get more education reservations then man

"Problem here is there less of feminist who actually do anything for female rights, and more of the women like neha dhupia who entitle themselves as feminist and makes stupid a claims and argument , problem here is since they are pop culture it's most likely they anyone who is not aware will draw his idea of feminism from them instead of following real feminist"

"Hi Dhruv! I am one of your fans! Love most of your videos. Been watching you for more than 2 yrs. This will be my 1st comment. 
Its a logical fallacy when you say, men and women should be paid equal. They should be paid based on their work, removing the gender from question. Female only drives which are labelled as feminist are actually matriarchy (well most of the times it's just a gimmick to woo some employees). World has seen many times that quota beyond a point actually does bad, than good. Kalpana Chawla shouldn't be labelled here as a woman astronaut, rather than a intellectual top brain astronaut. The day we stop speaking of sympathizing women in particular (sympathize the weak not any particular gender),  is when they will get true equality. Otherwise, it might turn from a patriarchy society to a matriarchy one as well."

"Feminism can be good if done right. If not, ya messed up. Badly.

With that being said though, feminism is a movement that started out with good intentions, but its messaging has been so distorted that people are misunderstanding what it actually is, which is, fundamentally, equality of the sexes.

I call it the 'movement of Theseus', akin to the ship of Theseus paradox, basically how much of a well-intentioned movement can be changed, distorted and torn apart until it's no longer what it started out as.

Edit: shows such as Four More Shots aren't feminism. It's buzzwordy, pop feminism that doesn't actually do anything."

Hi
Lots of comments on ANIMAL movie review -> Saw the comments and other videos to manipulate the next video for making viral -> Concluded FEMINISM for the upcoming -> Prepared the video on FEMINISM.
"Let's be honest. Every construct has its own advantages and disadvantages, Feminism included. Not everyone is going to honor it's true values and it's already happening. Hate towards men, ignoring men's issues, excluding trans and gender non conforming from feminist discussions. It's all there if you look at it closely and you need to give an unbiased opinion of it. Which was lacking in this video."

In short we should promote feminism but not toxic feminism.
Man and women are not equal
"At 17:13 you mentioned Cassie Jaye, which is very disingenuous of you. She made a documentary called ""The Red Pill"", which highlights how men's rights are often subject to censorship and dismissal by feminist organizations. She stopped identifying as a feminist after making the documentary as her own documentary was censored by feminists and she received nasty messages from feminists. Equality between men and women would mean that men get all the privileges that women get, which is not something that feminists have ever fought for. As for ""real feminism"" vs. ""fake feminism"" - there is no such thing. Feminism is everything that its used for."

"Dear brother I completely agree with your video.  Whatever you said is true but actually women understand the meaning of feminist as matriarchy, a concept not only women but our government also do this, now they have come out a rule that if a boy is in a relationship with a girl and a boy said I will marry you but there were some reasons due to which he could not marry her, he could have been jailed for 10 years, whereas if the girl in front of him had done the same thing then she would not have been punished or fined.  Would this be feminism (equality)?  While I have nothing to do with this rule because I am single and only a boy, if I were in a relationship then this would have happened to me too, I have just talked about a rule, I don't know how many other such bad and useless rules are there.  Nowadays feminism in India means matriarchy."

I agree with the patriarchal topic you have discussed but again you also should talk about the latter side"
You have a little misstake.  There is a need of gender equity not equality..  these two word sounds like same. I've done a course on gender education in my B.Ed study. I've read and research on this.   There are  lot of differences in this two words.  Hope you get it.
"The process of evolution is bit too sliw in certain issues like these. We, almost all, love at heart whatever we inherit and truthfully speaking we can't instantly change our mindsets as compared to changing our material possession. Human behaviour is very much intetesting subject but very much ignored.  As such no governments would ever work for such issues. They would leave these things to be solved automatically or on its own.  However, your effort to clarify the  matter is absolutely praiseworthy and eye opening. You seem to be blessed with extraordinary mindset to promote education and peace among people. Hats off to you."

Islam provides women safety. They don't have to work bcoz girls are the responsibility of her father before marriage and after marriage it's the responsibility of men whom she married. Women aren't equal to men. They have to obey them. But it's not mean this that they don't get their actual rights. In Islam a women is a responsibility of men whom she marries.

"I still believe in Patriarchy. 
Even if feminism win over patriarchy for once. Patriarchy will again bounce back. Because deep down a woman also admire a patriarchal man. She also wants a man who can lead her. No women wants an emotionally weak men as her partner. 
If you can't hide your emotions your tears then you're not strong enough, whether you're man or woman. These are only the excuses like men have emotions too, men can also cry... to make men weak and to shake the very foundation of patriarchy. I know men have emotions, they cry too. But they should not show their emotions or cry in front of others. Because it not only shows them weak but people also lose interest in them. 

Be a man. Follow patriarchy. It will make you strong. It is harsh for both man as well as woman but remember this harshness is necessary. You can't blame patriarchy for your weaknesses. 

It is okay to expel out the practices like child marriages, sati practice, etc. It is okay to bring equality in terms of education, job, employment, etc. But it is not okay to provide women free seats, free travel services, free ka attention, special treatment just because they are women. If they're equal then why are you giving special privileges to them. Treat them equally.

I want only the pure essence of Patriarchy of producing tough, masculine, hard working, strong, charismatic and leader like men to be preserved.

And this guy Dhruv Rathee is s content creator at the end. He will only focus on the side of what his subscribers want to see. (Left wala left ki taraf bias hota hai. Right wala right ki taraf. This is how they can maintain the traffic over their Channel.)

"In olden days in Kerala there was a system called ""Marumakkathayam"" means men marrying a lady and start staying in lady's house, means just opposite to what we see today.

You said what's the real feminism is 
Now tell the real truth about patriarchy.
We all should give the right what women deserves. 
You should also talk about the mentality of men and women.
Men and women doesnтАЩt think in the sameway.The nature of men and women are not same.God has created men in such a way that they can handle the external environment.

"Hamen wo system apnana chahiye, jo well tried system hai.

Bharat men well tried system hai, Patriarchal.

Yah several thousand years tak successful raha hai.

Feminisim ko introduce karne ki koshish karengen, to hazaron mushkilen aayengi.

Ant men collision hoga.

Jo aaj ho raha hai.

Purush ko nature ne very strong banaya hai femal ke mukable.

Jab dono men than jayengi, to striyon ka large scale men killing hoga.

Isliye, Bharat men mardon ko extra power milna chahiye apni patni ko control karne ka."
Women should respect men too. If a so-called faminist dominates the patriarchy then this is called misogynistic not faminist.

"Equality doesnt simply means distribution of equal rights but it means to give equal oppurtunities on the basis of ability by removing disparities from the society.
Men and women are not identical, but they should be treated with equal value and respect. Defining ""equal"" can be complex, and it's important to consider different aspects of life when discussing this issue. Understanding the diversity and complexities within each gender group is crucial for a truly nuanced and accurate perspective. One should also consider Overgeneralization Dangers, Emotional Expression, Cognitive Strengths, Communication Styles, also  Evolutionary Theories, Hormonal Influences, Brain Structure to fully understand the differences in order to provide justice to both men and women.

Liberty cannot be divorced from equality; equality cannot be divorced from liberty, nor can liberty and equality be divorced from fraternity. Dr B R Ambedkar"

"""If I may? I would like to post an interesting question.""
Are Humans beings truly equal?
These days everywhere you go there's a talk about fighting for equality..
As a wise man once said, ""Heaven does not create one person above or below another.""
People like to throw his words around, but that's not the whole quote; he goes on to say
That while we are all born equal at birth pretty soon things begin to change.
Academic effort is what sets people apart to rise above the others. At any rate, ....
Humans change over time based on their actions. Truth be told at the end of the day,
""Equality, is just a fantasy And most of us go through life denying the fact that we live in a meritocracy.""
So , do your best; the perfect equality among all beings whether ideological or practical may not subsists but you may still achieve bits of it ' given that you have what it takes to make it possible."
"Thank you for giving me a new insight on the femenist issue alot of the the Men right movement focus on the same men rights. and bringing change to the female mind of hypergamy that results from piatriarchy seems like an impossible goal, so then y move away from traditional safety when falling into traditional roles appear safer than any other way of life at this moment."

"Although, I agree to a lot of your views shared on several other topics, I disagree to your talking points in this video.
To start with, Feminism is a women's advocacy movement and feminists are mainly at loggerheads with men's rights movements. You see this clearly in the USA, where most of the tenants of this ideology were formed. 
Feminists would not pursue anything that goes against the detriment of women's rights, benefits, advantages already enjoyed in a patriarchal society e.g. men paying on dates, free entries to women in clubs, etc.. The advocacy and female hyper-gamy have gone beyond control to such an extent in the West that it has become increasingly hard for men to date women, as it clearly creates a bias. The rise in female sex workers and Onlyfans models is to a large extent a product of Feminism."

"We Hindus should not be influenced by Stupid Western Ideas. 

In Hinduism women and men are not equal. They both have their own roles in Society. People like Dhruv Rathee are manipulating and brainwashing Indian Teenagers to blindly mimic Western Civilization Ideas, 

And the result is India too will become a Lawless, Dystopian, Dysfunctional Society like America or Britain, Inheriting their Problems like Wokes, Leftists, Crime, Shooting and High Divorce rates and Single Parents. Do you want this nonsense in India ? Hell no.

Think of every Nation and Civilization as Unqiue, India should follow its own Definition of Feminism, Human RIghts etc based on our Culture and Religious values. Why ? Because not all shoe sizes fit everyone. We are aell different. A Woman can never be a Man, In HIndu Culture we worship Durga, Great Goddess. We don't need lessons of respecting women from Western Culture whose books tell to enslave female captives of war."

"The idea of feminism is just to promote equality amongst genders and ensure that everyone, regardless of their gender, has the same rights, opportunities, and respect. It's about breaking down societal norms and stereotypes that limit individuals based on their gender, and striving for a world where everyone is treated fairly and with dignity. Feminism isn't about hating men or putting one gender above another; it's about creating a more inclusive and just society for all."

In socialmedia most of the men which are educated they also don't know the real mean of what feminism is but in the term of truth there are also dark side and negative effect of both side feminism or patriarchy concepts most of the people by using the name of feminism miss gide the females so then some of the females starts to disintegrate mans. By my own opinion both feminism and patriarchycal mind sets are acceptable but in limits and without knowing the real defination of these cocepts the people on the social media shouldn't miss guide the people by the of alfa male or gender equality

So breathe ЁЯзШтАНтЩВя╕П deeply and push gently - play instead of foreplay - by massaging the breast simultaneously while pushing into pussy with application of seed pressed oil like ЁЯСН mustard or olive ЁЯлТ oils; massaging of breast squeezes out old blood ЁЯй╕ and secretions allowing fresh blood ЁЯй╕ to come in to nourish the breast tissues thus preventing inflammatory lumps and cancer!

Also, men release the three preparatory secretions Viz. Prostatic, CowperтАЩs and Seminal Vesicles before SPERM, the 4th secretion! Better to stop before SPERM release, the 4th secretion because it is too expensive for the body with growing age!

This Posture allows massaging of Clitoris from outside (glans of Clitoris) and inside (the root of Clitoris called G-Spot)

Dhruv put on toxic feminism in thumbnail but didnтАЩt talk enough abt the uprising toxic feminism in the world which is concerning
Maturity is when u realise man and woman aren't equal.... dhruv Rathi I am always ur one of the biggest supporter....but India is not as simple as u think....I repeat man and woman aren't equal.... Indian log dharti ko mata bhi mante hain aur pair jute kahi achhi chizo pe lag jaye to bhagwan se maafi bhi mangte hai ...u Just can't ignore importance of both .....but it is not equal at all. I hope u got my point.
"Going out and chasing career is equal rights?

Great video.! Can someone tell me the background music piano used from 2:55-3:30
Sir imran khan ki come back par video banao
"Long text warning!! But please read if you have time, it's just my opinion/observation (No hate):

what you defined in feminism, is perfectly fine in theory.
feminism is all about equal rights for all men & women. I do understand that. and I believe, almost everyone who use internet in a mindful way knows the real meaning of feminism. So, men aren't hating feminism because they don't know what feminism is. It's because there's a difference between theory & practical. 

Let's understand it in this way,
in school/college when we study topics related to physics & stuffs, we are 1st taught the theory behind that topic. In the theory everything is perfect, everything is beautiful, everything just works flawlessly because there's not many complications (we assume/neglect lots of things for simplicity's sake). 
But then we are sent to perform the same thing in a practical lab, then we observe that whatever we've learnt in theory is not completely matching with how things work in reality. Because reality doesn't work with our assumptions/we can't just neglect any parameter as our wish. With that we always come to the conclusion that, it's ok to assume things in theory for simplicities sake but you can't just neglect the randomness of reality, because reality is what matters the most.

Now, where am I going with this one? Well, the definition of feminism/the massage that it portrays is great as long as you're just saying it, like in theory.
But, do we really see the practical implementation of feminism in our society? Do we really see people use feminism with gender neutrality? NO!!!!
Whenever women do something stupid, majority of the time(what I've observed), then they start playing the ""w"" card in the name of feminism, that they have all right to do anything/wear anything/it's her choice/none can give her even an advice(not even father or husband), because they say men are controlling them & they are free/will do anything they want. Why? Because they are true feminists(they say). They believe in women empowerment & all. I have never seen any guy do unethical things in the name of feminism, if fact men don't even use feminism even when they themself are suffering. 

I'm not talking about those movies that you've mentioned. It's happening in real life. And this number is a lot, A LOT!!!!!! And increasing!
If in practical/reality these feminists believe so much in equality, then where were they when women were charging men for false rape cases & the men went to jail. And after a long time, the rape case was proved false, and the man's life/career is destroyed. But still, nothing happened to the women. Why no feminist talked/even cared about it. Even I've read comments of girls saying, ""whatever happened it was perfect, men need to suffer, because men also rapes women"" (that's their logic)!

Where were your feminism, when women were openly abusing/slapping men (even in house)? And the men can't do anything because he knows that if he does something, the public would beat the living hell out of him & those so-called feminists are abusing their ""feminist""/""women"" card for these reasons. And at the end, nothing happens to the women, people give the man sympathy by saying, ""she's a women, what can we do after all."". everyone acts as if it's no big deal. But if the gender were reversed, then it would be a huge HUGE issue. everyone will blame the man so hard & he will go to jail for assaulting. And also, she can file a rape case on him as a bonus!!!

See, pretty easy to describe feminism but reality is much complex. Not saying you should hate feminism. but instead of feminism, we should follow equalism/rights for all souls on earth. I know feminism does the exact same thing. But it is being misused so much in society (specially women abuse it so much) because, feminism has the word, ""feminine"" in it.
I think we should promote equalism more than anything.
Anyways loved the video though"
"aaj the videos are not that interesting dhruv, make some videos related to history more interesting"
Do you believe in LGBTQ?
"thanks to feminism in the last 80 years we have the most naked, nude, porn-producing women today than ever in human history.  I look forward to a day when Dhruv's daughter will have the right to choose to create multiple-category porn and spread in the near future.  Who needs traditional tested moral values and roles, the future is bright and more hedonistic.  If you find this offensive then you are mentally ill and backward.  GET with the PROGRAM - you have not been woke, socially conditioned, and brainwashed yet."

WE SHOULD REPLACE THE TERM FROM FEMINISM TO EQUALISM AS IT WILL CAUSE LESS CONFLITS AND MORE PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND IT EASILY.
I totally agree with you but men get high paid because they work more than women & majority of women who believe in equality they always prefer rich guy over a struggler  & there is no patriarchal mindset on such women because most of them are feminist
"okay if there should be equall rights can a man slaps back a woman if she slaps a man, or use abusive language or try take advantages of being a woman should a man response back equally ?"
"You should have to give a solution in the end of the video for degrading patriarchy in our society like Spreading Awareness about what Feminism stands for , how patriarchal mindset doesn't allow to develop for whatever group (like - family, Society etc) and make a period for this topic in school to have discussions about so that future generations could understands the values and virtues that a girl carries . Thankyou sir..... What a explanation тЭд"
"Amazing video, so informative and very well explained."
Great content as always. The problem with so-called feminist these days don't know the difference between feminism and ego towards man.
"And this same issue continues to our laws where Rape can only happen to a woman and not a man, woman can file a fake dowry, domestic violence case and other cases and thereтАЩs no way a man can legally get out of these cases. 
After divorce, Only a man has to maintain the woman her whole life irrespective of if he earns or not. 
The court told a man that do what ever you have to do, steal, take a loan or earn, but maintain your wife or youтАЩll be jailed."

"Can you please stop the bookish definition, and get into the real world? I consider myself logical and rational, but i am not a feminist. Which equal right does a woman not have which a man have? But there are literally laws and rights that are anti men. There is no gender based wage gap, if it exsisted, and employers were able to get away with that, no one will ever hire men. Feminists fighting for men's rights? ЁЯШВЁЯШВЁЯШВЁЯШВ.. thats so laughable.  You said patriarchial women are forced to do household, ok, then please give an answer on how come if the most higher earning women, wants a man earning more than her. And there are have been research papers that have stated that since most average women are not physically strong compared to most average men, then try manipulation and shaming tactic. The numbers of s*****de  is more in men than in women, and the most prominent reason is not patriarchial mindset, its woman. Right to vote is US was only given to men, cause men went to wars. In India, women can divorce men for the pettist of reasons, but for men to get divorce, it is uphill battle. I literally disgust cheaters, regardless of genders. Kisi feminist ne nahi kaha ki Neha Dhupia ne jo kaha so sahi tha, but kisine unhe criticise bi nahi kiya. Kisi feminists ne support nahi dikhaya, but criticise b nahi kiya."

It is the social, religion and jurisdictional punishment fear which makes people to behave good on this planet, More liberty could only create chaos in every corner of the world."

"@Dhruv, first of all, thanks for making video on such a complicated topic. Your presentation is mind blowing as always. But I think you have oversimplified some things and I want your opinion on some of the things that you missed.

1) You mentioned that the women who believe in patriarchy do so bcz of normative confomity. That is - they only do so bcz of societal norms. But is it totally true? Isn't patriarchy also very ""convenient "" for girls? As mentioned in the movie Barbie, due to patriarchy, women don't have to take hard decisions, they don't have to face harsh conditions that men are trained to embrace. Don't you think many women like this? Which brings me to the next point 

2) If we are talking about ""equal"" rights- sure, I'm up for it. But I want equality in every front. Not just for the powerful or gainful situations. I want equal number of females soldiers fighting equally at the forefronts of wars for all countries. I want equal number of women in hardworking jobs like plumbing, construction work, sewage cleaning, moving and packing services etc. Is everyone up for it? 

3) Why should the very term that speaks about ""equality"" start with ""females""? I understand the historical point of view but since we are trying to change the society, should not we choose a term that sounds more gender neutral?

4) You compared males and females as 75% same in terms of physiological norms. Being a PhD in Molecular Biology, let me tell you that Males and Females are different in terms of chromosome (XY vs XX) that is the very beginning of life. And there are many other differences physiologically such as bone density, muscular structure, hormonal composition etc. that you oversimplified. Men and women are complementary to each other. Although, I think overall your presentation agrees with this concept but still the representation is slightly misleading. 

My overall take is - we should believe in ""equity"" of rights rather than ""equality"" of rights. ""Equality"" is a very oversimplified, vague term that creates confusion. ""Equity"" refers to giving everyone same opportunities whereas ""equality"" refers to giving everyone same outcome. They sound similar but are very different. Stay well and keep making good videos."

"The main problem is people don't differentiate between toxic feminism and feminism. The current generation mostly support toxic feminism such as ' we don't need men, we can do whatever we want'. You will find many feminists (general people)  who say I'm feminist but then objectify men and want all the perks. Mostly they focus on bringing down men by uplifting female when it should be equal. Hence people start to believe toxic feminism = feminism. 

Another problem is feminists come forward to discredit films like animal but do they show that much aggression when  they say 'four more shots is toxic?' Some even don't talk at all."

"The Hindu Code Bill refers to a series of laws aimed at reforming Hindu personal law in India. It was a significant legislative effort initiated by the Indian government to bring about social reform and gender equality within Hindu society. The Hindu Code Bill sought to address issues such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and adoption among Hindus, which were previously governed by traditional customs and religious practices that often discriminated against women.

The bill was primarily championed by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and other social reformers. However, it faced strong opposition from conservative elements within Hindu society. Despite this opposition, the Hindu Code Bill was eventually passed in various iterations between 1955 and 1956, marking a significant step forward in the quest for gender equality and social justice in India.


Dr. B.R. Ambedkar he, was a strong advocate for women's rights. He believed in gender equality and fought against discrimination based on gender. Ambedkar emphasized the importance of education for women and their participation in the workforce. He was instrumental in drafting laws that aimed to improve the status of women in Indian society, including the Hindu Code Bill, which sought to give women equal rights in matters such as marriage, inheritance, and property ownership. Ambedkar's vision for women's rights was rooted in social justice and equality for all members of society.

This bill was even for upper caste women he was a great polarized leader

"Equality is a very confusing word. Let's say I have 2 friends, one is skinny and another one foodie. If I invite both of them in a dinner and offer them an equal amount of food, that will be equal, but will not be justice. The moral of the story, who works/ contributes more, must be paid more. This civilization isn't built by just doctors, engineers, and politicians. We also need oil rig workers, brick labor, construction workers, firefighters, etc. Apply for them as well and get equality."

"I'm okay with femisum.┬а
But I would like to marry a girl who knows her family role while I earn for them.┬а
You can call me patriarchal if you want to, but I want my family to grow culturally. If both presents go out, who will take care of the child? You can see that in western countries, where people are less cultural, their families are ruined.
And why are we fighting about equal rights? Which rights are we talking about here? Man and woman both have the same rights, and in many divorce cases, women have more support from the court. And don't tell me why, in western countries where the divorce ratio is high, 95% of divorces come from women who have a college degree. (I'm not saying that women should not be educated, but it's what all statistics say.) Sorry, but if that's the case, I would like to support my culture and play my role in society. And only marry that girl who knows her role in the family and is culturally influenced to take care of my family at home.I don't care if she's educated or not. I'm not against education, but she has to know how our culture has described the role of the wife in the family.
Srimad-Bhagavatam
SB Canto 1
A wife's duty is to follow her husband 100 percent. And Gandhari was so true to her husband that she followed him even in his perpetual blindness.
SB Canto 3
It is the duty of the wife to take charge of household affairs and not compete with the husband.
There are more verses like this for both wife and husband.
We have given equal rights to women. And yes, it's necessary.┬а
But we can't give the same characteristics to both genders; it's what nature has given us.
If we don't bring back cultural ways of living and living in modernism, we will soon have a problematic future that western countries are going through.
I'm not against feminism, but I'm against cheating, sexism, and a lack of loyalty from both genders."

You are magnificent dhruvЁЯТЫ
"@Dhruv Usually your videos are quite detailed but this one felt lacking. So many claims, and barely any proof. Throughout the video I kept thinking citation needed! citation needed!!

It is true that men are not allowed to cry. But tell honestly, how often do you cry? If you cry, does your life partner see you with respect? The attraction falls steeply once the man cries, that's the bitter truth.
And why do you even believe that men need to cry. Sounds like you have started agreeing with what you hear from other feminists.
Maybe men feel naturally better by completing challenging activities.

Yes Feminists claim that men need to cry for their own mental well being. But how do we know that's the truth. Maybe that's only true for women. Biologically speaking, women have smaller tear ducts, so, if a man and a woman both are about to tear up, women's tears spill onto the cheeks fasters while men's tears stay held in the ducts.

And why is EVERYONE claiming that men are less emotionally intelligent. The truth is that men are pretty good with each other. Usually men are able to regulate their emotions better than women. That's literally the definition of being emotionally intelligent. Men don't understand women's mood swings, but that's a whole different topic.

Yes, suicide rates are indeed higher in men, but maybe because stress is increasing in general. Maybe because we are living in concrete blocks rather than natural habitates? Maybe living in isolation and without the right to exercise our physical strength has a bad impact on the mental health?? Remember 1 lakh years ago when a monkey would give you stress and you'd immediately throw a giant rock at it. Or run away. Men's problems were always solvable through physical strength for the past 1 lakh years. But not anymore. Maybe that's the core reason behind the downfall of our mental health?

Moreoever, modern feminists claim that women are oppressed. They claim that women earn less money for the same job. You hinted this in your video, ""both should be paid equally"".
If that was true, won't just businesses hire women instead of men for the same job?
The truth is that women earn more per hour for the same job than men, that's why companies prefer hiring men.
Yes, business loose money due to paid maternity leave, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. If you hire a man, you get a better yield for the same salary, because you can put more burden on the man. And moreover most MNC's that try to flaunt gender equality in their teams, often hire less qualified women to enforce the sex ratio. How is that fair? It certainly does not seem like an ""equal opportunity"" when a more qualified person was denied the job due to gender-based quotas. Same goes for entrance in IITs now a days. This is the effect of feminism movements only, right?

And why do you keep saying that men don't want women to have equal rights? When they already got equal rights.
Seriously, Where are we lacking?

If you say that in this remote village, women are not allowed in this specific temple then I'll say come on man! Focus on metro cities once. Women have more rights than men already. Any woman can put any allegation on any man and the man gets beaten up by the mob or the police. I know you want to empower those oppressed women in the villages, but what about the oppressed men in the cities? Where do we go? Any woman can file for a false dowry case, false domestic violence case, and basically extort money from the man.

Also, the BIG difference between we joking about saying this guy has another girlfriend, vs a woman having an extra boy friend, the main difference is that for a woman it is really easy to have an affair. Because men have a very low bar to find a woman attractive enough to impregnate her.  So, every woman (no matter good looking or not, no matter single or married) will always be continuously approached by some men (single or married) who find her attractive at that point of time. And she can easily have an affair and get pregnant. Whereas the equations is very different for men. A normal man (who is not among top 2% tall +charming men) has to work extremely hard to impress just one woman in his life. And if the love of his life cheats, this man is completely devastated. This is the core difference. And average woman can very easily make one boy fall in love with her, and then completely destroy him by easily having another affair, and never stop, keep going on a spree, destroying hearts. And an average man has to do a massive amount of hard work to make one woman fall in love with him. I hope it is now clear to you why we laugh at a guy with 2 gf, and frown upon a girl who has 2 bfs. It has nothing to do with patriarchal thinking, it is just basic biology. THIS IS NOT HYPOCRISY! This will only become equal when men start giving birth to kids. 

Speaking of which, you misunderstood Mrs Neena Gupta. She said that since our biologies are different, the hormones that control our emotions are so different, it is natural to observe differences in the jobs preferred by men and women. You missed that point. I hope you look back at this video once you are more matured and come to the conclusion that this video is nothing less than another propaganda."

"Talking about mens rights, you should also talk about the cases where a woman makes false allegations against a boy for a rape case, and the man loses his repuation , he is kicked out of his job and many men commit suicide.

I just have some constructive criticism for you about your  animal review , it is fine , good message, but in the past you have talked and promoted many many more violent and patriarchial movies and tv shows like gangs of wasseypur and breaking bad, money heist.

Also, those who demanded a ban on Cassie Jaye's Red Pill documentary are also modern day feminists. I love and admire feminists like Cassie Jaye and shall always support them but most of the feminits are not like her. Most modern feminists are toxic wokes who only want their side to be heard any dissent to their ideas shunned."

"I have a different opinion on this particular topic.

When we talk about any term implementation in our society we should look the conditions, situations facing societies who are adopting that particular culture.

Men and women both are equal in terms of having rights as a civilian, as a child, as a sibling, as individual human being living in any country. But at the same time when they constitute a family then they become responsible for certain things. Individually they both should have equal rights. But when it comes to form a new family then they both adopt specific designation.

Marriage is a constitution. 

When a man gets married nature demands from him to provide for his wife and child. Why?? I tell you later. But at the same time, when a woman gets married nature demands from her to make home. Be there for her child, be there for home, be there when her husband returns home tired. Be there to cook or provide healthy food via any cook or by her own. Be there to  maintain home, and more precisely for her child. Child demands mother love by nature. 

Do you remember? When we had returned from school in our old school days we always hunted ""where is mom? Where she's gone?"" Because we too wanted that mother should be there for us.

Women by nature is more into patience when it comes to bear the tantrums of children. Women are good enough in nurturing and upbringing of kids by God. Women are good in managing things precisely and keenly.

Men on the contrary, are good in leading home. They have leadership qualities. They are strong enough in case they lost their jobs, they can work hard physically to earn in any catastrophic conditions. That's why God has given them power and strong head. They could be patient but not more than a women in case of facing child tantrums. They supposingly give children time but not able to sit all day at home to nurture kids and bear their emotions. Men are not made in this way.

This all what I said above is general wordics, I'm not targeting any specific situation. 


Now imagine, how would it look like when both man and woman started doing jobs. I'm talking about average 9 to 5 job. Not above any business thingy, not talking about working hard in sites. Just an average office job or 9 to 5 any job. 

When both father and mother are absent for certain amount of time from home who would take care of child?? Grandma?? Baby sitter?? How long!? Let's suppose you both man and woman are making hell lots of money and somehow able to pay for cook(chef), home cleaner, for cleaning cloths, for baby sitter, bills, schooling of kids and what not. In this regard, you can just run the home, you can say (bachy pall rahy hain, lekin tarbiyt ni ho rahi) children lack mind relief and more into mental illness due to absence of parents counselling role in their lives, and could not get benefits from home making,eventually both will think where they'd put thereselves into. This is very hectic and busy routine.

9 to 5 is very hectic, a woman returns from work and instead of relaxing she have to take care of child what they ate? What they did whole day? What they all have to eat in dinner and at night both partners have to give time to eachother too. Man can cook, can do laundry, can treat kids but not in the manner what a woman can do. 

In america, where feminism movement started everyone now know whats the ground reality is, so they are not interested in marriage constitution any more. A large number of people have directed their minds into bf/gf culture or living in relationships. Where both gets benefits from each others physically but not into having family any more. Woman have to suffer a lot. She has to deal with her own health monthly with good amount of mood swings in addition to having pregnancy and pain during it. While giving birth she has to go through alot, and after that she has to be their for child for a good amount of time till the baby sitter thing.
This all brought them into not having family.

Japan and korea are good example of working of both genders. They're not interested in planning to have a family of their own . Family demands responsibility. And no one have enough time to take responsibilities other than work. They're working because they have to survive, and their sexual needs are already been meet. So what's the point of getting married and having child?? Their women have 0 birthrate expected in 2022. Pathetic.
There are unemployment because if both genders are working then there will be less opportunities for men to be able to run a whole family. That is why it is becoming a need to work both husbands and wives. And eventually time is near when they both will be no more interested in having a family.

So the conclusion is that, working of both genders leads to fall of marriage constitution. So if a man earns and provides for his family he demands respect in a positive manner because he's the one who remains out of the house in any season or condition to be able to provide. And woman should be respected because no matter what she's dealing with she's there for her child and husband to give them a good environment of home and care with love and kindness."

"This is very interesting topic, by feminism women think and prefer and ask for equality in positions of power, that is politics or possibly any such position, but doesn't equality mean equality at all levels? Would such a feminist woman choose a job of a scavenger? or bricklayer? or construction worker? i.e. a job that involves lot of hard work physically. if the answer is no then such women are not actually looking for equality but are looking for position of power under shelter of feminism. have a look at what Jordon Peterson has to say on this. it's wonderful discussion and how he has torn apart this so called fake feminist women seeding mass women with wrong idea about being a feminist."

"Putting men and women under the same banner of exploitation in a patriarchal society is dangerous. If someone says that the patriarchal system makes living difficult for men too, one must remember that it makes it worse for women. The level of freedom a man enjoys is far more superior than a woman. Moreover, when advocating for equality, one must always remember the biological differences between man and woman. A woman goes through a menstrual cycle every month and this period is extremely exhaustive both physically and mentally. Also a man cannot be pregnant. As such there cannot be equal treatment of men and women. A woman has to be given some concession on this ground. Also due to the fact that women are poorly represented (having less power)  in every aspect of life in a patriarchal society, they have to be given more rights sometimes over men, for instance, some specific laws in IPC which are deliberately made women centric."

"Women often talk about men having all the power, money, and control, oppressing women. However, it is important to note that this perception confuses a small percentage of wealthy men with the majority of men who struggle. Most men have no money, no power, no sex from their wife, and face difficulties in court battles, even losing their homes and the chance to see their children. Their lives are challenging.
The truth is -
~When a man earns he takes the responsibilities of family. When an women earns she becomes independent.
~When a man earns he may pick a no-earning women and makes her life-partner. When a woman earns she reject a men.
~A strong man can pick broken women and make her life strong. Strong women donтАЩt look after broken men."

"You know when people set their mindset they can twist any topic to their way of explaining. I am hundred percent sure if druve wanted to defend a criminal he can do it, (he will or not that's another topic)


I am giving you a recent example so that you can relate.

While the animal movie review he said it's affect on people mind set and whoever thinks like that way they get the validation when a hero does this toxic things.


But in this video he said feminist movie is not feminism, it doesn't showing original feminism, don't take it seriously.


If you think this movie don't showing original feminism then how can you judge animal or Kabir Singh movie basis on real masculinity. I can also say it also don't show original masculinity. (masculinity isn't beating or degrading women. Masculinity is providing and protecting women) 


If animal movie give validation to this kind of people's behavior then feminist movie also do the same thing.


It's ridiculous that when you don't like something you take small point and present it in massive way that, this is the reason why people mind are changing.

But when you sided with something you ignore the same point. It shows the partiality and biasness.

And I notice it quite some time. Though I like most of his videos because of logical point of view, research and information."

"Problem with feminism is it makes more father and less mother. When you have to take care of your babiesand feeding,you need female not male. But todays career oriented females are busy to compete with male coworker rather than take care of her family. And if father and mother both busy on working then total number of times to children decrease which caused todays addicted,rich chapri and weak generation just not having loves from parents. For feminist money is more inportant than their children. That is why we are watching news how children get out their parents from home beacause those children are unable to build connection with thier parents.
In feminism, their have no concept of modesty. How a modest woman can work with male coworker? Why is this male vs female? Why not female economic development with modesty rather than wanting same work that male are doing. Female should choose more work-from-home types work like crafting,online job,freelancing,clothing menufacturing etc. Amd one question: Why feminist think that household work is not a work?

"Men and women have differences. Due to these physical and emotional differences gender roles have been developed and due to these gender roles, humans have come to this era of development and prosperity. If there was no patriarchy, humans would have become extinct long ago. Since the world is at peace right now, these feminists movements have become widespread throughout the the world. But, if somehow an attacker with a gun breaks into the house, guess how will have to sacrifice his life to save his wife , or will the wife go to fight the attacker? Or if a war breaks out, who will be forced to fight ?MEN.
These feminist always say that men and women are equal, but when push comes to shove, it is Men who die in wars, work extreme jobs etc. Why don't they do it? 99% bricklayers are men, 90% mine workers are men. And they want equal pay when women don't even do these jobs that are the base of our civilization. They only want to work in the Air conditioned offices and want men as their slaves .

"The word ""feminism"" comes from the Latin word femina, which means ""woman"". The word ""feminism"" is a combination of the Latin word f─Уmina and the suffix ""-ism"". The suffix ""-isme"" comes from the Latin word тАУismus, which turns a noun into a practice, system, or doctrine.

1 . At 22:25 (Neha Dhupia Case).
As Dhruv Said No Feminist Supported Neha ,
But Also Mostly Feminist Never Criticized Neha.

2. 22:40 We See Mostly People Including Feminist Criticized This,
But Just Imagine If Same Would Have Happen Vice Versa. The Man Would Have Got Lott More Hatred.

If We See Feminism As A Equality Tool For Both Men & Women .
Then I Must Say I Support Feminism 
But The Definition The Feminist People Have Created Are One Sided .
Same Like This Video .

There Are Many Things About Toxic Feminism ,
but This Topic Was Left Behind & Only Men Were Being Criticized.

We Know Our Society Is a Patriarchal Society,
Just Because The Culture We Have Developed Is From Thousands of Years & We Can't Change This in Short Span.
But There Is Lott Of Improvement .

Just Some Of you Got Good Education & Awareness ,
Doesn't Mean We Are Dumb. Surely We Have Less Knowledge About Things.

"Women are equal to men ? Lets learn the truth 

1.Our bodies are different (structurally). That's not a false statement. That's just nature. There are differences in body 
2. Our strengths are different. That's why there is no wrestling/ufc/any other sports between men and women.(still it's bound to equality between women not men and women). Train a man and women for same time and lets see who will win.
3. If male and female were equal then why is there no general one quota for men and women in competitive exams. There is literally 50:50 ratio of boy:girl seats in that.... That's not equality... equality was when you just made one general quota where boy and girl compete for same seat. Take example of Cutoff of NEET in normal state of India.
4. Laws of constitution gives all the best rights to Female in marriage( even if women is wrong male still has to pay even after divorse) wtf
5. Remember when someone talks about equality between men and women = feminism It's bullshit.
6. Women are best in their own ways....A man cannot imagine a life without women... That's mind of every men out there....
There is always one girl(after mom) for which a man can giveup his life

Remember when it's a video about feminism...It is just one more way to make a man  ""g@y"".... that's how ""so called modern countries are now a days."""

"I donтАЩt agree with you 
Men and women are not equal just like in every species males and females have different ability for example a female athlete can never compete with an equal size opponent in race, boxing, or take any sport and about the brain how many inventions do women have 1 or 2 most of the inventions and innovations are done by men to this day then how can we say they are just equal no are they great in business how many women billionaires are there without divorced money or heritage money very few (ok India is not good at giving equal opportunity to women but what about the western countries) how many successful women entrepreneurs are there . Then in what sense can we say they are just as capable as men itтАЩs just dumb . If tomorrow Somalia (an African country) claims they are as equal, powerful and capable as USA would you just accept obviously not they have to prove it  so women given the time has barely proved anything but god gave women some abilities which a man cannot do as better as women like taking care of people, managing households, other caring jobs that why you see more female nurses than male because it suits their personality"
"Pehle sirf ladkon per pressure tha employment ka... ab ladkiyon per bhi hona chahiye kya, kya yehi equality hai? I'm sure that's not the narrative here from feminism. But that will be the end result. That's because regardless of the gender, education, culture, the world always had a majority of innocent and gullible people falling for a propaganda or some other narrative. Majority people will not learn the definition you provided for feminism. They will have their own interpretations, (perhaps guided by their inner devil or by greater good). That's why you see people talk more about women empowerment rather than men empowerment, you see more and more laws being prepared and passed in favor of women. If one side is making their own interpretations, there's another side taking advantage of this narrative. And the example I provided at the start is only one small case. The world was always a hostile place for humans, and men took the onus, or were told, to safeguard their women. As a counter argument, can you say why didn't were women told to protect men? All these arguments are for sure not part of that narrative, but that's what people will end up with. So, what's the best way out? Well, it's a complex world. Perhaps one lifetime isn't enough to know everything. If you're like Dhruv, you're in a better position to learn more and more about all the complexity that exists, but even still you'll never be able to honestly conclude anything precise on all that. Even with all sides being wise, the flow of arguments and counter arguments will never end. Perhaps that's why there's something called religion. Peace."

Beautifully explained!ЁЯОЙ
"First of all, there is a difference between rights and recognition. Women in today s world do have more rights (speaking in a Western region context). Countries such as Canada, US, NZ, AU, have more rights for women comparatively. It is also a fact that men and women are NOT THE SAME AND WILL NEVER BE THE SAME because of the concept of their creation. (i.e. Adam was created before Eve, and Eve was created to provide comfort and company to Adam). Because woman is the gender responsible for carrying a future generation, these countries recognize their rights and de facto rights were given to the mother (as long as the mother is proven to provide good care). So it is proven that literate society with intellectual understanding do consider human rights when it comes to women.

The argument now is on the equality basis. So all I can say is that men are not privileged and have to face the same kind of obstacles as women when it comes to leadership positions in society with respect to social, political, and ethical culture. One must prove themselves with determination. 

In my personal opinion, men and women are physically different, but psychologically, intellectually, and aesthetically are very much capable of standing equally right next to men. The differentiation point is the mindset of making a choice.  ""Normative Conformity""  is not being imposed on someone, yet it's that individual's choice to have the need to fit-in and that's not a societal issue. I consider it a personal issue. Issue that one does not have enough confidence to stand up for him or her self, issue that one is waiting for the society to make choices for him or herself. these are the issue in today's world where all the ""so-called Feminists"" are rising up and voicing out ridiculous concerns about women not having basic human rights. The narrative is so convoluted that women today are not abusing it and turning a legitimate concept into bullying men. Before even talking about Women are not have equal rights in today's world we should add more context to which region are talking about, analyze whether its a women's rights issue or human rights issue (which includes similar issues for men), and whether that region has judicial regulation to safe guard these human rights. if all the answers are YES, and still there are issues, than that's the criminal offense instead of just ""women equality""."

Is it because society teaches them that or is it because biological factor?
If you are going to say that men and women are quite then please talk about biological factors, million years of evolution, hormones, biological needs( while won't go away so easily) 
Yes men and women must have equal rights but we can't change the fact men biologically want certain things in their partner and same goes with women."

"Dude. That neena gupta clip is totally out of context. She meant to say тАЬsimilarтАЭ if you see the whole episode. People tend to use words like same equal and similar interchangeably.

She was narrating an incident where she said someone was following her continuously because of which she had to miss a flight, until she took a male friend with her to drop her at the airport. 

And I totally think that she is right!  Living in this society is easier for men than women. of course men have their own difficulties but always look at the ratio.

Coming back to your video I agree with like 90% of your video where you speak data and not opinion!

Love your work тШАя╕П but might not agree to certain segments of it."
"Dhruv bro

Equal opportunity and support in social environment will be required that agree.


Two queries
1) why the laws are missused by Female and men's are helpless in recent times starting with Jasleen kaur case?

2) Instead of equality when they live together equity will be required after understanding eachother weakness.Then only both can live together or else instead of living happily will live stressful. Isn't that right?"

Modern feminism is no longer what it used to be. Specially in west. It has become more and more radical where abortion is considered women empowerment instead of health issue. And women are taught to compete with men even if they choose to go to different path.

"Like to add a few points. I guess you missed another feminist name. Mr. Naseeruddin Shah. Regarding the movie Thappad the problem is not limited to slapping, but the husband being unapologetic about his wrong action. She waited long with expectation of regret from her husband which actually didn't happened, rather he along with all family members and freinds  normalizing the action. And the last point is about act of Neha Dhupia keeping there is not much difference between supporting and keeping mum. all Feminists should speak out against such toxic things else the whole message will be getting lost."

Why canтАЩt we just see those movies like a normal movie that revolves around the lives of four women without bringing any political agenda in between? Why do we watch movies where men are casually drinking, smoking and hooking up without being offended (it doesnтАЩt even come to our notice) but god forbid if a woman does the same, then we all say тАЬyeh hai tumhara feminismтАЭ. Why do we attack feminism whenever a girl puts false allegations on a guy? How does feminism gets in the way whenever a woman fucks up? The only reason behind all this is that we hate feminism for no reason and will never fail to shit on it whenever a woman does something wrong which is in NO WAY related to feminism. I will watch a video titled how some women can misuse the law, i will never watch a video titled how fake feminists put false accusations because itтАЩs clearly an agenda of the anti-feminists!"

"Obviously feminism and men and women having equal rights is really important but you can't just ignore the ""modern feminism"" so many young girls are following which is obviously destructive to the society as well as the relationship between men and women. 
Yes patriarchy oppressed women for so many years but that doesn't mean now it's time that men of this generation have to suffer. 
For example everyone says ""teach your son to respect women"" when it should be "" teach your children to respect others irrespective of their gender""
I wish dhruv would have talked more about how ""modern feminism"" is destroying our country just like it did to western countries. 
Men need to suffer in the name of equality and feminist is not the right way to achieve the goal."

"Being a long time viewer of your channel, I think this will be one of the very few videos where I think you didn't put out the whole picture about the voting issue.
Men got the right to vote before women because men were subject to military conscription. If you elected a representative to represent you in the government, that representative could then vote to send you to war. Men, being the exclusive victims of forced military conscription, were perceived to have more of a say and a right. But this privilege also came with corresponding responsibilities, such as the obligation to serve in the military and potentially sacrifice their lives on the battlefield. That's how men gained the right to vote before women did.
And I don't think a single woman would come forward today to die on the battlefield, if there's a World War III."
you know what....this video was more about patriarchalЁЯШЕBut the real problem is....todays some modern feminist are asking extra rights instead of equal rights.

"Same things same points that I know were said, but I expected him to talk more about how the laws in India made for women to protect them are misused and also how some section of women also promote these actions such as smoking drinking slapping and it's her choice thing as a feminist ideology but again it's common trend to blame men. I can also say it's patriarchal atitude to believe and say that only men associate the things which do not log belong to feminism. Why I am even typing no body in YouTube anymore types serious comments. I have gone to atleast three stages of life. My early days in 2018-2020 where i was far left and believed everything he said. My 2020-2022 days when I didn't believed a single thing he said. And now I just see whole video then try to form my own opinions. So as I said, he himself says not to generalize but he did generalized in the end saying these alpha male won't understand that feminism is not this. I will also like to add that no feminist opposes or raise their voice for men who get beaten by women. I will also say thanks for this video it showed me one new thing that any normal human being is a feminist. So my question is if any normal human being is a feminist. So why we need labels like feminist? Why not call a normal human just a normal human. Not that I have anything against feminist but feminist word comes with a lot of meanings these days while no one knows it's true meaning. Or that being normal is not normal so you give them titles like feminist. Nah man I am realist. Sorry I yapped. In end I just want to live my life as a normal human being who iso loved by someone atleast. Damn. Terrible day for rain. That suicide part. I relate to it. Not that I will do it, but I relate to it. 3 people around me died due to suicide. I should join them"

"I agree that women who discriminate or disrespect men are not feminists. But majority urban young women now have such mindset, even if its not feminism, whatever this syndrome is called its affecting a lot of people and to just end the conversation by saying that 'oh it was wrong' is just that - wrong. 
What majority of young women now call 'feminism' is actually the corruption & unfairness of patriarchy but they see it as a privilege and source of empowerment. So both the narratives of alpha male & female needs to go but again this video feels like you wanted to justify the current 'feminism' but didnt as u know it'll be wrong."

"Every rational and wise person supports feminism. Women should be given equal rights. It is ok to give equal rights and opportunities in education, job , sports etc. The issue arises when women start asking men to cook food and wash vessels. As a man I feel that we have been doing the harder things and evolved with different capabilities. For example if my job is to be a construction worker lifting heavy things, I cannot switch roles with my wife. She would rather feel safe and better to stay home and cook for the family.  Women are good at taking care of kids, men aren't. It isn't easy to switch roles and have equal duties for both in that case. Similarly there are many things which only men can do, but women aren't built to do and vice versa.  We need to understand our capabilities and roles and not keep cribbing about it. If there's a couple who work in a software company which doesn't involve any hard labour, then they can share the house chores equally. I would personally prefer my wife to be at home and take care of the kids and  household chores and cook good food for me when I am back from work, rather than both going out to work, having a maid to Cook for us and leaving kids in a daycare center. I think the majority of the women also would prefer the same coz that's an ideal scenario. The problem arises when the husband abuses his rights and suppresses his wife. That's when women feel the need to work and earn money to become independent."

It's 100% sure that men are physically stronger, women are more emotional, men are hard, women are soft etc."

"Video about feminists

Blames men for women being feminists"
"I disagree with everything in this video...
Why do we even need of two Genders? Why did not Homo Sapiens evolved into one gender? Wouldn't it be easier for us? At least there won't be any discrimination between Genders... 
It is not the problem if Female Genders become equal to Male Genders. The problem starts after they got equal, will they still want to co-exist with Male Genders as equals or will they try rise above Male Genders, usurp power and rule over them? If this is the case and after feminism, Female Genders create a matriarchal society then what makes it different from Patriarchy?
Either you rule or someone else will take your place...
Selling Feminism is like telling everyone that communism/capitalism/socialism theory is the right thinking, way of right path. Except it then the world will be a better place like ""God's Eden"". But we all can see what happens in real life implication."
Love you dhruv for the facts that you show us
Following this channel for the past year and this is definitely one of the best videos by the Dhruv Rathee Team. Much appreciate the efforts for shedding light on these topic in these times!

Men say women love to play victim ... no dude we just know how to express when we are being oppressed by patriarchy .. you guys have been told to suppress your emotions by the same patriarchy so u never raise questions because that system will tell u that u are less of a man...maturity is when we realize that both men and women are suffering because of patriarchy.
It's all lol
"The fact that you have put up everything in this video so intellectually 
I hope people watching this change their mindsets 
I as a female will stand for men's rights as strong as I'll stand for female's rights
It's not about male or female
It's about being a human & treating humans with humanity тЭд

"Just think about it, ever since women were introduced to feminism, a strong generation could not be formed. Women have the potential to create a powerful generation, something men cannot achieve. Whatever tasks Allah has assigned to each, they are the best at it. If you take kidneys to perform the function of the heart, the body will collapse, similarly, the generation has collapsed due to the difficulty and impossibility of both parents working. Look at Ambani; there is no heir after him who can manage his empire. Why? Because Nita Ambani did not give time to the children.

Either compare social media toxic men and women or compare sensible men and women.

"Hi dhruv bhaiya, it was a really great video and I loved the fact that you highlighted what actual feminism is and also the struggles of males due to patriarchy but there is still one doubt which lingers onto my mind is that just like how you criticised and told us about the toxic masculine culture I would also love to know something similar about the toxic feminism tho it's not something which can be compared with actual feminism just how toxic masculinity can't be compared to actual ideas of masculinity, but toxic feminism still remains there. There are many men out there who are subjected to fake harrassment cases, there are many toxic feminists who love to use there women card and also I have seen this circulating in western media that a lot of women out there have misinterpreted feminism and now they disregard men totally. At the end of the day I would like to say is I don't mean to generalise my views for everyone it's just as a 16 year old guy who has immense respect for women and men around him I would love to know the other end of the society of both the genders.

"Mai to ye soch Raha hu India me to ladkiyo ko barabar rights mile hain, har jagah reservation bhi mil gaya hai, to ab konse barabar rights chahiye?ЁЯШВ I think inko ab domestic inequality ke against laws chahiye. For example koi parent apni ladki ko raat me Ghar se bahar jaane se nahi rok sakta agar ladka bhi jaa raha hai to. 

Btw ladkiyo ke reservation se ek cheap harkat yaad aayi. Mai Delhi me rehta hu aur public transport bus se school jata tha, to maine ek didi ko notice Kiya hai (stalker nahi hu maiЁЯШВ aur wo didi kya insaan kehne layak bhi nahi hain) wo didi bhi mere hi time pe same destination tak jaati thi.

Matlab reservation de di govt ne to insaaniyat hi nahi bachi hai kuch logo me."

Despite the disapproval of her father-in-law, Priyogopal (Haren Chatterjee), the hesitant and nervous Arati soon begins to prosper in her field and gradually starts to enjoy her new-found financial and psychological independence."

"Respectfully disagree when you said, ""Society ye kahti ka tou aurat ki kamai khata"". Instead, there are researchers that women themselves leave their husbands when they are consistently earning more. The definition of feminism you stated was accurate in the past first wave but now has completely changed in the West. Instead, it is totally about killing genuine masculinity instead of just toxic.

"Totally agree with the root cause of feminism which is "" a woman is free to work if she wants to"" but disagree with the fact that a woman HAS to work and become equal to the man at all cost. It is obvious that one has to start a family and have kids, women whether they work or not have to look after the kids and house most you can observe this even in the west, thus this becomes triring for them and it would be cruel to force them to work as well as take care of children. If a woman decides to become housewife she is shamed by the modern world and labeled retarded. I believe this is against the root cause and even women in the west have started speaking up against it. This type of feminism is nothing but a capitalist agenda to get the whole household working and kids raised on ipads and social media. We need to get out of this"

Women are gifted the power to give birth to a child.

Men on the other hand are stronger physically on average.

Doesn't mean the women don't deserve equal rights. But.... To forcefully make sure there are 50-50 men and women in all fields? Is a bollocks proposal!"

Its all about who support gay rights and who like the straight order. And you can be referred a misogynist by a feminist when you dont support their right.

"Yes i believe in Equality , but this competition between male and females is baseless and has no scientific evidence showing society progress by giving equale roles and responsiblities to female as same as males. Feminism is a vague concept. This concept failed in west where this word orginated. Many females have accepted that by competing with males for roles and responsiblities have actually made their lives miseable . Its not that females are lower in any sense with males. Its just both are 2 phases of single coin. I know even after giving facts few female will say that i m patriarch saying to just prove patriarch is better . But my answer is no i do not want a society where male opresses females in any way. But at the same time competing with males taking masculin roles in family and society displaces males from there gender roles. And in long run this will disasterous. There is nothing wrong if female wants to help her family get job get equal right. But if it starts overburdening the family and society at large like why should only female has to do this why only we have sacrifice. Then society as whole will stsrt to fail. Ladies you need to understand that when dhruv showed example where females compromise he showed only one aspect , just remember your father and analyse, is he not sacrficing for family or compromising his happines over the family . Just ask for ur father whrn was the last time he bought new undergarment for himself. and yes it doesnt mean that if he sacrifices his happiness he got right to opress women of his family .. absolutely no."

"Bhai the problem is not women not speaking in favor of Neha Dhupiya or the girl who slapped the guy on the road senseless. Most men probably get agitated because women didn't criticize them either. Women usually don't go hard on women making mistakes like these but will write an entire thesis on men making mistakes and vilifying them (which is fair if the man has done that). This is obviously a personal observation. Women who make such mistakes are given a room and safe space to grow and ""learn"" from it. Men do not get that chance"

While I don't completely disagree with you, I think it's important for women to support their husbands from a slightly less visible position. It's not necessary for them to constantly prove their capability to the world. If we are assigning blame, it's primarily on us men because we tend to treat women as objects, although not everyone does so. Despite their position behind us, we still hold a great deal of respect for them. We acknowledge and admire the challenges they face in maintaining the family.

I agree and can relate to each and every words said by you...
"Those who give the reason of tradition for supporting patriarchy are truly irreligious people. Our culture is all about equality that's we say a wife as the ardhangini or the better half(equal). And you take up all the couple gods and goddesses you will find them completing each other. Like lord brahma, the creator will obviously need information or knowledge (DNA) to create life and he has mata saraswati for this the goddess of wisdom and knowledge. Lord Vishnu the preserver needs resources to preserve life and hence he has mata Laxmi, we worship her on Diwali too for good fortune and plenty of resources or money and success. And lastly devo ke dev mahadev, the destroyer needs power for destruction and hence Devi Parvati, Shakti. When Devi Parvati was troubled by some asuras she came up to mahadev and told him. He said why have u came to me go and fight urself. Why women have to seek help from their male counterparts? I have made them enough strong to protect themselves. And that's when she took the Kali avatar. And she was so angry at that time that lord Shiva had to come in disguise of a child to invoke her soft side. And the names Radha-Krishna, Laxmi-Narayan, Gauri-Shankar too say it all."

"Equality is a good thing, but can a woman do all the work that a man does without risking his life and sometimes losing his life?Can she do this by risking her life?Equality is a good thing for both, it should be there regarding studies, socially and politics just like as men but God has made woman soft and man hard so that they can work according to their body , in some activities and cases women cannot do that men can do even mindset needs ! Support feminists is a good but some women among these feminists, speak directly to the contrary and do not respect and by doing wrong things in the name of feminist and calling it equality and then later blaming people who do such like bravery works and hardworks Our soldiers work so hard to protect us in the war on our borders.  Whatever the weather, whatever it may be, they do very dangerous missions, construction works ,coal mining etc.. which are not so possible for a female and we have men who do such dangerous tasks which are very risky.  It requires a very strong mind and in such a situation, some people and women do not respect them for this.Some women and girls of today consider themselves feminist but they wrongly celebrate it as if they believe in foreign civilization, follow it and do not accept their Indian traditional and do not even respect them not good. That doesn't seem good today.  That's why an educated feminist is necessary to tell everyone this And should be accepted and told that feminist is a good thing.  Women should be given equal rights and privileges as men.  But there are some things which women cannot do.  They need men, so we should respect them, they don't understand this and it spreads wrong message in the society.  As Dhruv sir said that both men and women built differently by body structure by few 3 or 4 body parts are different but 70% structure is same functional  also difference is there emotionally built in comparison of both. our Women and our sisters are stronger today but women are also sweet and softhearted...but mostly mens are emotionally built very strong as compared to women...we should be an educated feminist, just remember a few things and learn them. Accept and respect some things that people need to accept I don't know how many people will call it good or bad but these things are true. Both women and men need in our society we should respect both and should be given equal rights to both ! But respect is only for good !!"
I am not agree with u this topic
Very true.women are more cunning and wicked.i have noticed this.
Thank you bhaiya for  everything
If i may ? I would like to pose an interesting question. Are all human beings truly equal ? these days everywhere you go there's a talk about fight for equality. As wise man once said heaven dose not create one person above or below another. People like to throw his words around. we are all equal at birth pretty soon things begin to change. Academic effort is what sets some people apart rise above the others . At any rate humans change over time based on their actions. Truth be told at the end of the day Equality is just a fantasy. And most of us go through life denying the fact that we live in meritocracy. Man and woman not equal .

"If you are a true feminist then you must cover the rising false rape and domestic violence cases on men by women in India. It destroys the man's life and the woman, even if proven wrong in court doesn't suffer from any legal action. 

Around 74% rape cases in India are false. High time this is taken up by the masses and force the government to amend laws, just like women rights have been awarded through people's voices."

"Problem is the word тАЬfeminismтАЭ. It comes from word female. Majority people didnтАЩt know the meaning of feminism and thought this resembles with female so should be about more rights for women or less rights for men which would look like more rights to women. Latter took precedence over many cases is itтАЩs sad reality. Even if you look at history the word feminism was coined to give more rights to women in 1800тАЩs. First change the name feminism with something gender neutral. Second rights are a choice I.e., full time dad has slowly becoming a norm. Similarly housewife is a choice. In an household wife is not managing house and husband works full time job then wife talking about equal rights! What is equal in it? Now letтАЩs take an example of 2 strangers man and women. If women slaps, man should definitely slap back. Man should not hold back thinking he has 10 times power to do a serious damage, is that what equal rights mean?  Men and women are not equal. One completes another. Rights are choices not necessarily actioned. For instance, you are on a date and you decide to pay the bill instead of spending splitting. Girl has the right to split the bill and boy also has the right to ask for share. Both have their rights but choice would make the difference. Agree??"

"Male aur female equal nahi hay aur kabhi ho bhi nahi shakta. Kuch aspects me male age hay aur kuch me female. Itna hi equal hay sab kuch to har sports me male female separate events keu hota ? Aaj se 50k sal pahle tak society me male aur female ke equal rights the , koi ek dusre ko nahi dabata tha ( Anthropological evidence hay , search in Google). Lekin uss samay tak insani sabhyata ka bikash lagvag na ki barabar hota tha. 50k sal ki baad se society pe mard rule karna suru kia fir aaj hum insani sbhyata mars tak pahach gaye. Jis chis se ham age bar rahe hay use reverse karne ki kya zarurat. Is faminism ki chutiappa bas last 200 salo se suru hua industrial revolution ki baad se . Keu ki industries me labour force bahut chahie tha isi lie aurat oo ko kaam karne kelie uksaya gaya. Lekin aaj bhi high risk wale jobs me ( army , sewerage cleaning, mining etc)  males kahi domination hay aur age bhi rahega. Keu ki in saab jobs me sports ki tarah aap seperate domain establish nahi kar shakte females ke lie. World ko rule aur dominate karne kelie aapko chahiye raw physical strength aur tough mentality jo sirf mard ke pass hota hay , keuki mother nature hame aisehi evolve kiya hay. Jin jin samaj aur desh me feminism ki increase hua hay , waha par family structure aur society bilkul tutne ki kagar pe hay sabkuch rahne ki bawajud. 

May females ki against nahi hu . May sabhi insaan ki bahut izzat karta hu aur yeh bhi kahta hu ki aurat ke bina insani sbhyata survive nahi kar payega. Lekin hame yeh bhi manna parega ki ek aurat kabhi bhi Usain Bolt ki record nahi tor payenge aur ek admi kabhi bhi ek bacche ki mentality ko ek aurat ki tarah acchi tarikese sambhal nahi shakega.

"Dhruv, You're totally right. Basically the point is, still people don't understand the feminism or the meaning it possess. Most of the chapri gang use this to justify any kind of problems caused by a woman.

Another thing, I think you should bring to limelight, the pseudo-feminism, its not the some chapri boys gang who don't know the feminism properly, there are some spoiled-girls too who justify any kind of violence or aggressive action against men as feminism act to demolish men instead of patriarchy. Most of the time they use the faminism term for their own benefit to play victim card. A lot of male suffers for wrong cases raised by women.

We want a world where everyone should have equal rights across the different types of religions, genders, castes and races. Want a world where nobody points a finger and say you are man, its your responsibility, you are a woman, its your responsibility, instead of all these we would figure out everything together, no gender duties."

Chapri ЁЯШЕ ki shamat lane wala dhruv rathe
"My ex left me because I'm not looking and poor compared to her, but i never talked that she has bad character, nor I don't know very deep about her personal relations, only thing I felt bad was she secretly maintained other relationship while having relationship with me, I came to know about it from others and then she confessed and broke up with me, I have confidence that I will earn decent money for basic living but from that day i don't feel about good my physical appearance, I have severe trust issues, and can't enter into any relationship with that trust issue, I don't think all women are evil, because I have sister and mother, if I think all women are same then they will also get included in that, in the same way all men are not evil, it's just that our natural tendency is to look for beautiful and loyal women who will not cheat us, in the same way women seek for good looking, strong and loyal men who will not cheat on her and her children (in case of searching partner for marriage)
I feel that in olden days women were not much educated so they used to marry any men selected by family, but now they are free to select according to their natural tendency, so this generation is hard to survive for bad looking and poor men like me and also bad looking girls, and if anyone thinks that beauty and love in people is subjective then go and marry poor short fat black bald men or women, partially it may be subjective but largely it is programmed in our biology"

"Being a girl, my father has given me equal rights like my brothers, and yes my brothers do cry, we support them emotionally. And my brothers support me in my career they always applaud whenever I get promoted. Yes we live in this society where I'm allowed to live my life freely."
"Not only are we physically different but also our hormones are different. Even though we possess equal intelligence, our brain functions in different ways. If you still think we are equal, ask yourself why ovulation created 2 separate genders? To procreate? There are lots of species in the world who can give birth while being the only gender in a given time in life. We are different because our differences complement each other. Even in the ancient world men went hunting and women took care of the children. We need each other to survive. But one must lead the way and men are doing this from the beginning of the world. Men are better at decision making. While women are more caring and nurturing."
buht badiya dhruv bhaiya.
you know but it is due to patriarchy that men are more likely to be successful because the competitiveness creates an environment for the stronger and does not favour the weaker. yes a lot of men are in depression but lot of them are successful and due to this disparity our society has come this far. talking about the effects it has on men not women.

"I agree with majority of the things but one thing i find it wrong, when u criticize those chapri thinking they don't want equal rights, u should considered who is running feminism movement these days. SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS! They are anti men, they are justifying casual sex as independence of choice, Movies like Four more shots etc aren't equally criticize like animal. Also these days pro women laws are heavily misused which create mistrust. Also if they do equal work they deserve equal pay. So it's responsibility of feminist to see how they want to portray this movement rather than those chapris."

"Men and women are not equal by nature. That's why you can see separate world cup football or cricket or other athletics. Similarly most of the cases, their instincts are also different. Yes, there are exceptions, but it's not justified that every men and women are similar. Besides, in an office, smart and bewakuf men are also not similarly treated. Smart males get promotions, increments, responsibilities while dumb males are only home to office to home. Nothing is equal. So the idea is irrelevant of equalizing."

"Thanks My Dear: Meri Request poori karne ke liye,

"I don't agree with a lot of things in the video.

In nature, men and women have been made different and hence both have got perks and disadvantages in different different conditions/situations. Hence men and women have been made equal by nature.

Eg. A woman is more capable of taking care/nourishing children/family. And men are more capable of being tough and being resourceful for the family. Now bcz of this biological truth, both have pros and cons. Like since woman is supposed to stay at home, she tends to have less 'freedom'. On the other hand man has got 'freedom' but has the responsibility of earning and risk of outside harms.

By artificially giving equal power to women, in reality we are giving more power to women and hence creating inequality.

Eg. By giving freedom and choice of choosing their romantic partners to women, society has taken away most of the power from men to get into a healthy relationship without compromising with his dignity.

I know it sounds complicated but it's true and difficult to explain in a comment."

"Give women a space where they are safe from eyes, hands and minds of perverts or manipulators at schools, colleges and workplaces instead of pushing them naked towards above mentioned characters. We vociferate about women's empowerment but are not able to create an environment where they don't have to interact much with men . There should be different sections ,  colleges, departments in private and government sectors for ""women only"" entry is allowed. Then you can see women being able to grow confidently and without being spoiled or utilized. Another benefit of doing that is the wives can be send to work without fear of having extra marital affairs. It may sound strange, some countries including Saudi has implemented this and succeeded till recent years. But sadly it' may not happen because people are attuned to free mixing."

Great content sir but the lady who speak Marathi she was true example of feminism you should watch her video thoroughly. She was forced to left the school due to marriage she raised her child made his career then she continued her study and became loyer at the age of 45 . Instead of earning money from her practice she decided to serve for society as many women used to misuse law which were made to protect women. She had saved so many lives and families .She used to teach both male and female for better understanding of relations and how can we make them better . She just want to reserve our social value of family which rapidly tends to become westernise

"Good explanation of feminism. But it should also be explained why feminism is gaining a bad reputation. 

Well to do women who claim themselves as feminists have started using feminism as per their convenience and as a tool. So people generally equate feminism to something negative. For example, you gave the example of arranged marriage which as you said can be attributed to patriarchal conditioning. However, many girls who call themselves feminists are still continuing the tradition. So thereтАЩs two sides of the coin and I felt this side wasnтАЩt explained."

"Can't believe Dhruv made Patriarchy sound bad. I thought he well informed about the topic he talks about, not in this atleast. Patriarchy or Matriarchy aren't bad. Because we need a head of the family whether Father (Patriarchy) or Mother (Matriarchy). We humans want a leader/head everywhere. Like PM for a country, Manager in an office, HoD in a department etc. 
The issue is with Misogyny (toxic Patriachy and Chauvinism) and Misandry(toxic Feminism and toxic Matriarchy) where one gender hates other gender. We need to address/discuss these two terms. Poor video. Looks like in last 5 mins, he realised he had to talk about the topic he mentioned in Thumbnail, so he was forced to add some content there about toxic feminism. Rest of the vidoe is all the every day rant we hear from uninformed people."

I feel even us girls should re-learn the REAL meaning of feminism which is getting blurred in today's time. Doing immoral and unethical things in the name of being equal to men is NOT feminism. And I hope such women would stop using the word 'Feminism' to justify their wrong actions. Cuz it makes other women suffer.

"You explained feminism really well, but I feel you have the responsibility to make a video against toxic feminism as well. You made a 20 minutes long video against Animal, exposing toxic masculinity, then why not make a similar video on toxic feminism???"
one sided thinking!
"I have a very different view from other contemporary views , I am neither a patriarchal nor a feminist, but I rather believe in considering eveybody as human, surely I am an admirer of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule and Savitribai Phule who encouraged Women's education , for me women should demand rights like equal education, equal pay, creation of a safe environment, stopping of crime against women etc., but what I am really against is putting posters and demanding rights like , right to smoke, right to consume alcohol (this actually only benefits the companies producing them), asking for right to have multiple partners etc.I call these things as pseudo-feminism,  infact on the other handI get impressed by how high a girl is educated , I always hate people who marry their girls when young and thus indulge in child marraige , my views is don't consider somebody as  man or woman but as human , and I completely disagree with the man loliness thing, it has more to do with being an extrovert or introvert rather than being a man or a woman , I myself share my problems or worries with my friends and also my friends do the same , infact many of my friends have also shared experiences of even their 'intimate' things, only the difference is that personal or emotional talks between two boys always remain only between two of them and that is why the outside world never knows about it, but personal talks between two girls may not always remain only between two of them."

"Appreciate the way he explained Feminism. In every religion rights of women have described and how can we exceed the limit. Let me share an example here
In Qur'an
The Koranic verse (4:34) that 'men are in charge of women
In Bible
(Ephesians 5:23). So man is designated the head of the woman in the same way as Christ is head of the church."
"I really like these kind off vids, it act as a proof for me wherever if i got stuck in any conversation with someone about topics like this. It literally represents all those thoughts of mine about feminism which i didn't know how to put into words till now. From not supporting the girl and drivers fight to kamala bhasin's ted x talk, from women also supporting patriarchy to become a feminist, from authors saying either a feminist or idiots to struggles and will of mahatma bhai phule , it all comes with a right message and conclusion.
But today's problem is that most of us believe in which is not the truth, the truth can be hidden behind the tag of kabir singh and animal and other issues ofc but what truly feminism wants to tell nobody cares about it"
"Whatever you said is definitely correct and the problem is no one understands this. I have often heard this that, ""That girl is one of those feminist types"", meaning she is a bad person. It is said in this way. Now there is another problem that has raised in India. As of 2024, women do have certain rights that empower them. One such is the dowry law, where the groom's family can be charged for dowry. Now as we know the seriousness of the dowry cases, the law has been made in a way to get swift action in case of a complaint. Adding into that, the law enforcement officials often times harass the accused. So in a false case, this can be a huge issue and this in turn is defaming the whole women empowerment agenda, and the mindset is being pushed to the same, ""ladki padh likh legi toh hath se nikal jayegi"" mindset. Now this is the same thing you mentioned in your video that, women are also the enemies of feminism. Personal motives and greed is just damaging the reputation of women. (Again, there have be 1000s of incidents of dowry where the grooms family may have even went to an extent to kill the wife, but if 1 women askes for divorce and alimony that is a way bigger issue on social media. Both are wrong according to me. But which one has more engagement on social media? Just see it.) 

Now there is an argument that - What rights men have that women don't? Yes as of 2024, women have all the legal rights that men have. But on the ground level the mindset as not changed. It is very common to hear, ""Why are you spending so much on your daughter's education, leave something for her marriage as well."" As of right now, the feminists' fight is with patriarchy and not the legal system. The legal system battle has been won for a while now. In the future, I want to see a society where women don't need the extra laws to protect them. When that happens, those alpha males will not have to worry about a women taking away 50% of his net worth."

"Mard aur aurat kisi idaray ke baghair barabar hain,
Agar yeh kisi idaray ka hissa hain to phir barabar nahin ho sakte isliye idaray mein kisi ek ko sarbrah banana padega, misaal ke tor par ek idaray mein agar do mard hain to dono mein se kisi ek ko sarbrah banana padega warna idara chal nahi sakega, aise hi agar aurat hai us idaray mein to sirf us ko bhi sarbrah banaya ja sakta hai phir un dono mardoon ko us ek aurat ki sarbrahai qubool karni chahiye taake idara sahi chal sake.
Aise hi shaadi bhi ek idaray ko wajood mein laati jis se ek khandan kuchh talluqat wajood mein aate hain. Yeh idara ek bachay ki zaroorat hai. Agar us idaray mein koi bhi apna kirdaar sahi se ada nahi karega to yeh idara bikhar jaega.
Is liye Islam ne yeh shaadi jaisa nizaam bataya aur yeh jab se insaniyat ki ibteda hui hai usi waqt se hai aur yeh tareeqa Khuda ne bataya hai."

"2:43
Dhruv bhai...
Aap apni baat kijiye gaa.

""Har samjhdaar aadmi feminist hee hoga"" ye kehna mei theek nahi maanta.

Aaj agar har aadmi ye kehna shuru karein....

ki hazaaro saalo se hum aadmiyon ne Army, construction, infrastructure, industrial processes mei bada se bada yogdaan diya hai...

  aur auraton ne aasaan kaam(housewife) hee kiya hai...

Toh aaj hame bhi house husband bann ne kaa haq chaahiye. Auraten border sambhaalengi, hum bacche sambhaalenge.

Ab socho...
Aisi soch waale aadmi se koi shaadi karna chaahega? 

Meri raaye mei koi samjhdaar aurat toh nahi karna chaahegi.

Theek usi tarah, aaj Indian men(incl. Myself) marriage ko leke kaafi serious hai.

Kyunki Ladkiyon ke dimaag feminism crap se bhar chuka hai, jaise...

Aadmiyon ne auraton ko control Kiya hai...
Kewal bacche paida karwaane ki machine banaakar rakha hai...
Naukraani banaakr rakha hai...
Slave bana rakha hai...
Wagarah dhimkaana.

Aaj west iss pareshaani se ubhar raha hai, aur India iss pareshaani mei ghusaa jaa raha hai.

Rathee ji, aap feminist ho, aap baraabari ki baat karte ho...
Toh iska matlab ye nahi ki khudd parr samjhdaar hone kaa thappa laga do....

Mei nahi maanta, that men and women are equal.
Men and women have different responsibilities, different psychologies, different biologies.

Please ponder on this."

Raam and Ravan were both the greatest patriarchal mythological characters.
"Equal rights ke naam par vo kuchh bhi kare ,Gali de,saare legal laws favour me ho,kuchh bhi Bolney ka haq ho, thik"
"This is my take and I do not know how many agree:
I am against feminism, the concept that women and men are equal. Women are more precious than men, they need more protection and men should protect them.
A brother should protect his sister, a son should protect his mother, a father should protect his daughter, a boyfriend should protect his girlfriend,  a husband should protect his wife and finally any man should protect any woman.
The sad part about feminism is it is gaslighting women and turning them against men. While there are a minority of animals who call themselves men, majority of men are normal human beings who believe women are human beings just like them, specially the newer generation is more commendable in this regard. 
Those who say women are equal to men are stupid, of course they are physically and mentally different. Women and men are opposites, opposites attract and create a beautiful balance in life.
All we need to do is acknowledge that both men and women are human beings with their differences. 
Human rights and laws should be designed to empower the weaknesses and punish injustice against both men and women. 
Replace feminism and patriarchy with humanism."

Mens dont want women to be equal to them because if they are equal to them they would teach their kids what is right and wrong and this is what politicians dont want as people without ability to identify what is right or wrong may open peoples eye that what really is democracy
So sir when a patriarchal women also fight for feminism can't be considered a matriarch? Because they want equal rights but also with their conditions in which they have patriarch thinking. What I am noticing happening is that those who carry the flag of feminism are more a matriarch or patriarch because they want rights but with conditions so this is what making society more toxic. Thanks for the video sir equality should be given but also society needs to be educated well to stay away from those men and women who can't define actual feminism and carry flag or patriarchy or matriarchy.

 And if you believe one of them in abundance, do not take anything from it.

                 When God has made it permissible that the husband can give even one quintar as dowry, then who are you to forbid it?  Hazrat Umar heard this and said: You are all more knowledgeable than Umar.  This woman's freedom of opinion was not undermined as to why Hazrat Umar was criticized and objected to;  Because Hazrat Umar's conversation was about priority and virtue.  Self was not justified.

                 This proves that women have full right to their freedom of opinion;  Even Islam gave slave women the right to have their own free opinion.  And it had become so common that the Arab slave-girls used to act on it without any hesitation.  used to offer and they did not feel any danger or disobedience. (20)

"The same moral of budha, i saw rahul Gandhi saying it.

"(4) The right to property: In this way, whatever property a woman gets from dowry and inheritance, she owns it completely;  Because he does not have any financial responsibility;  Rather she receives from all;  So all this is safe with him.  If a man wishes, he has a double share in the inheritance;  But it has to be spent on the woman in every situation, so in this way the financial condition of the woman (in the Islamic society) becomes so stable that sometimes she is in a better condition than the man.

                 (5) Then she spends her wealth wherever she wants, no one has authority over it, whether she gives it to her husband or her children or gives it to someone else or gives it in the way of God, it is her own will and if  If she earns by herself, then she is the owner;  But her maintenance is obligatory on her husband, whether he earns or not.  In this way, the economic right given by Islam makes the woman so strong that no matter how much the woman is grateful;  While women are completely deprived of these economic rights.

Civil rights

                  Choice of husband: In relation to the choice of husband, Islam has given a large degree of freedom to women.  In connection with marriage, the will of the girls and their permission has been declared essential in every situation.  The Prophet said:

                 A married woman should not be married unless she is consulted, and a virgin should not be married without her permission. (13)

                 If someone has been married in childhood, the girl's will is not included in it when she becomes an adult, then she has the right to reject this marriage, in such a case no one can force her.

                 Yes, if a woman wants to marry a person who is immoral or against her family, then in such a case the saints will definitely intervene.

 Right to eviction

                  Islam has given the right of divorce to the woman, that if the husband is unfaithful and incompetent, the wife can annul the marriage and these rights are granted through the court.

 Right to good society

                 It is commanded in the Qur'an: Be kind to women (Al-Nisa': 19). Therefore, the husband is instructed to treat his wife with kindness and generosity.  There are those who are good towards their wives and treat their families with pleasure and kindness.

The social position of women in the eyes of Islam

                 The social position of women in Islam is so high that it can be inferred from the fact that in the matter of socializing, Allah Ta'ala specifically addresses men and orders that in the matter of socializing with them, ""  to be considered ""well-known"";  So that they behave well in every aspect of society and in everything.  It is said that:

                 (Al-Nisa': 19)
  And live with these women in good company, if you dislike them, then it is possible that you dislike something and Allah will put a lot of good in it.

                  Society means living together, in this sense, Allah Almighty has ordered men to live together with women in the Holy Quran.  The second is that it has been tied to the ""known"", and living a known life means that one should be very polite and polite in conversation, be gentle and loving in one's words, not be bossy and listen to one thing with attention and  Don't be disrespectful, and don't show any sense of humor. (19)

Right to freedom of opinion

                 In Islam, women have the same right to freedom as men, whether it is a religious or worldly matter.  He has every right to exercise his opinion freely like a man within religious boundaries.

                 On one occasion, Hazrat Umar said: ""You people are warned not to over-tie the dowry of women. If over-tying the dowry was magnificence from the point of view of the world and it was a matter of piety in the eyes of Allah, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)  would have been more deserving.

Bhai tumhara mom tum ko ache parvarish di hai aap bhi visa he do na
"It is a very difficult and delicate task to deduce issues and give fatwas in the light of the Qur'an and Hadith;  But still women were not behind in this field;  Rather, they were opponents of the Companions of the Prophet, some of whom are mentioned.  For example:

                 Hazrat Aisha, Hazrat Umm Salama, Hazrat Umm Atiya, Hazrat Safiya, Hazrat Umm Habiba, Asma bint Abu Bakr, Umm Sharik, Fatima bint Qais, etc. were prominent.

Social field

                 Just as other societies tried to eradicate women from life like a thorn, on the contrary, Islamic society has given her more priority and honor than men in some situations.  The person who came as a mercy to the world (Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace) announced the following message to this oppressed class:

                 I love woman and fragrance among the things of the world and the coolness of my eye is placed in prayer.

                 This proves that disgust and hatred of women is not an argument for piety and piety, a person can be beloved of God when he appreciates all the blessings of God with which He has blessed His servants, His order and beauty.  Be desirous of and treat women properly.  This is the reason why marriage has been made obligatory for both men and women.

                 Marriage is my sunnah, whoever turns away from my sunnah has nothing to do with me. (10)

                 Therefore, a woman as a wife is the queen of her husband's house and the teacher and mentor of his children.  It is stated in the Holy Quran:

      (Al-Baqarah: 187) Women are your clothes and you are theirs.

                 It means that the personality of both of you is completed by each other.  You are a source of beauty and beauty for them, and they are a source of beauty and adornment for you. There are many thirsty aspects in the life of both of them, which do not reach completion without each other. (11)

Economic rights

                 Respect in society depends on economic status.  The one who has perfect wealth, people look at him with respect and the one who does not have it, people do not even bother to pass near him, respect is a distant thing.  All the societies and systems of the world kept women economically weak, except Islam, then this economic weakness became the cause of her oppression and poverty.  Western civilization wanted to cure this oppression of women.  And forced the women out of the house and put them to work in factories and other places.  In this way, women earning outside the home became the cause of many other problems, in these situations Islam is the only religion that took the path of moderation.

                 (1) The non-maintenance of a woman is the responsibility of a man in every situation.  If there is a daughter, it is the responsibility of the father.  If it is a sister, it is the responsibility of the brother, if it is a wife, then the husband is obligated to pay for it, and if it is a mother, then its expenses are the responsibility of her son.

            (Al-Baqarah: 236)
 A prosperous man should give sustenance according to his ability and a poor man according to his ability.

                 (2) Dowry: It is obligatory on the man to pay the woman's right to dowry.  Allah Ta'ala says in the Holy Qur'an:

                 (Al-Nisaa: 4)
 Pay the dowry of women with pleasure, if they forgive you some part of it with their pleasure, then eat it with pleasure and relish.

                 (3) Inheritance: According to some religions, women have no right to inherit;  But unlike these religions and societies, Islam gave women a regular share in inheritance.  (Al-Nisa': 11) That is, a woman's share is half that of a man, (the reason for which is not the occasion to explain) in the same way, she is entitled to a regular inheritance from her father, husband, children, and other close relatives.

"No doubt
Nakli feminists harm females whereas nakli patriarch harms  males. So taste the Flavour of hypocrisy and contribute to Bring Equality."
"When women declare that we are superior to men, that we do not need them, that men should weep, and other such statements, it is not about feminism; rather, it is extreme feminism.
The second issue is that women seek equal representation in higher positions, which is incorrect in and of itself because employers only choose hardworking individuals; women are not qualified for such positions.
Third, men and women are not the same; men are taller, faster, and stronger than women. Men perform all the physical labor in the world, including building houses, roads, bridges, mining for minerals, producing gas and other earthly oils, and engaging in sports.  

The fourth is that women ought to acknowledge that men are the world's providers and guardians."

"Remember the time when the girl who was buried alive will be asked for what crime she was killed.

                 On the one hand, the promise of hell was announced for the cruelty and abuse done to these innocent people, on the other hand, the good news of heaven was given to these people.  May the Jinns be free from this cruelty and treat girls the same as they treat boys and do not make any difference between the two.  Therefore, Hazrat Abdullah Ibn Abbas says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that whoever has a daughter should neither bury her alive, nor treat her with contempt, nor should he prefer his son over her.  Allah will admit him to Paradise (4).

 Woman as a human being

                 The first favor Islam did to women was that it changed the thinking and mentality of both men and women about the personality of women.  Determined the position, rank and dignity of woman in the heart and mind of man.  He fulfilled the duty of his social, cultural, and economic rights.  In the Qur'an it is said:

                 (Al-Nisaa: 1)

                 Allah created you from a human (Hazrat Adam) and made him his wife.

                 Therefore, men and women are equal in being human.  Here, for a man, his masculinity is not something to be proud of, nor is his femininity a source of shame for a woman.  Here both men and women are dependent on man and man is the great masterpiece of nature in terms of his creation and attributes.  Who is the most respected person in the entire universe in terms of his qualities and characteristics.  It is stated in the Qur'an that:

                 (Surah Bani Israel: 70)

                 We gave the children of Adam greatness and honor and gave them a ride for dry land and dry land.  He gave them sustenance of pure things and gave them superiority over many things among His creatures.

                 And he said in Surah Altin

                 We created human in the best shape and form.

                 Therefore, Adam was given superiority over all the creatures and the woman has an equal share in the honor given as a human being. (5)

Women's right to education

                 Human progress depends on knowledge. Any person or nation without knowledge is left behind in the process of life.  And because of his dull mind, he cannot think much ahead in the stages of life, nor does he see any possibility of material progress;  But despite this, a long period of history has passed in which the need and importance of knowledge for women was ignored and its need was considered only for men and even among them, those belonging to a certain class only got that knowledge.  used to do and the woman used to live a life of ignorance far away from knowledge.

                 But Islam declared knowledge as a duty and opened its doors for both men and women and removed all obstacles and restrictions. Islam gave special attention to the education and training of girls and encouraged it.  As the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Seeking knowledge is a duty.

                 Whoever has three daughters, then they are educated and married, and good to them, they are destined for Paradise (6).

                 He who brings up three girls, educates them, marries them and treats them well (even afterwards), then for him will be Paradise.

                 Islam addresses both men and women and has made everyone bound by worship, ethics and Shari'ah, which is not possible without knowledge.  Without knowledge, a woman can neither protect her rights nor fulfill her responsibilities that Islam has imposed on her;  Therefore, the education of men as well as women is very important.

                 Just as knowledge spread among men in the past, it also spread among women.  Among the Companions, women who have knowledge in the Qur'an and Hadith are found in sufficient quantity.

Bhai modiji feminist hai kya triple talak htane ke liye?
"By: Nagmah Parveen, Research Scholar
 Department of Theology, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh
                 History is a witness that women have been oppressed for a long time.  In Greece, in Egypt, in Iraq, in India, in China, in every nation in every region, there was no such place where the mountains of oppression against women did not break.  People used to buy and sell it for their luxury and they were treated worse than animals;  Even the people of Arabs considered the existence of women as a source of shame and used to bury girls alive.  In India, the husband's widow was burnt on the pyre.  Vaishnava religions considered women as the source of sin and the door of iniquity and the embodiment of the papacy.  Belonging to him was considered a hindrance to spiritual progress.  In most of the civilizations of the world, it did not have a social status.  He was looked down upon.  She had no economic and political rights, she could not freely transact.  She was submissive to her father, then to her husband, and then to her male children.  He had no will of his own, nor did he have any power over anyone;  He didn't even have the right to cry.

                  There is no doubt that at times the power has been in the hands of a woman and the government and empire have been circulating on her cues, thus she dominated the family and the class;  But on some issues, a woman had supremacy over a man, there are still tribes where women have the upper hand;  But as a woman, her situation did not change much, her rights continued to be encroached upon and she remained the oppressor of the oppressed. (1)

                 But Islam is a religion that has done great favor to woman and brought her out of the pits of humiliation and humiliation when she had reached the extremes of it, she was being refused even to acknowledge her existence, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)  Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, came as the mercy of the worlds and he saved the entire humanity from this fire and also took the woman out of this pit.  And give immense rights to this woman who bury alive and what is the importance of women in the national and national life, and entrust her with the responsibilities according to her nature.

                 Western civilization also gives women some rights;  But not as a woman;  Rather, it honors him when he is ready to take on the responsibilities of being an artificial man;  But the religion called by the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gives her all the honors and rights as a woman, and has imposed on her the same responsibilities that nature has entrusted to her (2).
Usually the weak have to work hard to get their rights.  Then they go somewhere and get their legitimate rights, otherwise it is not even imagined.  The present era after its discussion, analysis and protest recognized some basic rights of women and this is considered as the grace of this era;  Although this favor belongs to Islam, it first gave women the rights that she had been deprived of for a long time.  Islam did not give these rights because the woman was demanding this;  Rather, because these were the natural rights of a woman and she should have got them.  The position and status of women in the society defined by Islam is free from the absurd traditions of the modern and ancient times, neither is a woman allowed to be oppressed by making her an idol of sin, nor does she have the same freedom as in Europe (3).

                 Here the rights that Islam gave to women are mentioned;  Rather, he also issued an order to pay it through incentives.

Right to keep women alive

                 The situation of women in Arabia was the same in the whole world;  Some Arab tribes used to bury girls.  The Holy Qur'an strongly threatened him and gave him the right to live and said that whoever turns away from his right, God will have to answer him on the Day of Judgment.  He said:

"I have a good amount of respect for your contents..Their quality and information is commendable..Which is also applicable to this.
But I beg to differ in this case,
What i understand is patriarchy has a massiive impression in our society even to this day.
But for this to happen there should have been a minimum or almost nil oppostion from the other gender almost through out our history.
This could have only happened if women were ok with patriatchy in the olden days.
So why would women who now want equal rights be ok with their share of rights mostly as homemaker back then.
The most obvious answer I find which most of the modern women would find hard to swallow is back then life was tough.There were no luxurious jobs back then.
Considereing from the early ages where you had to go out in the wild fighting wild animals and all sort of unknowns and bring back food on the table to the ages where war and expansion had left life on uncertainaities.
Until those days no women considered equal rights to be an issue , no one said i'll go to wild and bring food on the table, its my right too or no one said you sit back home look after the kids while I guard our house or fight battles or mend shoes or cut the wood, or go trading to distant unknown lands or go fishing in the stormy oceans..
But suddenly after the barbaric, battle thirsty era, close to the 18th century came the industrial revolution, which along brought new and comfortable jobs in the market.And this is when the word feminism suddenly sprang up.
This is when some women remembered that they had been subjected to cruelty and unfair treatment as a member of society the entire history of human kind.
Well forgive me but this is not feminism i believe it is but obvious opportunitism(if at all theres a word).
If you wanted equality you should have asked for it when the storm was rising not in a sunny lovely morning after it has passed."

"Instead equal rights should be given to men there is reservation everywhere for women
The selection should be based on merit and not on gender
And about people saying about social equality, it will come with time, the mentality 10 years back is not today and will change after 10 years the reservation is only benefited by the upper middle educated class who doesn't work hard enough 
Mentality in villages will change with education and time only and not with reservation"

"Topic - T0xic femini$m, content of the video is : how alpha men are wrong, femini$ts do not support t0xic women when it is not the case , men who criticize t0xic women have double standards. Men who critize t0xic women do not want women to have equal righths.

Disingenu0us is an understatement to define ththis video. Same with all left piigs so passionate about holding men accountable but all sorts of ment@l gymnastics, excuses to deflect bl@me on t0xic women.

Made an entire video on animal and how t0xic it is yet ""thank you for coming, four more shotss"" in the video which is peak t0xic femini$m is skimmed over and almost not talked about other than a criticism.

preach morality to men, make excuse for t0xic women is the motto of the left , and the moral high ground left piigs have is the funniest of all. what a freaking joke."

Being a feminist, I always had heated arguments with some of my acquaintances that Feminist means 
""Going against men""
""Giving more power in the hands of woman""
etc.
And I just ignore them after some point cause I know there is no point on wasting time with patriarchy mentality people.
But I know the true sense of being a feminist and I'm proud of it.

In today's era, many of our woman and man don't even know what feminism is.

On the emotions topic
I'm 21 and I do still cry on small things and it makes me feel better sometimes.
I do cry when I'm working hard on something and not getting results but that doesn't demotivate me cause I know it takes time.

I surely hope that someday our people will know the true meaning of FEMINISM cause it takes time but people will understand.

FEMINISM means ""EQUAL RIGHTS OF MAN AND WOMAN"" or ""EQUALITY"".тЭдтЭд"

"its not like sigma male people want to discourage feminism, but many women who believe in feminism as women should be superior than men, so that's why we find two sides in social media arguing about non-sense. An intelligent person would never promote a superior men or women society. And it's very much evident that when something injustice is done to men we rarely find feminist supporting them. I feel like the society has a wrong perception about life, almost every one has alter ego '' A will to prove that they are superior and wanting to prove their dominance ''within them that supports them doing these sort of things in life. People need to be socially educated and behave with common sense."

"The passage discusses the equality of men and women within institutions, arguing that without proper leadership, institutions cannot function effectively. It suggests that just as in an institution with two men, one must be chosen as the leader, similarly, if a woman is part of the institution, she too can be chosen as the leader. Furthermore, it proposes that in such cases, men should accept the leadership of the woman to ensure the proper functioning of the institution. The analogy is extended to marriage, considering it as an institution that brings families together and requires the proper conduct of all parties involved for its stability. The passage concludes by suggesting that Islam has prescribed marriage as a system that has been in place since the beginning of humanity and is ordained by God for the proper management of human relationships."

"I completely agree with every word in this video, there are people spoiling the image of women, and there are people spoiling the image of men, these two groups fight all day try to enrage people into joining them, but there are so many more people who do great things and want to love in this world equally and peacefully, the difference is where you look. Men and women are meant to be equals and friends, not try to constantly prove that one is better than the other."
"I agree whatever dhruv said but the fact is modern feminism is only about hating men, drinking, smoking, wearing short clothes, not having kids, not getting married, etc. Modern Feminism only exists when it benefits them. They want all good things that a man can have but dont want bad things that a man has to face. Feminists never fight to take responsbilities for family, they never fight for men right, they never fight for false r@pe cases that a man has to face, etc. They are fighting for rights which benefits them. Harsh but true."

""" Modern Research "" 

In recent times, it has been accepted as fact, on a purely academic level, that fundamental, inborn differences do exist between men and women. A detailed article on the status of women in the Encyclopaedia Britannica includes a section on тАЬScientific Studies of Male-Female Differences.тАЭ Here the author points out physical differences in the respective constitutions of the male and female of the human species. тАЬWith respect to personality traits,тАЭ he writes, тАЬmen are characterized by greater aggressiveness, dominance and achievement motivation, women by greater dependency, a stronger social orientation, and the tendency to be more easily discouraged by failure than men.тАЭ40 And there are a number of latter-day scientific experiments to back this up. Researchers have found greater dependence and docility in very young girls, greater autonomy and activity in boys. One such experiment was conducted in the U.S. When a barrier was set up to separate youngsters from their mothers, boys tried to knock it down; girls cried helplessly. There are personality differences between the sexes too. Some distinctions turn up remarkably early. At New York University, for example, researchers have found that a female infant stops sucking a bottle and looks up when someone comes into the room; a male pays no attention to the visitor. Scientific researchers almost unanimously agree that hormones help determine how people feel and act. Thus the male-female differences are entirely genetic in nature. The passivity found in women is due to the particular nature of the female hormones. Differences between male and female hormones exist from birth: they are not acquired later, as would be the case if they stemmed from differences in environment. The tenets of Islam are based wholly on nature. This is because Islam is the religion of nature. The laws Islam requires us to follow are, in fact, our own instinctive human requirements expressed in legal terms. And the teachings of Islam with respect to women are no exception. They too are based on nature. Modern, psychological, biological and anatomical research proves women to be more passive than men. This is the way their Maker has fashioned them. The nature of their womanhood, the special part they have to play in society, demand that they should be just as they have been made тАФ that is, relatively delicate as compared to men. It is this fact of nature on which Islamic teachings have been based. Because of womenтАЩs delicate constitution, Islam teaches men to be gentle with them. That way they will not lose heart or become too despondent to perform their special duties in life. Women are not like iron and steel ribs: they are fragile and delicate. It is best to let them be, in their natural state. If one treats them as though they were tough metal, one will only break them."

Chapri log
"Thanku dhruv.. Clear, precise.. As a woman even I couldn't explain this so intricately.. U r the real hero of human kind!!!"
"Feminism first began with a noble concept of giving women equal rights as men in the society. But now third wave feminism is about giving women power over men. Third wave feminism teaches women that it is empowering to make coffee for your boss but demeaning to do the same for your husband, it teaches that marriage is a symbol of patriarchy and hookup/ promiscuity is a progressive thing, it teaches women to take half of the property of your husband in divorce but give minimum financial/ physical effort in the marriage, it encourages women to hit men but teaches men cannot hit women. It encourages society to make reservations for women in powerful positions like politics/ business but doesnтАЩt encourage women to do dangerous jobs that men did for thousand of years like construction, militaryтАжetc. The ultimate goal of third wave feminism is to give women authority of a man, privilege of a woman and accountability of children. 3rd wave feminism should be stopped as soon as possible or else our birth/ marriage rate will fall like Japan, South Korea and other industrialized nations who let this toxic ideology run wild."

You simply neglected that for majority of girls feminism means only equal rights for women and not for Men. You can easily find girls on social media defending same gender even if they r wrong but instead You used word chapri ladke and critisized them but continuously neglected other gender role. And btw Boys will be Boys is just a meme like any other meme without making any sense for anyone or taking it seriously.
Very sensible video
Superb
"Dhruv great topic I feel India requires it.
Well researched and agree with almost everything you had to say.
At 10:00 there is this excerpt ""Nature does not create hierarchies..."" 
Which is factually incorrect. Nature creates hierarchies between Species, Genus and Social Groupings.
Infact even societies and companies function out of hierarchies.
We don't know any other system that would work.
Coming to Feminism and Hierarchies, it is more likely due to the woman bearing a child that it becomes difficult for them to rise the corporate ladder so to speak. 
That being said there are extremely driven ambitious women out there who do so, but they would be far and few outliers.
Radical Feminism posits that society is fundamentally structured by a pervasive system of patriarchy. This perspective is considered risky to adopt.
JP has some interesting views on the subject.
Again thank you for your contribution in bringing such topics to the mainstream.
I wish you can create a dialogue too, your monologue game is cracked :)
Cheers"

how do you know whats an actual ideal women?? regardless of what you say why should I believe you? after all its your subjective morality.  how can you prove if something is ideal without objective morality? who decides whats right and whats  wrong?  the only answer to this is religion and god. if we cannot believe in the texts of our holy books regardless of the  religion we follow then  everything  becomes subjective. you have no right to tell someone that their believe is wrong without objective morality.

He chose topics of current affairs and politics more often then. Like your senior in college or neighbourhood is telling you, educating you and making you informed. Now itтАЩs feels he is trying to shove the content down our throats. Now his channel is becoming like any other random YT channel making videos about in a manner like тАЬ aao bhai aao maine ye padha / jana hai aur ab tum bhi isey sunoтАЭ .

""" A Closer Look "" 

Western women have come out of the house and into the marketplace in full force, but a closer look raises the question as to how much of this is тАЬliberation,тАЭ and, even more important, what is its cost in human and social terms for women and for society. In 1990, 53.5 million women, or 58 percent of all American women, were in the labor force тАФ three fourths of them working full time. From 1975 to 1990, 20 million women had been added to the work force. Labor force participation of all women between 16 and 65 years of age rose dramatically, but the steepest increase was among married women with a husband present in the home. In 1990, nearly 60 percent of all married mothers with children under six years of age were working outside the home. In 1980 less than 20 percent of married mothers with toddlers under three years of age were fulltime workers; by 1990 more than 33 percent of these mothers were in the work force. Though women have made substantial advances in professional, technical and administrative-management occupational areas, they are still overwhelmingly employed in the administrative support occupations, including clerical and secretarial jobs, and services (such as sales-girls, waitresses, hairdressers, etc.). In 1975, only 5.2 percent of employed females were in executive, administrative or management occupations, whereas by 1990 this had grown to 11.1 percent. Similarly, in 1975, 13.2 percent of employed women worked in the traditional professions (i.e., as physicians, lawyers, registered nurses), and 2.7 percent worked in technical and related professions but, by 1990 this had increased to 15.1 percent and 3.5 percent respectively. In 1975, 63.7 percent of female employees were confined to four areas тАФ namely, sales, administrative support, private household and other service occupations. In 1990 58.6 percent of employed women still worked in these fields. So, although women in America are now 13.9 percent of all police and detectives, 19.3 percent of all physicians, 36 percent of all computer programmers, 43.5 percent of all manufacturing assemblers, 44.3 percent of all financial managers and 51.5 percent of all bus drivers, they are also 99 percent of all secretaries, 89.2 percent of all textile sewing machine operators, 84.8 percent of all health aides and 80.8 percent of all waitresses. Among government employees, though women are a minority at the highest grade levels, their representation there has been increasing sharply. For instance, in 1982, 22.4 percent of the employees in Grades 11-12 and only 9.7 percent in Grades 13-15, were women. By 1988, 31.9 percent of Grades 11-12 employees and 15.9 percent of Grades 13-15 employees were women. Still, the bulk of women in government employment are concentrated at the six lowest grades. In 1982, and still in 1988, fully 75 percent of the employees in the lowest six levels were women. Though the pay gap between men and women has closed somewhat, and more so in some occupations than in others, discrimination in earnings and benefits remains pervasive. In 1980 women earned, on average, 64 cent for every dollar earned by men in the United States; by 1990 it was 72 cents. In certain areas, such as technical, sales, administrative support and service jobs, the male-female wage gap narrowed in recent years as much because of declines in menтАЩs salaries (due to recession condition) as of increases in womenтАЩs wages. As of 1989, women were still more likely than men to be working at minimum wage jobs. Female workers were less likely than males to have employer or union-sponsored pension plans in 1987 (but between 1980 and 1987 the proportion of male workers with pension plans dropped by 6 percentage points). In spite of the fact that nearly half the American work force consists of women, neither maternity/paternity leave nor childcare support was by any means the norm in American firms, even in 1989. At that time, no more than 3 percent of medium and large size firms, on average, provided paid maternity leave, and this went down to 2 percent for small firms (with less than 100 employees). In 1988, more than 60 percent of American children under age 18 had working mothers, but as far as childcare assistance is concerned, no more than 10 percent of firms of all sizes provided any real benefits or support for childcare. However, 35-45 percent of all firms did provide flexible schedules and flexible leave times for parents with young children. тАЬFlexitimeтАЭ notwithstanding, in 1987 6.2 million working mothers in America paid for childcare. Of these 750,000 had incomes at or below the poverty line, and for them childcare expenses ate up 20 percent of their income. Though mothers with children under age 21 and no father present are entitled to government child support, often they do not get it at all or do not get the full amount. Closely related to the issue of womenтАЩs earnings and benefits in the fact that between 1970 and 1989 the number of women workers of age 16 and above holding multiple jobs increased by almost 400 percent тАФ from 636,000 to more than 3 million. Women who worked more than one job in 1989 were more likely than men to be doing so because the additional earnings were necessary to meet regular household expenses."

Jab girls exactly men jesi ho jyegi so what's the point of 2 genders in this world. It means one of them is useless? being married or be with a girl? There is some natural differences which is beautiful. Don't get brainwashed. Equality is different but being dumb and different just forcefully to prove a point is stupidity. Be yourself how you are naturally.  Pregnant wali bat sari females deti bs ek yahi argument hai unke pas. Toh ap bina men k bache paida karlo. Aur pregnant ho bhi jao toh who will protest you for 9 months pregnancy. You need special protection for 9 months. That's men job. Without his sperm you can't do it. Nature has given roles to each gender. Don't foolishly get brainwahsed by feminism. Both should get equal rights but they have their own limits.

"just being impartial.......i support quiet towards feminism...(for 11:14 )..but id such is hte case......then in the world..if thee are 10 boys and 10 girls.....and its related to men of not being employed...then in that 10 men if 5 men are unmarried....then as per gods eye pov of dynamics does it not look like despite 5 men are unemployes as per orthodox mindset of marrage...does it not look that that remaining 5 women that are are also abt to marry that remaining 5 men....cause there are no male polygamy or in islam style phenomenon is it???....idk but wrt the psyclopsys that comes in......that the women will keep byting the men from inside just cause he is not capable of earning frm inside women will eat......and from outside..men will eat them.precisely if they earn.........(as per orthodox extremistic behaviour)......and hte phylanthrophie also comes of openly speaking.....cause when tried to see as per gods eye vie of dynamics into formal statement....there is a view that then women are ""just"" not getting to speak openly as 7:07 this phrase looks dilute as its just a quote as ""per action"" they r capableof backbitching men as well...as per scatistic its 50-50....or even 60-40 wrt the time spending forcement action ""though men act efficiently"" if they go angry and short minded they they just hit 1 and end it up...but yeah that hitting is intense.....but also there are men who have such mindset with such words when in open...follows
6:15 <- kinda this but in a 7:07 propect when we r in work and all giggle in to earn money and also in the absence in that thaught when such meeting or debate are made

and also how does tha pov of women work as as per what i have ""witnessed""....i have aslo seen 7:25 prospect that u will see in hijab or wearing old traditional wear or even modern wear in the old women mothers to their daughters or other girls or even towarrds themselves...well themselves is fine but when we see men its okish but women even women themselves precisely in high position and their unerlings willingly do it...or even volentarily do such things.....or even as official applicability as per the rule in the office or politics or hoouse or hijab, sarees, or sometimes probably by women principles or university heads


other than feminism and all.....specism is the biggest issue but not serious taken issue at all...and not taken seriously issue cause they themselves to or randamatindentially do it"

""" Unnatural Equality "" 

Selected readings from the QurтАЩan were prepared in English by the English Orientalist, Edward William Lane, and were first published in London in book form in 1843. In his foreword, Lane wrote that тАЬthe fatal point in Islam was the degradation of woman.тАЭ Since then this remark has been regularly taken up as a stick with which to beat Islam. In fact, whenever Islamic affairs were mentioned, it became such a common observation, that not only the enemies of Islam, but also relatively fair-minded writers such as the historian, J.M. Roberts, who did justice to Islam in pointing out its virtues, mentioned it as if it were an established fact. We have shown in detail, at another point in this book, that this allegation is entirely baseless. The facts are quite the reverse. Islam has, in actual fact, raised the status of woman. If the truth were told, womanтАЩs degradation has come about at the hands of two major civilizations, one ancient and polytheistic, the other modern and atheistic. The former has been culpable both in theory and in practice, while the latter has been so in practice, despite itтАЩs theorizing to the contrary. We must never lose sight of the fact that what governed the ethics and lifestyles of ancient polytheistic civilizations were myths. Certain highly fanciful, but obviously baseless suppositions were believed in as truths, and all aspects of human existence were subordinated to them. For instance, ancient man regarded certain natural phenomena, such as the sun and the moon, with the awe of ignorance, and venerated them as deities. Conversely, he supposed certain other phenomena to be inferior, therefore, undeserving of respect. It was into the latter category that women fell, possibly because menstruation and their inability to fight alongside their men folk were interpreted in an adversely superstitious manner. Woman was regarded as the inferior sex and, therefore, deserving of degrading treatment by men. Modern western civilization has hardly produced a better result in ostensibly exalting the status of women. It may have pronounced men and women equal in every respect and decreed that all work that can be done by a man can be done by a woman too: it may have encouraged women to come out of their homes and try to find a position equal to a manтАЩs in every department of life (hence the slogan, тАЬDonтАЩt make coffee, make policyтАЭ); but, in practice, this concept of equality has done more to degrade women than any traditional view could have done. The next chapter deals with this topic in detail. What is the reason then for this state of affairs? The reason, to put it briefly, is the erroneous concept of absolute equality in western countries. For example, equality between men is held to be an indisputable fact. But if this equality between men is taken to mean that in every field every man can compete with every other man, the upholder of such an unnatural concept should be able to take an Einstein to a boxing ring and expect him to put up a good fight against the heavyweight champion. Conversely he would also expect the boxer to be able to hold his own while presiding over international, scientific conferences. This may seem laughable, but that is what absolute equality would mean. The Einstein who was at the top of the list in university or science conferences would be seen as a sadly inferior person in a bout with a boxer and the boxer would be completely out of his depth at the conference table. It is clear that applying this rule of equality would result in disaster. True equality mean equality not in the workplace but in status. Human equality does not mean that every man should be engaged in the same work as everyone else. It means rather that every man should be looked upon with the same respect, and should be able to expect the same treatment, legally and morally. The error into which the West has fallen is its attempt to establish an unnatural equality in the workplace for men and women. The result is as might have been expected: the greatest inequality in human history has developed between men and women. If men and women are of two different sexes, it is because they were created to serve separate purposes. Place them in their respective fields and they will be equally successful, although in different ways. Place both men and women in the same field, and the women will fail to excel: the men will do better due to their natural abilities. As a result, the women will suffer a fall in status vis-├а-vis the men. Inspired by false notions of equality, a certain country girl once fled her home to seek an independent life in a city intending to make money as men do. She failed, however, to find a place in the world of men. What remained at her disposal now was her femininity. This she traded for an independent life. This independent life was not, however, gained by securing тАЬequalityтАЭ in social life; it was gained rather by having condescended to become the plaything of men. Somewhat similar, but on a larger scale, has been the case of western women. The West encouraged women to come out of their homes to earn like men. They did so only to find that it was impossible to have an independent life by working like men in the outside world. The only alternative available to them to making money was their femininity. Like the country girl who fled her home, they had to sell their femininity in the market place. Such unnatural and immoral acts failed to give women an equal status. This resulted rather in the creation of innumerable new problems. One of them is pornography, which is not a separate problem in itself, but the inevitable result of unrestricted freedom having given way to licence."

""" Women in Modern Civilisation "" 

Where modern western man fell deeply into error, was in his blind acceptance of the concept of the equality of the sexes without giving due consideration of what equality тАФ in its best sense -тАФ ought to mean, or what in practice it entails. According to modern thinking, giving equal status to women meant bringing them out of their homes and standing them face to face with men in all facets of life without any regard for the practical and moral problems which might ensue. Islam, on the other hand, defines separate roles, and, therefore, separate spheres of work for men and women, since it is natural and realistic to do so. The other great error made by modern western thinkers was to assume that a role which was separate and different, and played out in other than traditionally masculine strongholds, was necessarily of trifling importance тАФ in short, inferior. As such, the West concluded that in giving a separate role to woman Islam gives them an inferior position. Conversely, since it is held in the West (in theory) that women must be given a place in all masculine spheres it is also concluded that the West gives her a superior position. So modern man imagines that his feminine counterpart has, in actuality, been accorded a superior position. But let us examine what, in fact, is the state of womenтАЩs affairs. In the societies of the West, which have attained a high level of material development, theory has yet to be put into practice, and men and women still live and work in their own very separate domains. The status of women is, in practice, almost the same as it was in ancient times, there still being mutually exclusive divisions into male and female spheres, with the corresponding attitudes still very much in evidence. If this were not so, what need would there be for тАЬwomenтАЩs lib?тАЭ Fourteen hundred years ago, Islam launched a much-needed тАЬwomenтАЩs libтАЭ movement, whose purpose was to free women from artificial curbs, and to give them the position which any normal human being should have in society. (One instance, for example is to give them a share in family property). This movement raised their status without any sacrifice of femininity or traditional values, and without creating any perversion in society. Having launched its movement under the guidance of revelation, its Islamic exponents were in no doubt as to what limits should be set to societal change. The West, however, in its preoccupation with modernity, plunged headlong into experimentation with the old order of values, sweeping away traditional moral precepts and тАЬrestrictiveтАЭ conventions. All of this was done under the banners of тАЬreason,тАЭ тАЬempiricism,тАЭ тАЬlogic,тАЭ тАЬliberalism,тАЭ and so on, but, in actual fact, the whole тАЬliberationтАЭ movement has been swamped in a welter of emotion, creating a number of social problems."

2.
The reason why they don't support matriarch because they saw when a woman become The Ruler (Matriarch )
they become even cruel then (Patriarch ) Male Ruler.*

[* Don't have to believe me. Just Google it.]

3.
When matriarch don't work they come with feminism.  Many people support it(some men). Some thought it is right for woman. They don't know (or they know) to wear shorts , bikini, etc clothes. Many countries research says that the reason rape happened because of female's clothes and po*n. 

And many of us already see what happened in a movie called (Hit : 2nd case) . The so called feminism. 

But I am not supporting the movie called( Animal or any work of Mr.Sandeep). It just a  entertainment.

 ask Google how many male and woman (%) cheat  their  partner.  
And also compare previous years also. And you will see 40% INDIAN woman cheat on their male partner . That means around 4/10 women have affair with other men. And the female feels pleasure doing it. They don't feel any regrets. SHOCKING NEWS 
Up until now if anything happened male is sololy made this Sin now .....




4.
(Both movie tell us current situation in the world.)
( And I don't support Patriarch which tells woman have no right or give male every opportunity. Because in my family even female do job.)

5. 
We believe in equal rights. But that doesn't mean one should wear shorts dress or bikini, dance in club etc. This applies for male too.

6.
I am not saying I am more knowledgeable than Mr.Dhrub . But I can't trust people (American and western) who told  about feminism and say woman have to wear bikini.

""" Women's Status in Islam "" 

In ancient times, thanks to the unreasoning and unreasonable approach fostered by superstition, speculation and other forms of irrational thinking, woman came to be considered inferior, one distressing result of which was that she was deprived, among many other things, of the right to inherit property. She was not even entitled to a share of family property. How great an incapacitating factor this was may be judged from the neglect and degrading treatment which women had to suffer for centuries. It was not until the advent of Islam, that, for the first time in the history of mankind, women were given their due legal rights over property. The famous historian J.M. Roberts writes: Its coming was in many ways revolutionary. It kept women, for example, in an inferior position, but gave them legal rights over property not available to women in many European countries until the nineteenth century. Even the slave had rights and inside the community of the believers there were no castes nor inherited status. This revolution was rooted in a religion which -тАФ like that of the Jews тАФ was not distinct from other sides of life, but embraced them all.5 The same point has been made about ancient India by a retired Chief Justice of the Delhi Court, Mr. Rajindar Sachar: ... Historically, Islam had been very liberal and progressive in granting property rights to women. It is a fact that there were no property rights given to Hindu women until 1956, when the Hindu Code Bill was passed, whereas Islam had granted these rights to Muslim women over 1400 years ago.6 This is not, however, just a matter of anteriority. What is significant is that, in granting women equal status and their proper rights, Islam set up an important precedent which had as far-reaching m effect on the civilization of the times as western civilization has lad on the world of today. If Islam was able to accomplish such an тАШevolution in human affairs, it was because it did not remain just a philosophical creed, but went on to conquer most parts of the inhabited world of the times. In the world of today, even those commentators who generously acknowledge the virtues of Islam often repeat the dictum that Islam has relegated women to an inferior status. But to say that Islam gives women a share in property and then to say at the same time that Islam has degraded women is contradictory. From ancient times till today, the question of inheritance has been the most important social issue, and might well be considered the sole criterion of status in society. Entitling women to have a share in property, contrary to the custom of the time, is a clear proof that Islam had no desire to degrade them. Had this been so, the first demonstration of this desire would have been to deprive them of their share in property, a correct and justifiable practice according to the traditions of the times. It is interesting to see the reverse side of the coin as presented by a recent convert to Islam, namely, the English pop singer, Cat Stevens, now known as Yusuf Islam. Asked by a Jewish woman how he intended to deal with the problem of IslamтАЩs тАЬdegradationтАЭ of women, he said that he had not actually made a study of womenтАЩs status in Islam, but that for his own part, he had, since his conversion, asked his mother to come and stay with him and that he loved looking after her. His relations with his wife had also considerably improved. In its assessment of the status of women, the western mind has made the same error as was made by ancient man: it has formed opinions based on irrational beliefs. This accounts for latter-day distortions of thought regarding women in the advanced western countries and for the resultant grave distortion in the concept of women."

Well u said No femenist supported the girl who slapped a boy and Neha Dhupia. It's true. But they didn't oppose as well. Only boys were opposing them. But if it were a reverse case then feminists would have started barking and boys would also take action against those boys. That's the difference between men and women. The fact is every single women supports a women even if she's wrong. But men don't do the same. And for more Watch Andrew Tate.

"I have one question if anyone here can answer. Let's turn back the clock to the time of hunters-gatherers, when times were tough at that time roles of males and females were fixed Right? What do you think feminism meant then? Let's move a little ahead in history, Agricultural revolution. Most of the farmers were men, doing hard labour in extreme weather. What do you think feminism meant then? Roles were fixed back then also right? Do you think anyone would have raised their voice that women should also get equal work at the farm? Now further ahead in time, Industrial revolution. A little better time, but still livelihood involved working with heavy and dangerous machines. We can safely say feminism had made a slight entry by this time, only a little bit it was there. Now, coming to the modern day world, when earning a living is mostly non dangerous. If you talk about the office jobs. And coincidentally now only we see this feminism movement in full swing. And note that there are still dangerous jobs today also, but equality is demanded only in the places of power, fame and non dangerous jobs. Now why is that? If the whole world is run at the ground level by men, if it's men who are responsible for maintaining and running this entire infrastructure at its core(whether it's sewage, electrical wirings, construction, oil refineries etc etc), then how can there be equality at the top."

"Feminism is not what Men decide- what is the right way for the woman! 
- Gender rights would be realise best interests only if woman don't follow the corporate career life to fit on the lines of Man's world.
- Though they are struggling despite the glass ceiling still just like men earlier- they will take the routes to leave their children, drink & abuse, retreat from the mainstream society... but the thing is Men should not decide their path of equality. That is when, true freedom will be said to occur. 
- Because ""Social Order when spoonfed becomes restriction amd deviance is measured in little things.""
- Indian Society: Caste flexible conservative patriarchial North and caste-rigid, flexible- Patriarchal South. Women face worst kind of life in North India. 
- Only little freedom is enjoyed by poor and the rich women while the Middle class is intensely controlling. Also apart from class, in caste lower caste women enjoy more frredom.
This freedom sociologically is seen in ""free to work"" and ""sexuality""- among the rich and poor households/ lower castes. 
Mainstream intellectual class which is usually middke class would call this disorder but its Not. Middle classes don't count when it comes to women as Sati, parda system has been their forte. Rest of the monetary issues like dowry or child marriage is again the poor man's choice or the rich man's strategic/ buiz/ political relation building."

""" Baneful Effects of Deviation "" 

Any deviation from the divine balance established by God leads to chaos and confusion. It is, therefore, laid down in the QurтАЩan that no changes should be made in the balance God has created by means of His laws of reform.17 One example of universal balance is the fixity of the distance between the sun and earth (about 90 million miles). This distance is extremely balanced, ensuring a whole range of temperatures on earth which is favorable to the continuance of the human species. If this balance were upset in any way, it would result in all kinds of disasters. For instance, if the distance between the sun and the earth were reduced by half, temperatures would rise to such extremes, that everything and everyone on the surface of the earth would be reduced to ashes. There would be no possibility of life existing in any form whatsoever. The same applies to the girth of our planet. Its present circumference is about 25,000 miles, but if this were reduced by half, the pull of its gravity would be so weakened that we should all go flying off into space. If, on the contrary, the circumference were doubled, the effect of gravity would be so overwhelming that all growth would cease. Man would be reduced to the size of a mouse and a mouse would be little bigger than an ant. The unparalleled balance that exists on earth is aptly illustrated by the strange example of the insects which, unlike human beings, do not possess lungs, but breathe through tubes. When insects grow large the tubes cannot grow in ratio to the increasing size of the body of the insect. Hence there never has been an insect more than a few inches long with a slightly longer wing spread. Because of the mechanism of their structure and their method of breathing, there never could be an insect of great size. This limit in their growth held all insects in check and prevented them from dominating the world. If this physical check had not been provided, man could not exist. Imagine a man meeting a hornet as big as a lion or a spider equally large.18 Of course, the notion of order in the world has periodically been called into question. A certain western writer has suggested that the gravitational pull of the earth is far greater than is absolutely essential, hence the difficulty one experiences in carrying even a weight of ten kilos. Had it been less, he points out; we should have been able to walk about, carrying a weight with ease. But this objection is ill-founded. It is entirely due to gravity having the pull that it does, that our homes remain firmly fixed to the ground. Had it been less, they would have flown about like kites, and civilization, as we know it would hardly have been possible. It is fortunate that the order of the universe is not in the hands of men. If it were, we should experience intermittent tampering with the immutable laws of nature. Gravity would wax and wane, the earth would move nearer to or further from the sun and, on the pretext that nature had been cruel to insects in fixing the size of their breathing tubes, the said creatures would be encouraged to grow to elephantine proportions, thus filling the whole earth with them. None of these developments would, however, be encouraging to the human species! Luckily, man cannot effect such changes in the universe, since he has no power over its ordering. But he is free to act as he wills in his own world, and the result has been chaos on a grand scale. The extremes to which he has gone are thus referred to in the QurтАЩan: тАЬEvil appears on land and sea as a result of the (evil) which menтАЩs hands have done.тАЭ"

""" Law of Balance ""

Now let us examine this divine law. In the words of the QurтАЩan it is the law of balance: тАЬHe raised the heaven on high and set the balance that you might not transgress the balance. Give just weight and full measure.тАЭ15 The universe is not composed of just one item. It is rather a collection of highly disparate elements. Besides this, each and every one of its components is in motion. Not a single constituent, from the minutest atom to the most gigantic galaxy, can ever for a second remain static. For the precise functioning of this infinitely complex assemblage of moving components, limits in space and time had to be applied so that the different parts did not come into conflict with each other. God, therefore тАФ besides creating all these things тАФ established a systematic balance between them. This principle is known as the тАЬLaw of Nature.тАЭ Similarly, in the human world тАФ also a vast assemblage of disparate individuals тАФ everyone is in motion. And in order that each should continue on his lifeтАЩs journey without colliding with his fellow men, it was likewise necessary to establish boundaries, both moral and physical, for all human beings without exception: a balance had to be struck so that there should be no clash between individuals or societies. It is, indeed, this law of nature which has been revealed to humanity through the medium of the prophets. GodтАЩs will on this subject is recorded in the QurтАЩan: тАЬWe have sent our Messengers with clear signs and brought down with them scriptures and the scales of justice so that men might deal with fairness.тАЭ16 That is to say that God sent a balance of justice in the form of a book through His prophets. This book was supported by arguments and evidence so that people could believe in its authenticity and would not hesitate to order their lives according to this balance, that is, the just law. While the law of balance is inherent in the rest of creation, for man, it has been provided externally through the revelations of this divine book."

""" ORDER OF NATURE ""

Sculpture is an ancient form of art. There is, no doubt, an obvious resemblance between living beings and statues, but if someone were to presume that the concerns of human beings were the same as those of statues and began to study man under the heading of sculpture, what would be the outcome? This method of study would certainly lead to strange conclusions. A carved image has no need of food and drink; therefore, the student of sculpture would naturally assume that arrangements to this effect were not necessary for man either. He would proceed to the assumption that if a statue can be locked inside a room for any length of time, so could a man be put inside a locked room for years without anyone having to worry about him. During the time of the former President of Egypt, Jamal Abdun Nasir, an ancient statue of Abu Simbel, 20 meters high and firmly fixed in the rocks, had to be removed from its place to make way for the construction of a huge dam. This work, undertaken between 1964 and 1966, necessitated the use of special machines which could cut the statue into several pieces so that they could be shifted to a safer place, and then reassembled. Now, on this parallel, the student who views man as a statue, can also, as part of some scheme, start chopping up the human body. Of course, there is no sculptor in this world who would do such a thing. But in another department, that of education, such experts have come into being in modern times as are experimenting with man as if he were a statue, and doing everything to him that could be done to a statue. This branch of knowledge is called тАЬanthropology.тАЭ This field of study began at the turn of the 19th century. In the light of data collected on external information regarding the conditions of ancient man, his beliefs, customs, traditions, certain conclusions about human beings in general were arrived at. Religion naturally came within this field of study, necessitating the collection of information on the religions practised by different tribes and communities. Thus a list of the customs which went under the name of religion was produced. A natural outcome of this method of study was that religion came to be regarded as a social phenomenon. That is to say, religion was presented as something which had evolved out of the influences of human myths, customs and social conditions. Religion is essentially a divine truth (a commandment of God), but thanks to the anthropologistsтАЩ particular method of study, it has been reduced to a mere artifact of historical accretion. The greatest harm done to religion by this method of study is that in modern times it has been shorn of its credibility, and reduced to insignificance, whereas, as the commandment of GodтАЩs religion it had an unassailable authenticity, because it possessed divine credibility in its own right. Every religious statement was accepted as the ultimate statement of a superior being and, as such, worthy of being adhered to. Conversely, when religion is regarded merely as a social phenomenon, all its credibility is dissipated. This can be compared to relegating the science of chemistry to the position of alchemy, or to equating astronomy with astrology. The fact is that this method of study, when applied to religion, is totally wrong. It turns a reality into a non-reality. It is to accord human status to something which is essentially divine. To understand the reality of religion let us peruse this verse of the QurтАЩan: тАЬAre they seeking a religion other than GodтАЩs when every soul in heaven and earth has submitted to Him, willingly or by compulsion? To Him they shall all return.тАЭ14 According to this verse, the religion which God desires man to adopt in his daily living is the same divine law which God has imposed upon the entire universe. Religion is the name of this same universal law."

"This is in need of the hour, I think everyone should understand equal rights and respect individual thoughts.

"Core arguments of pseudo feminism aren't unaddressed here.
Secondly, emphasis should be on equal treatment, rights, opportunities as well as reservation for women in certain areas, not on equality between men and women in an absolute sense. If equal opportunities provided, they may perform even better than men, then why the fuss of absolute equality!
Thirdly, the mentioned web series, unrelated to feminism; affirmed here. Offcourse they do not promote feminism instead they are creating a different notion or let's say a negative notion of feminism in the society, and that was unaddressed too."
"And most important thing and disturbing also for me that when a woman speaks worse about woman , i can't expect anything from a sigma man but when a woman says these things that she wants to marry a rich guy and don't want to do a job ,i just hate this cause so many people are giving their support to women but they themselves don't want to be independent and thats sad"

I would like you request you about make video on extremely antimen BNS69 , fake dowry cases, fake rape cases...where sadistic women use law as weapon to torture men and his whole family.
unfortunately 80% of these cases are Fake (courts also admitted this) many men have left with no option but to end his life.ЁЯдР

this government and judiciary is working to completely Destroy marriage institutions
and men's life.ЁЯе┤
if woman caught having extra marital affair husband still have to pay maintenance to her after divorce....WTH is this?
there are many flow in laws.

there are many influencers now spreading awareness on this issue.
please join this movement!!!"
Then why the reservation is only for specific communities. ..even they are all similar as keep to body as keep to structure. Mind and awareness is the biggest difference here ..as I experienced man is more sensitive as compare to women's.

"Bro every responsible citizen would always agree with these ideologies but I quit disagree with your example of Gautam Buddha if someone is abusing you and you are not saying anything in response then  you are facing injustice.Also it has became almost impossible to survive in today's world while following such IDEAL thoughts. I think that if I were at that place, I would have atleast spoken that it was the other one's fault not due to my patriarchal ideology but due to my tendency to avoid any wrong with me

"Dhruv you are talking about definition more than the reality. Feminism is great but now it is not at all about equal rights. Most of them are Men haters who thinks drinking alcohol, abusing and roaming without clothes empowers woman.

Tell me a single right that a male has but a female doesn't. There isn't any! So what are they fighting for? We already have equal rights and opportunities. The only thing needed is strict law to protect men and women from discrimination."
Hi @dhruv can you also make video on fake dowry cases and fake domestic violence cases. How female misuse the law to gain unfair benefits
Pray we have more Dhruv Rathi in societies we live тЭд

Coz acc to their logic they're are putting effort in relationship just by bring money.. Meanwhile clearly discrediting the work of a housewife.

"I really had high hopes from your video even you started by saying you are going to talk about issues men are suffering with, but I was disappointed. 
The problem is you have started to be influenced by the section of people who tend to troll you on social media and make video just to respond to them. But there is large section of society that does critical thinking and has real issues that you fail to address.
And a big point to be noted is that when wrong things are doing in the context to a potential right movement, the entire movement gets defamed and so is the case with Women empowerment and Feminism. 
The thought process associated to this movement is ruining huge number of lives because of its misuse. I dare you make videos about real issues is men in the society because of one sided laws and their misuse."

I came across a debate once, between the differences of men and women and one side proclaimed, ""Aurton ke haath se khana achcha banta hai, usme nature ka role hai. Vo aadmiyon se jyada achcha khana bana leti hai. Isme ham kya kar sakte hain.""

"Problem is not in feminism. 
But today, girls who potray themselves as feminist actually supports matriarchy. 
Campaigns like 'kill all men' , 'we dont need men' , 'all mens are pig', mens falsely getting abused, bitch files fake rape case against a men to satisfy her ego and destroy a mens career and his reputation in the society is acceptable by the law. 
I do support him in his previous but this time, i think if you want equal rights, then equalism is a better word. 

I read a line in class 10th history chapter 1 (may be) which concludes that 'nationalism leads to imperialism'. 
Can't the same thing be applied to feminism? 
I think i dont support feminism because 'feminism leads to matriarchy'. 
Equalism is a better word.
I am an equalist not a feminist."
"A thing happened with me. A woman around 55 years was travelling with me in auto rickshaw. After some time she started putting allegation on me that I was misbehaving with her.

Edit : If this is not harassment then what's this."

When feminists preach about equality then they should also take equal responsibilities like a man. Feminism talk about their rights when only it comes to corporate world but when it comes to hard labour feminism disappears. Men and Women are different by nature they should rather complement each other not compete with each other. Modern day feminism is nothing but toxic wokeism.
"What about Corporate ?
Why Inequality still exists there 

Women can come to office in Sleeveless, Short Skirts  ,Frocks , Jumpsuits and Heels..
But Men have to come in Shirt & Pant only ? 
Why we aren't men's allowed to wear Slippers ,Boxers or Barmoda ??? 
I don't see any Group of Male demanding equality ЁЯдФ in this Dresscode BS

And that's why Men > Women"
"тАЬHIGHLY EDUCATEDтАЭ DHRUV RATHI DOESNтАЩT UNDERSTAND SOME SIMPLE FACTS SO LETS ENLIGHTEN HIM:

1). MEN AND WOMEN ARE DESIGNED BY GOD FOR DIFFERENT ROLES IN THE SOCIETY. 

2). MEN HAVE 20 TIMES MORE TESTOSTERONE THAN WOMEN WHICH INDICATE MEN ARE PROTECTORS AND PROVIDERS. TO PROVIDE AND PROTECT MEN NEED TO GO OUT IN THE WORLD TO BRING BACK RESOURCES FOR THE FAMILY.

3). WOMEN ARE MORE EMOTIONAL, MEN ARE MORE RATIONAL AND LOGICAL (THESE ARE HARD BIOLOGICAL FACTS) WHICH INDICATE WOMEN BELONG AT HOME FOR NURTURING AND TAKING CARE OF HOME AND FAMILY. AND MEN BELONG OUTSIDE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS/DO BUSINESS/ADD VALUE IN THE SOCIETY.

4). AS THE SOCIETY IS тАЬPROGRESSINGтАЭ IN THE NAME OF MODERNISM AND FEMINISM, DIVORCE RATES, SUICIDE RATES FOR MEN AFTER MARRIAGE, HOOK UP CULTURE, IS RISING AT AN EXPONENTIAL RATE INDICATING FALL OF SOCIETY. 

5). WHEN A MAN MAKES MONEY, HE THINK OF PROVIDING BETTER FOR HIS FAMILY, WHEN A WOMAN MAKES MONEY, SHE THINKS SHE DOESNтАЩT NEED A MAN. 

6). WHEN WOMEN ARE GIVEN SEXUAL LIBERTY BEFORE MARRIAGE, THEY SLEEP WITH MULTIPLE MEN BEFORE MARRIAGE AND LOSE THEIR ABILITY TO PAIR BOND WITH THEIR HUSBAND, MAKING THE MARRIAGE MORE DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN. ITтАЩS NOT SAME FOR MEN. MEN DONтАЩT GET EASY ACCESS TO SEX. THEY HAVE TO WORK HARD TO BECOME VALUABLE TO ATTAIN SEX FROM WOMEN. THEREFORE SEX COMES HARD TO MEN AND WHAT COMES HARD IS RESPECTED. ON CONTRARY, SEX COMES EASY TO WOMEN AS WOMEN HAVE VALUE JUST BY EXISTING. WHAT COMES EASY ISNтАЩT RESPECTED. 
WOMEN JUST HAVE TO PRESERVE THEIR VALUE BY BEING CHAST UNTIL MARRIAGE. 

7). MEN AND WOMEN ARE NOT EQUAL. MEN LOVE SELFLESSLY . WOMEN LOVE ON CONDITIONS. 

8). WOMEN ARE HYPERGAMOUS CREATURES- THEY LOOK FOR A MAN MORE TALLER, STRONGER, SMARTER, AMBITIOUS, AFFLUENT, DECISIVE THAN THEM.  MEN ON THE OTHER HAND CAN EASILY DATE DOWN. A RICH AND FAMOUS MAN CAN MARRY A POOR WOMAN WORKING AT MCDONALDs. A RICH AND FAMOUS WOMAN WILL NEVER MARRY A BROKE MAN. RONALDO MARRIED A POOR WAITRESS FROM A RESTAURANT AND MADE HER A QUEEN. 

9). PICK UP ANY RELIGIOUS TEXT BOOK AND YOUтАЩLL FIND EXCERPTS REFERRING TO WOMEN BELONGING TO HOME AND MEN BELONGING TO THE OUTER WORLD. THIS IS NOT PATRIARCHY. THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE WAY OF LIFE, AND RELATIONSHIPS AND MARRIAGES WERE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL BACK IN TIMES WHEN WOMEN ACCEPTED THAT THE MAN IS THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY AND WILL LEAD THE FAMILY.

10). FEMINISM IS THE REAL CANCER. ITS DECAYING AND DESTROYING THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY. ITS DESTROYING MARRIAGE AS A CONCEPT. TOMORROW WOMEN WILL START PROTESTING AGAINST GOING TO THEIR HUSBANDтАЩS HOME AFTER MARRIAGE. CURRENT DIVORCE RATE IN THE USA IS 50%. JUST IMAGINE OUT OF EVERY 100 MARRIAGES, 50 ARE ENDING UP IN DIVORCE. AND 80% OF THESE DIVORCES ARE BEING INITIATED BY WOMEN. INDIA IS CATCHING UP TO THAT TREND VERY FAST. 

THIS IS WHAT THESE тАЬEQUAL RIGHTS FEMINISTSтАЭ ARE DOING TO OUR GENERATION. INTERNET, SOCIAL MEDIA AND MODERN PARENTING ARE RUINING WOMEN OF TODAY."

"Sir , yaa apna kaha ki aurat kitni baar thana sunti ha, par apna ya nahi kaha  ki 
Hamari society unaa bagwan ka rupake manthi haa, joo Jevan deti haa,joo kushiya deti haa 

Sir everything has negative and positive please look on that and convience your opinion
If you agree like--------->"
Your video is absolutely correct but then again you have targeted our religion.. You showed a reference from garud puran.. But what about women's right in islam.. Where they are strictly told to cover their whole body and have 0 freedom?
this is a serious issue nowadays. Indian culture is ruined day by day.  we just adopt Western culture day by day. no one can differentiate what is right and what is wrong.
I love you druv true content most people (alpha male ) cant digest the fact that how can this kind of video he will make .... I am a feminist to all my sisters here never give up on your fundamental rights

"Mostly feminism is opposed by women herself. Most of the women are tailing some toxic masochistic male for their attention disregarding their self respect. Everyone has a choice, everyone has their freedom. You don't need to spread lectures for feminism or patriarchy it is just drama. Actually reality is education is important. Even after being fully educated someone choose patriarchy then who are you to oppose or criticize their choice."

24:00 from here i agree that many people pointed out as feminism but instead if we look at it broadly the girl wasnt arrested or didnt got any serious charges and if the genders would be opposite the male would be under huge aligations so i think many females and govt. too have taken feminism as matriarchy and thus these days female dominance is growing in many different ways

Pleased to understand FEMINISM 
"The problem is deeper actually, there are many qualities that are characterized as feminine and masculine.. compassion is believed to be a feminine quality... like why? .. A man can not be compassionate? Aggression is described as a masculine quality... like why? That is why i love the concept of 10 Mahavidyas and 10 Bhairavas... all the qualities possessed by a human are expressed both in masculine and feminine forms.. of course, the stories still have patriarchal elements in them, but it's a good start from where you can start destroying patriarchy within you..."

""" THE WILLINGNESS OF WOMEN ""

The presence of a greater number of women in a society is not the only prerequisite for polygamy. It is, in addition, compulsory that the woman who is the object of the manтАЩs choice should be willing to enter into the married state. This willingness on the womanтАЩs part is a must before a marriage can be lawful in Islam. It is unlawful to marry a woman by force. There is no example in the history of Islam where a man has been allowed to force a woman into marriage. The Prophet MuhammadтАЩs own view that тАЬan unmarried girl should not be married until her permission has been takenтАЭ6 had been recorded by both Bukhari and Muslim. тАШAbdullah ibn тАШAbbas, one of the ProphetтАЩs Companions and a commentator on the QurтАЩan, narrates the story of a girl who came to the Prophet complaining that her father had her married off against her wishes. The Prophet gave her the choice of either remaining within the bonds of wedlock or of freeing herself from them.7 Another such incident narrated by тАШAbdullah ibn тАШAbbas concerns a woman called Burairah and her husband, Mughith, who was a black slave. тАШAbdullah ibn тАШAbbas tells the story as if it were all happening before his very eyes: тАЬMughith is following Burairah through the paths of Medina. He is crying and his tears are running down his beard. Seeing him, the Prophet said to me, тАШO тАШAbbas, are you not surprised at MughithтАЩs love for Burairah and BurairahтАЩs hate for Mughith?тАЩ Then the Prophet said to Burairah, тАШI wish you would take him back.тАЩ Burairah said to the Prophet, тАШIs that a command?тАЩ The Prophet replied, тАШNo, it is only a recommendation.тАЩ Then Burairah said, тАШI donтАЩt need your recommendation.тАЩтАЭ8 There was an interesting case of polygamy which took place during the Caliphate of тАШUmar ibn al-Khattab. A certain widow, Umm Aban bint тАШUtbah had four suitors for marriage. All four тАФ тАШUmar ibn al-Khattab, тАШAli ibn abi Talib, Zubayr and Talhah тАФ were already married. Umm Aban accepted the proposal of marriage made by Talhah and, of course, refused the other three, whereupon she was married to Talhah.9 This happened in Medina, the capital of the Islamic State. Among the rejected suitors was the reigning Caliph. But no one expressed even surprise or dismay, the reason being that in Islam, a woman is completely free to make her own decisions. This is a right that no one can take away from her-тАФ not even the ruler of the day. These incidents show that the Islamic commandments giving permission to marry up to four women does not mean having the right to seize four women and shut them up inside oneтАЩs home. Marriage is a matter of mutual consent. Only that woman can be made a second or a third wife who is willing to be so. And when this matter rests wholly on the willingness of the woman, there is no cause for objection. The present age gives great importance to freedom of choice. This value is fully supported by Islamic law. On the other hand, the upholders of тАЬfeminismтАЭ want to turn freedom of choice into restriction of choice."

"THESE DAYS BOYS ARE USING ALPHA AND SIGMA . DR IS SAYING RIGHT. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS,THEY AREN'T BEING GIRL,MEANS WESTERN INFLUENCE IS FU*CKING INDIAN SOCIETY. FEMENISM SHOULD BE PROMOTED BUT WESTERN INFLUENCE HAS MADE GIRLS OF THESE DAYS OF UPPER CLASS (their behaviour) TO HANDLE AND PORTRAY A MASCULINE CHARACTER BOYS DO ALPHA ."
"I think women in India are much ahead in terms of equal rights than western countries, here's why - 
1. Many Hindu Gods are women
2. Our 2 main mythology stories are around the dignity of women.
3. Shivaji maharaj where created any built by there mother - Jijau mata. (In 1600)
4. We had tararani Bai (from Kolhapur) who fought against Mughals. ( 1700s)
5. We have Jhasi ki rani, who fought in war (1800)
6. We have Savitribai phule, for made school for girls ( 1800)
7. India had women prime minister - Indira Gandhi for 8-9 years, and 2 women presidents - Pratibha Patil and drapati Marmo.

All above shows that India has always valued women, from very past till present.

Whereas compared to Western countries, there is no History of women fighting in war. US did not had a single women President so far. 

Overall, India should have support for women in terms of equal rights, but western countries need more feminism than Indians."
ЁЯСП ye hui na baat
"Almost in all physically intensive jobs men are looked upon. Why no females fighting against ememies in army, air force and navy in life threatening situations? I would say the govt should start include atleast 50% women in all govt positions, including government and parliament. Then include them in critical army operations. This will truly impart equality."
What rights do men have that women don't ЁЯдФ
"Hi Dhruv, I have seen many women related videos. Still I am confused. I want your opinion.
1. Boy=asset, women=liability. The problem here is women must have to take rest during the baby process like pregnancy, birth, feeding. After that she might leave her job. Solution?
2. Why husbands are not ready to move into their wife's house, why men can't handle house work and wife handles office work only. Also if both are going to work then at the end i think they are giving less time to their children. Can one of them be with children alternately?"

"We men are not against feminism . we are against the women who do not use the rights properly or misuse them . 
Making fictitious accusations of physical or psychological abuse, trying to make money, or getting a leg up in divorce and custody disputes are many of the reason some men dislike feminism.
While it is important to help and defend sexual assault victims, there have also been cases of false rape accusations.
I hope one day everyone will understand this and your video is a good example of it ."
Thanks Sir for your time
Sir ur video is fine . But u shouldn't discriminate b/w a black and a white man .
"Regardless of all the comments praising him for being equal and what not.
Feminism is a real mind consciousness cancer spreading in society and labelling anyone speaking up against it as ""chapri"" just goes to show how little counter arguments they have thus resorting to such name calling
If this side is chapriya then it's not incorrect to call the other side randiya"
"Problem is not in feminism. 
But today, girls who potray themselves as feminist actually supports matriarchy. 
Campaigns like 'kill all men' , 'we dont need men' , 'all mens are pig', mens falsely getting abused, bitch files fake rape case against a men to satisfy her ego and destroy a mens career and his reputation in the society is acceptable by the law. 
I do support dhruv but this time, i proudly say i am 'equalist' and not a 'feminist'. 

I read a line in class 10th history chapter 1 (may be) which concluds that 'nationalism leads to imperialism'. 
Can't the same thing be applied to feminism? 
I think i dont support feminism because 'feminism leads to matriarchy'. 
Equalism is a better word."

Frank Borman, an American astronaut went into space with a woman astronaut in the same spacecraft. After his return from the voyage he said: тАЬHaving women on the spacecraft was okay except that it would be upsetting to put a male and a female too close together for a long time.тАЭ BormanтАЩs comment certainly upset the feminists. One American lady remarked in the course of a fiery speech: тАЬMr. Frank Borman would never have existed had his parents not come together.тАЭ Scientific research together with the realities of practical life has shocked the cherished concepts of feminists leading some of them to rethink their ideals. An American lady, Mrs. Marabel Morgan, a mother of two, recently published a book entitled Total Woman. Here is the simple magic formula she divulged to her American sisters so that they may lead successful married lives. тАЬBe nice to your husband, stop nagging him and understand his needs.тАЭ In less than a year this book sold three million copies. To the writer the perfection of womanhood lies in her ability to become a good companion of her husband rather than seek an independent life.31 The truth is that the total woman is one who can be a total companion to her husband."

"I feel this video was not properly explained Dhruv. I understand Feminism and equal opportunity but I don't quite agree with Patriarchy. Because Patriarchy has  changed a lot in centuries and in 21st Century there girls getting more opportunity, income and equal recognition. If People want to smash the Patriarch, why are Men still held accountable for Alimony post divorce even when wife's got a great Job. Or custodial bias in  child custody case. You see Men and women have different roles in the society and most women in relationship  prefer to be with men who are wealthy and look after their needs. A women who's poor may end up getting married to Financially secure Man. But you'll never see in society a women marrying a broke guy. Because sadly that's how society works. Men spend more money on women than women spending on a Man. Women benefit From modern day Patriarchy. ""Modern-day patriarchy perpetuates inequality against men and rewards women"""

"you need to speak to Neil DeGrasse about men and violence, it is not so easy to make such arguments based only on society structure and norms but it is how Men, hormones and the same organs function differently. Men suffer more in some cases in diseases and women more in others. Both bodies are trully different. Good video but could have been better with more info and some statements like not agreeing with Nina gupta is unfortunate but it is scientifically impossible to agree with your opinion.
Alpha males are all on social media which is the real toxic cause of issues with society  and not movies. 

Nice face saving done by including toxic feminist and trying to justify you created a video on criticising Animal and not them, but even Salman Khan and Ranbir have said the same things these are films and they absolutely hate the characters and do not promote these characters. 

Make a podcast with Neil, that would be better for this subject."

"I never would have imagined you would so dumb and foolish. You quoted Buddah but you have no clue about his teachings or modern day pyschology and neurochemistry. The reality of existence is mind not a physical body, and one's thinking process would define their reality and existence. Testesterone and Astrogen are 2 different neurochemical and transmitters, I hope you would know which chemical influnce which gender. Oh i remember, you are so illiterate that I think I should educate you a little. Testesterone influnce male pyschology and induce traits, qualities and characteristics like aggresive behaviour when threaten, risk taking capabilities, excitement toward challenges, domination when meet peer competition and make the mind to use rational over emotions. Where as astrogen is the chemical that influence women physcology induce traits like emotional thinking process, emotional understanding and bonding, submissive behvaiour especial during intercourse. When the reality and identity of female and male mind is totally different, one is working on rational and one is working on emotions. Then how could you construct the arguments using your bogus hypothetical examples from your mind and forged media to convince millions of people with out any solid evidence that you have understood feminism and now you are here to teach others? Man give me a break! I laugh at your foolishness, and 90% of female are happy being the actual female, they do not want to compete with men. Where as 10% of women with some kind of mental disorder are opting gender equality and men like you which are also very minute percentage among men are defending them. So 10% female population and very little numbers of men with mental disorders like you should marry each other live a happy life, instead of preaching this hypthatical examples and your fithy opinions. And btw Dhruv, I see all of your videos and you are making shit out of evey good subject and topic due to lack of knowledge. 
Btw do you own chatgpt course yourself. Get help from chatgpt and educate yourself in understanding the actual difference between men and women, its not just 3 organs, its  a whole different identity, reality and thinking process."

This would be within the law too, so do you think there should be reservation in corporate sector too for women and how would it be managed in such a big country and does any have enough skilled women for the skilled resources or this plan would be a whole big mess?"

"I donot agree with you. I will heed the wisdom of personalities like Professor Jordan Peterson and Author Robert Greene, acknowledging that differences between genders are inherent in nature, just as differences exist within social hierarchies. Embracing these gender differences is essential, recognizing that each gender has unique strengths and roles. Just as no man can replace a motherтАЩs nurturing role during a childтАЩs critical period of life, similarly, no woman can replace menтАЩs roles requiring physical endurance in extreme occupations like the military, mining, construction, firefighting, and others. True happiness comes from supporting each other rather than competing against gender counterparts to uphold certain ideologies at the expense of happiness."

"WHITHER WOMEN'S LIBS ?

From the 12th to the 16th of January, 1987, a conference was held in Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi, in which philosophers, scientists, writers and artists from 15 countries participated. This five-day conference was arranged by the Government of India on the topic, тАЬTowards New Beginnings.тАЭ Many distinguished ladies of the western world, who have now grown old, were among those who participated. They had spent all their lives working for WomenтАЩs Lib, but their mood was one of frustration. The Indian Express cites Germaine Greer of Australia as a case in point: They are feminists of different hues тАФ Ms. Germaine Greer, the outspoken, aggressive writer from Australia, and Ms. Gisele Halimi, a Tunisian-born lawyer who spearheaded the womenтАЩs movement in France along with Simone de Beauvoir and others. But both voice a concern that is troubling feminists in the West today тАФ Whither womenтАЩs lib? Ms. Greer seems more mellow today: the fire that raged in The Female Eunuch is strangely missing. тАЬThe movement has solved some problems and left us with a different set of problems,тАЭ exclaimed Ms. Greer. тАЬPerhaps the problem was that we didnтАЩt take our mothers with us. We left them behind, found them antiquated. And now that many of us are mothers ourselves with teenaged daughters, perhaps we understand our mothers better.тАЭ2 тАЬThe West has no answers to the problems of inequality between sexes,тАЭ says the internationally acclaimed writer Germaine Greer. The erroneous belief of western women that the females in veils are unequal and the ones with make-up minus the head-cover are free and liberated has to be rejected. Referring to the prevalence of тАЬwife-beatingтАЭ even in the so-called civilized West, she asks, how about the unequal treatment meted out to females in the U.S. and England in the areas of wages and jobs? Well, one-fourth of the crimes in England emanate from violence against women. The man-woman relationship understood in the West as an extension of role-models is the primary cause of strain in the sexual relationships. All the western women identify themselves with the bahu тАФ the bride тАФ forgetting that the mother-in-law and the sister-in-law are also the specific role models to be played by females. She feels that child bearing for a woman is a unique investment: тАЬThe joys of motherhood fill the blanks that cannot be satiated in the specific husband-wife role models.тАЭ Known for her non-conformist and non-traditional views, Ms. Greer advocates тАЬcoitus interruptusтАЭ in the area of birth-control: тАЬThe array of occlusive devices, spermicidal creams, quinine pessaries, douches, syringes, abortifacient pills and rubber goods of all shapes and sizes are the ill-effects of a growing consumer-culture. These have achieved nothing but added strain in the sexual relationships.тАЭ3 Ms. Halimi, is more frank. тАЬIt is a bad time for the womenтАЩs movementтАЭ she admitted. тАЬIt is down at the moment and we are trying to find the reasons for it. Perhaps we got everything women wanted too fast тАФ contraception, abortion, and divorce. And the problems that face women today are not strong enough to give the movement new force and strength.тАЭ Women have very specific values and morals. тАЬThey have a different view of humanity. I am not saying that it is better than that of men, but it is different. And women have to prove that they are women, and not men,тАЭ she emphasized.4 According to religious teaching, the womanтАЩs тАЬrole modelтАЭ was that of mother and housekeeper. She was meant to bear and rear children, and manages the home. The modern role model is that of the busy woman executive, functioning on an equal footing with men in every sphere of the professional world. Years of experiment have shown that the latter role is unrealistic. In their old age, the same western women, who had fervently advocated the new role model, are the very ones who are now asking for a return to the status quo ante. Does this leave any room for doubt about the superiority of the role model postulated by religion?"

This is an ideal explanation of feminism but the fact is that first the feminist should be taught what feminism stands for as what we have been seeing mostly are uneducated people spreading non sense. Patriarchy is a bad thing for both men and women the sooner we realise that the better. It is not about hating the other gender which is completely useless. The society needs both men and women to function and both genders have their traditional roles and thats a fact.

"Feminism is nowadays has turned into matriarchy . Feminists now want special rights not equal rights. 

If you want equal rights , you have to take equal responsibilities too. Druv you have explained true feminism which I agree with . But the reality now is feminism is breaking down the family system . I would say if a woman go outside to earn money when males of the family are capable of earning, how would the child grow up with proper morality and teachings. What is the benefit of being educated when you donтАЩt  educate your own child rather leave them to the illiterate women to teach them ? Men and women have the different roles for a heathy society . The should take thier own responsibility. But obviously discrimination between men and women should not allowed to be established in the society . That's what I think . If you donтАЩt like it you can ignore it. 

One more thing -
There were no feminist in world war 2  ."

"Indian law men and women, explain your thoughts. Then you realised, what is the problem of feminist."
"I agree with most of the points but there are certain points which may need attention.

1. POSH in corporates... totally against men.
2. In divorces cases - Alumni and child support definitely law is in favour of women. 
3. Eve teasing - only men become victim.
4. Women need equal pay in work place but at the same time ask for every privilege possible for women - yup, I am talking about maternity leave. If a women gets pregnant, and needs time off, so does a husband to take care of his wife during this period.
5. Women wants to roam freely at night - definitely yes. But, should take a man along for protection. This world is not safe for anyone, but in many of the cases women have higher chances of being victim than  a man. 
5. If equal opportunities are given to women, then it should be applicable in every field of work. Even in fields like Oil Rigs, fire fighter services, construction etc. Not just the AC cabinet jobs.

Over all the video was informative and good but should have addressed these points too."

I think movies plays a considerable role in developing patriarchal mindset in young/teenage population indirectly. To solve this issue movies which shows faminist society can help a lot becoz we try to behave like them as aspiration.

Reality of Druv Rathee?
""" TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES ""

Plain Truth, a well-known American magazine with a world-wide circulation of 7,850,000, published an article entitled тАШTeen PregnancyтАЩ along with a photograph of Sally, an American teenager. The article included a letter written by Sally, which, though short, is painful and shocking:  When I was 8 years old I first had sex with a boy of 15. I did it because I lack love and attention from my parents. I need love, and my parents never show me any. Nothing really changed at home, and at 15 I became pregnant. My boy friend blamed me and left. I had nowhere to turn, I was trapped, so I had an abortion. Now IтАЩm afraid to date anyone, and I cry myself to sleep every night.5 тАЬFor every 1000 girls between 15 and 19 in America,тАЭ wrote New York correspondent George Gorden, тАЬ96 of them are pregnant.тАЭ6 Such are the tragic consequences of deviation from nature. This is the result of deliberately ignoring the fact that when God created men and women, He laid down rules for their relationship with each other: on reaching a sufficiently mature stage of development, they were to marry, have children and, by a process of mutual co-operation, make a home in which to bring up those children, thus providing a stable base for the progress of mankind. But western modernity became so preoccupied with the concept of freedom that it dispensed with the kind of bonds which held men and women together in a healthy family relationship. The resulting disregard for the institution of marriage gave birth to various kinds of evils in western society, as may be judged from the above-mentioned examples. The free mixing of men and women, with the sexual liberation it implies, is wholly against nature. In matters of sex, a woman prefers a single partner. It is in her nature to love only one man faithfully. Men, on the other hand, are promiscuous by nature. In a situation, therefore, where freedom of sexual relationships is damaging to faithful sexual partnerships, it is the women who suffer psychologically. Emotionally, they have to pay a very high price for their emancipation. The famous Australian feminist, Ms. Germaine Greer, has acknowledged, now that she is of a more mature age, that her zeal for the sexual liberation movement in her youth was not realistic. In an interview with the Indian Express she lamented over the present state of affairs: тАЬWhat is worrying today is the results of the sexual liberation movement -тАФ the number of teenaged girls who have been on the pill since they were 12 and 13, the number of teenaged girls who get pregnant by the time they are 15 and 16. What is happening to them? Sex means something quite different for men. They can love and leave. When the time comes to go to university, they can take off quite easily. Women have a different sensibility. They love with their heads, hearts and loins. And a broken love affair leaves them quite shattered. I have seen it happen to people close to me. And it is terrible.тАЭ7 In modern times Muslim society has fallen prey to many evils, but the reasons for this having happened are different in respect of the West and Islamic civilizations. In the case of the latter, it is deviation from Islamic principles which has caused the rot to set in, whereas in the former case, it is adherence to a new set of man-made principles which has had so deleterious an effect."

"Chhapris are a caste-oppressed community of people who made or mended chhappars, temporary roofs. This was the only job they were allowed to do because of their caste, which was assigned to them by the accident of birth. However, the word has in recent years become a pejorative for someone who tries hard to be flamboyant. Looking blingy and flashy has been a form of expression and assertion by historically oppressed castes when they manage to earn enough money, but upper castes have looked down on such transformations, assigning the caste name to anything that is ""cringe""."

"Feminism is not the solution, even though i am a Pregressive Leftist i am not a feminist, because I don't think making both men and women equal would ever work, because as long as thier is a distinction made by society based on sex, their will be discrimination. Its like doing apartheid and believing both white and black people are equal, if we believed all people are equal, we wouldn't have came up with segregating people based on skin colour.

Because if society believes that sex is important enough that there should be two seperate catagories of people based on it, there will be assumptions and roles being thrusted upon these sets of people.  In reality there is nothing as a men or a women, these are just social constructs(must read on social constructs), also known as make-beliefs, also known as 'bhram' in Indian culture, we are told from the age we are born that we are a boy or a girl, solely based on our sex. we are not born girls or boys, we were told to be boys and girls. Gender is social construct and people are born with different sexes, same as people are born with different colours.

There are many other differences between people, but society makes no distinctions based on them, as you mentioned too. Its doesn't matter if you think sex is important enough to base segregation on. And i think we all as a society have came far enough to believe that there shouldn't be discrimination based on what you are born as at birth, be it colour, bloodline, or sex.

What i think and Many Gender Abolitionists like me think, is the solution is that we abolish gender, we are not segregated based on our sex, we are who we choose to be. We take moral responsibilities based on what role we choose to take, If we abolish gender, we are just people with different sexual organs, no one is a man, no one is a women, we are just people. Because gender as it might seem, is not something fundamental to us, societies construct them and we have abolished many things that society constructed before and at that time, those things felt like they are fundamental to world, but they were not and we progressed.

If we want equality we need to get rid of Gender as a whole."

"I am a girl from grade 8th and I want to join the Indian Army. More specifically Infantry which is currently not for women because of many valid reasons. I do agree! But why not let capable women join? Women who are capable of going through that level of mental and physical strain should be allowed to join the Combat Arm. When I put forward this point in society, people called me a feminist and when I show even a spark of ambition, people around me say""Ghar bhi toh sambhalna padega. Posting door ho gayi toh bacchon ko kaun dekhega?"" (You will have to look after the house as well. If you will get posted far away from home, who will look after the children?) Boys in my class mocked me as a feminist. I didn't get the true essence of what is feminism and I took it as an insult as girls and boys alike said it in a disgusted way. People like Dhruv Rathee and Emma Watson enlighten everyone about this. People need to understand that feminism is not synonymous with women hating men. You have explained it beautifully. Hats off!! Now I can wear the ""feminist"" tag with pride. I hope to serve my motherland with valour while being shoulder to shoulder with my male counterparts. I hope the Indian Govt. and society are enlightened and supportive of this by the time I'll be eligible to join. I know that posting this comment might brew up controversies but I want each and everyone to know that afterall, in the eyes of God everyone is equal and that gender equality works both ways. Let's make this world a better place to live and do our part. JAI HIND!

""" PRINCIPLE OF DIVISION OF LABOUR ""

Within the social framework, however, Islam тАФ to the extent that it is both natural and practical тАФ has adopted the division of labor in respect of the sexes, the manтАЩs field of activity being basically external to the home, while the womanтАЩs is domestic. This division, however, has never been intended as a form of discriminatory treatment. Its main purpose has always been to preserve the distinctive characteristics of both sexes, while deploying their respective talents and skills in the most socially useful manner. This enables both sexes to make the best use of their innate capabilities without causing any undue disruption in the family or in society. In modem parlance, this is a form of managerial optimization rather than sexual discrimination. For this principle to be effective, the spheres of activity of men and women have had to be quite different and, of course, separate from each other. That is to say that the manтАЩs field of activity is in the outside world, while the womanтАЩs is in the home. This traditional distinction has been so often cited by feminists as an inhibiting factor in womenтАЩs lives that the true meaning of equality has been lost sight of. After all, it will be the very same virtues in thought, word and deed which will be prerequisites for both sexes to enter Paradise. If the qualities of piety, humility, honesty, patience and compassion are demanded of men, they will in like measure be demanded of women. The fact that men and women function in different spheres has no bearing whatsoever on the ultimate equality тАФ equality in the eyes of God."

"You should have covered the point where men themselves become feminist when it comes to the life of their mothers, sisters and daughters, but show their patriarchy skills on wife and other women. 
And hypocrisy is immense. They want their sisters not to adjust to anything and want their sisters to marry a successful person, but they mock other women who choose financially successful person."

"these women rights are indeed good for our society 
But i thik u should have mentioned a very important person who raised his voice for women rights in the society where female childs were buried alive, females were considered as object to bet upon and at that time he,PROPHET MUHAMMED (SAW) raised his voice for  females 
He gave Women  right to own property, to buy and sell, to inherit, to give charity and to give gifts. It is not permissible for anyone to take a womanтАЩs wealth without her consent.

Women were given the right to a decent life, without facing aggression or being wronged. Women have the right to be educated; in fact it is obligatory to teach them what they need to know and many more

Not from religious point of view but just for the given topic"
Patriarchy and feminism will still remain the part of the discussion which will never end.

"For me feminism is the ensurity of equal rights. For me, both men and women are physically different from each other but they are equal as human. For me, if women do the same work as a man then they deserve the same payment as a man generally gets. A woman can be the president and a man can be one too. A woman can join military if she fulfils her requirement like a man. Feminism doesn't mean women don't need men. Both men and women need each other in life cause humans are social beings. A man can be super affectionate without being questioned and a woman can too. Both deserve the same respect."
I like your video very much
Women can file a fake r@pe case against a man without any proof. Make a video on this topic. There is now a trend in the society for women to file fake cases for money as fake victims.
"I was dying to listen these lines from someone popular on internet,  anyone could have spoken these facts but no one dared to .... the last lines are nothing less than pure truth , feminism was never a comparison between man and woman  and true feminists never supported pseudofeminism,  but the fact is that , every opportunity/law/campaign gets misused in india before it can be used properly , same happened with feminism,  women are still facing issues but now people are so fed up from pseudofeminism that they want to just eradicate the concept of feminism,  the harsh reality is That the reasons of why we need feminism are still much more than the cases of it's misuse , still people on internet are spreading hate between men and women. People keep on saying that women only want Power they do not Want to do hard work and all , but they fail to mention it's origin , women have always Done hard work , but for men household work was not enough , they always Said , kaam hi kya Hai,  ghr pe hi rhna Hai Sara din , the bread winner of the family was always considerd powerful,  and he only took the decisions , he often failed to recognise other's thinking,  emotions and sacrifices that's why women wants to be the bread winner of the family , they want to be independent,  only If men had treated women differently , then this situation would not have happened today , women always craved for love , respect and recognition of her own existence independently,  but men failed to support even the bare minimum due to the patriarchal mindset and fragile ego . As a feminist I clearly know that both woman and man need each other , want each other , we shouldn't let this patriarchy create hatred among us , because evil has no face , either man or woman,  but as in general no one supports the wrong doing  so let's not hate the concept of feminism and females ."

""" WESTERN WOMAN ""

The тАЬNew WomanтАЭ has been proclaimed with a certain regularity for a century or more, Time magazine reminded its readers in a 1972 special edition devoted to an exploration of the status of women in America.1 In 1989 the Scots traveller James F. Muirhead observed that it was man who was subservient in American life because he was тАЬthe hewer of wood, the drawer of water and beast of burden for the superior sexтАЭ (i.e. females). The feminists disagreed, insisting it was they who were dominated. In 1920 American women won the right to vote, and in the 1920s and 1930s began to go to college in considerable numbers, with the expectation of entering the professions. Women believed that тАЬthe battle had been won.тАЭ But, after the vicissitudes of the Great Depression of post-World War II economic boom, the feminist movement was reborn. It was a time of turmoil in American society: President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated in 1963, and the U.S. engagement in the Vietnam War prompted radical protests and widespread questioning of traditional values and institutions, especially among the youth. The тАЬnew feminismтАЭ movement was a phenomenon of the restlessness found in the American woman of the 1960s and 1970s. тАЬBy all rights, the American woman today should be the happiest in history,тАЭ Bonnie Angelo observed in TimeтАЩs 1972 cover story. тАЬShe is healthier that U.S. women have ever been, better educated, more affluent, better dressed, more comfortable, pampered by gadgets. But there is a worm in the apple. She is restless in her familiar familial role; no longer quite content with the homemaker-wife-mother part in which her society has cast her ... Many are in search of a new role that is more independent, less restricted to the traditional triangle of тАФ children, kitchen and church.тАЭ According to Angelo, all but the staunchest advocates of тАЬwomenтАЩs liberationтАЭ agree that womanтАЩs place is different than manтАЩs тАФ but the restless American woman of the 1970s was not so sure just what that place was. The тАЬnew feminismтАЭ increasingly influenced young women to stay single, and transformed marriages by ending once automatic assumptions about womanтАЩs place, stated Angelo. Widespread commercial dissemination of oral contraceptives тАФ the Pill тАФ together with the overturning of state laws prohibiting abortion on demand тАФ a process which began in the mid-1960s, but remains enmired in controversy today -тАФ had the effect of separating sexual relations from the solemn institution of marriage. In 1972, women already made up one third of the U.S. work force, but their pay was much lower than men and they were generally confined to the lower ranking and lower skilled jobs. A soaring divorce rate, however, meant that in 1972 some 20 million Americans lived in households dependent on women as the sole or principal bread winners. A Psychology Today survey at the time found that even among male respondents, 51 percent agreed that тАЬU.S. society exploits women as much as blacks.тАЭ2 In the more colorful phraseology of the American politician, diplomat and author, Booth Luce: тАЬPower, money and sex are the three great American values today, and women have almost no access to power except through their husbands. They can get money mostly through sex -тАФ either legitimate sex, in the form of marriage, or non-married sex.тАЭ3 Indeed, the changes in sexual morality in Europe and the United Status during the 1960s and 1970s were drastic and pervasive. Unlike their parents, many members of the young generation view premarital sex as good instead of bad. A Gallup poll in 1970 in the United States found that three out of four students were indifferent to virginity, or the lack of it, in the person they marry.4 Said British gynecologist John Slome: тАШтАШThe kiss of the 1940s and 1950s has become the sexual intercourse of the тАШ60s and тАШ70s.тАЭ5 The effect on women has been dramatic. For those feminists who decried the fact that womanтАЩs reproductive role made her a тАЬprisoner of sex,тАЭ the Pill appeared as the key to freedom. тАЬWithout the full capacity to limit your own reproduction,тАЭ wrote Lucinda Cisler in Sisterhood Is Powerful, тАЬa womanтАЩs other freedoms are tantalizing mockeries that cannot be exercized.тАЭ6 But in the view of University of Michigan psychologist Judith Bardwick, instead of liberating women to enjoy sex, the Pill has replaced fear of pregnancy with fear of being used. тАЬFar from giving young women the sexual license that men have so long enjoyed, the Pill has caused some women to resent male freedom even more,тАЭ Bardwick stated. тАЬFar from alleviating anxiety over sexual use of the body, the Pill has exacerbated it.тАЭ7 The pill notwithstanding, unwanted pregnancies still occur by the tens of thousands, and the fight over legalization of abortion-on demand remains on center stage. And, the effects of long-term use of the Pill, which acts to prevent ovulation, are now a matter of public record. The changed hormonal balance caused by the Pill is blamed for headaches and weight gain in some women. British and other medical studies have found a connection between the Pill and the formation of blood clots that can cause strokes as well as an increased susceptibility to various forms of uterine cancer. Successive generations of female contraceptives тАФ oral, sub-dermal and all the rest тАФ have become even more potent and questionable in their long-term effect. It should not be surprising to find that as of the 1970s female suicide was on the rise in the United States. Though it has always been the case that more men than women kill themselves, trends had begun to change in certain large cities. In Los Angeles, for example, whereas in 1960 of those who committed suicide 35 percent were women, by 1970 the percentage of women among suicides had jumped to 45 percent.8 Another indication that women had begun to experience more conflict came from a University of Wisconsin study during the same period, which found that women psychiatric patients complained of more anxiety, depression, alienation and inability to cope with stress than did their counterparts of ten years earlier."

My issue lies with people casually throwing around words like feminism and patriarchy without actually knowing the true meaning behind the ideology. I hope this video clears it for them. because for far too long bollywood is trying to condition and manipulate the audience with an agenda of fake feminism. It has become cool to use these words and comment women *tea emoji. from a 12 year old to a 30 year old on Instagram. everyone wants to speak on a topic where they have less idea about.
"Not against Feminism but Dhruv is complete left wing agent 
He showed the statement from garud puran but  not from quran  4:54 that men and women can't be equal .
1. Women wearing hijab forcefully from child ,multiple marriages for men ,women can't have divorce rights etc. 
Didn't showed a woman in hijab but in a bindi 4:47 that's how he simply soft influence people and talks about fact with his propaganda against one specific religion."
"you are the only hope , its strange how people dont hate people who openly called genocide but they triggered suddenly regarding feminism ..the anger against feminism is rooted in mysogyny and sexism .its about fear of losing control on female sexuality and her resources and her labour ( emotional and physical)  many youtubers have made their career around bashing women and feminism because everyone wants to see feminist women to be taugh a lesson ..they derive sadistic pleasure in it ..these are the same people who make fun of men if those men are emotional and have suffered some sexual abuse in past but whenever people discuss about feminsim , these people  use example of these victimised men to downplay the violence on women so that women should stop voicing their problems ..."

"Dear Dhruv sir 
The video was accurately defined the true meaning of feminism and i truly appreciate this but I wanted to share something that not only boys but some girls on social media also have the wrong idea of feminism. Some girls calling themselves feminist have ideology that they can have freedom on everything and yes it is their ideology that they don't need a man and many things. I really felt disappointed after watching this video because i felt it was the half story, there are also some fake chhapri feminist who really don't care about actual rights and actual fights feminist are fighting for rather they are fighting for things which are personally beneficial to them. I really wanted you to talk about that part of the society too. This video is incomplete and i really wanted you and your team to look into this. But the video was very well done."

"Just saying, if feminism really focuses on gender equality, why feminists never raise their voice against the bias against male in divorce matters, why they don't raise voice against how easily the r*pe laws can be used to falsely accuse a male into a case esp in POSCO, why not raise voice against the fact that govt exams like JEE takes less fees from female students, why they don't raise voice against the fact that buses tickets are free for girls in some regions, shouldn't tickets be free for poors regardless of their gender.... If all Of these were otherway round people like you would hav gone crazy...
There are a lot of things in society which goes bias against women and make them look small, I completely agree but the same happens other way round too like how teachers gives harsher punishments to boys in school for a thing compared to girls.... The Difference is thnx to feminism govt has removed most of laws that are against women which is good... But the other way round is yet to happen as thnx to feminism it never gets a loud voice... If crciketers like shami has suffered so much becoz of how indian society and laws acts against male in divorce matters, just think how problematic this must be in lower level

Even those stupid alphas and tate fanbase never talks about these issue men face they are just busy with their toxic patriarchal mindset

Feminism played a huge role to provide women equal rights in past and I totally respect that, not only they helped women to get the rights but even helped men as you said.... But there is no need of feminism now esp in national level (in rural yes)... Coz u can't just say feminism means Gender equality... Better to use the literal world ""gender equality"" itself instead...."
Toxic feminism is a threat to this world and it drags attention from some real issues which some women are facing in this world.
"OPINION: I agree with 90% of the things you say here, but not completely on the part where you say males are females are similar therefore they should get equal rights. No, I believe if we are similar we should get similar rights, I believe that the biggest inequality is to treat unequal things equally. I believe in equity not complete equality. For example, men and women must have different dressing standards, we can not let women to move around topless in the names of giving equal rights as men, if i am hiring someone, and i see a man and a women and the man is more skilled but the women is suffering financially, i will recruit the women not in the name of equality but equity, if I'm recruiting someone for military purposes, i wouldn't hire equal amount of women in the name of equality as biologically men are more capable in this aspect, i wouldn't let a women suffer beyond her biological capabilities and wise versa. I believe rights should be equal in maximum areas and we need to have a objective reasoning with which we decide which rights should be given for women and for men such that it is providing justice for both genders. I believe in feminism if it means equity not complete A to Z equality as it can be unjust and unfair to women and men. Correct me if I'm wrong."

"So glad you made this video ! It astonishes me that even my own mother cant understand these points when i try to talk to her about anything ! as a guy i have to suffer through all this shitt, and every girl who literally asks you your bank balance or govt. job status is not a feminist ! This is such a huge problem and both guys and girls are biggest culprits of it ! We live in an era of toxic andrew tits masculinity and onlyfans feminism ! I honestly dont even feel depresso being alone anymore ! Its just so tiring ! people dont even wanna listen to you , let alone make them understand ! and 1 thing i think you missed slightly when you said ""tradition"" is religion is a huge part of it , and seeing how much weight we give to religion in our lives over simple humanitism is a clear example of how hard it is to deal with this issue ! I recently met a girl and talked to her what kind of a guy she wanted ! she told me she want someone who dont have a problem with her earning money and working and dont want him to earn more than me to assert any sort of dominance in our relationship, but after a while she again countered this and told me ""well financial stability is very important to her"" and she wouldnt wanna marry anyone who is earning even equal to her, so probably a guy who is earning lot more than her, See the confusion ? , and just like that men are fuckin confused as well ! ""Arre bhai house wife is the best , tu paisa kamaega wo ghar ka kaam kregi"" Ok fine ! but these guys are also the same people who have trouble accepting that then all your money belongs to hers as well just as equally , if she wants to spend some of it on herself why is a basis of fights between them ? yes honesty is important and both should manage their finances together ! Tum chahte ho ladki kamayi na kre but kuch kharche bhi na kre ? aab saare paise sirf tumhare ho gaye ? Yea i know there are shitt women out there , and lot of fake rape and domestic violence cases to just snatch property from men and dont wanna work at all themselves, But again ! If you say ""saari ladkiya aisi he hoti hai"" then accept ""saare ladke bhi aise rapist or violent he hote hain""."

"thing is feminism is like a change in society ways...for it to work for both genders, both need to help eachother...just like woman should not expect her husband to be atm machine"
Hazrat ayesha r.a. greatest scholar of islam. Hazrat khadijah a powerful business women for her time. Inheritance rights already given to women in quran. Queen of sheeba mentioned in quran a powerful queen of a vast kingdom of her time and a woman of wisdom and intelligence. Quran no where forbids women from having access to education and jobs provided that modesty probity isnt compromised. A woman a wife is obliged to be obedient to her husband provided that her husband fulfills her basic needs clothes food etc. If not then she isnt obliged to obey him.

Some patriarchal people scare from feminism.. because they know about their capabilities...
And Nowdays some patriarchal men are continuing their thoughts in the name of religion , dharam and culture...the most of the thing is that in our hindu religion this discrimination were never ever written...and some show cringe reels what boys are also doing
And yes this kind of men or people cannot progress in their life ...their life start from social medial and end in social media.....

"You miss few points:
1) Evolution science: Gender roles.Huge issue 
2) Psychological issues: Male and female attraction 
3) Racism in feminism 
4) War issue 
5)Voting issue: Most women influenced by their male counter part in terms of voting. We all understand  such thing
In a ideal situation feminism is really good.But We are human. We need leader.We need competition. And physical advantage and disadvantage always play big roles.Just calling myself feminist won't help anyone. So many fem*nist writer already talked about how much itтАЩs problematic. 
If you donтАЩt want patr*archal society, you have to choose matriarchy. You need leadership. ItтАЩs not that easy.
ItтАЩs not only in maintaining house or talking about bad things.We have deeper problem. 
Most company says they need more female workers because men can work outside but women can't.And then they create more competition among men. 
You insult male su*cide. Jobless, rejection in relationship, no help from society and family also lead huge suicide. Not everything related to patriarchy man.
I want women to have jobs and education. But they give less skilled women the scholarship and job Because they are women.That's not feminism."

"While I largely agree with what you said in this video. I believe the misandrists masquerading as feminist are also a reality now and these people are not an ignorable minority. You could find easily find such podcasts with Lacs of views of youtube. Similarly, there are several misogynists wearing the cape of men's rights activist with Lacs of views on YouTube. Due to power of social media, these anti-social people have gained an immense following and power and need to be called out.

Also, I don't like the fact that whenever you have to call out some indecent people you call them Chhapri. Chhapri is a very backward and oppressed caste and people need more awareness about them. I believe you should also address this in one of your videos. There are several derogatory terms and slangs on internet that are basically an oppressed caste or sect that peole don't know about."
Sir aap ka minute me thumbnail change ho raha hai
But equality is impossible in reality
Thank you Dhruv sir. I really needed this video content quality because of my topic in sociology in college which I was really unable to understand.
""" THE PROBLEMS OF CHILDREN BORN THROUGH ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION ""

The goal of the feminist movement was to make women equal to men in every respect. But this did not happen in practice. The feminist movement has completely failed in achieving its real objective. An American lady, Ti-Grace Atkinson says: тАЬThere is no movement. Movement means going some place, and the movement is not going anywhere. It hasnтАЩt accomplished anything.тАЭ23 Due to this experience, feminist extremists in western countries demand a complete withdrawal from dependence on men, including sexual ties. Village Voice columnist Jill Johnston, for example, insists that тАЬfeminism is lesbianism,тАЭ and that it is only when women do not rely upon men to fulfill their sexual needs that they are finally free of masculine control.24 Living together like husbands and wives is not so simple a matter. Many problems have to be faced. For instance, if the couples want a child, how to find one? Modern medical science has provided the answer in the form of artificial insemination. Two women from Holland, Paula Deijs and Jeanine Haaksman lived together like husband and wife. Then they felt a desire to have a child. For this purpose they contacted the Lydden Institute of Birth Control. Their first attempt did not succeed, but in the second attempt Paula Deijs became pregnant. Through the semen of an unknown person a child was born to them. The child was named Thomas. But after the birth of the child they realized they again were in need of the same тАЬmanтАЭ whom they had shunned to become lesbians. The women are sensitive to the fact that Thomas needs men as role models. Uncles, a grandfather, brothers-in-law and male neighbours are encouraged to visit frequently. тАЬWe have a good friend not too far from here that we have chosen to be a father image for Thomas,тАЭ says Haaksman. тАЬWeтАЩll send Thomas over to him for all the technical instructions.тАЭ25 Providing a тАЬfatherтАЭ to Thomas in this artificial way is in no way an alternative to a real father. It is certain that some strangeness must remain between such тАЬsons and fathers.тАЭ And when Thomas grows up, this unconscious strangeness will turn into conscious strangeness. Thomas will know his mother, but not his father. This vacuum in ThomasтАЩs life will produce different kinds of mental complications, which will most probably make it impossible for him to become a useful member of society. It is as if in the system of lesbianism there is scope for producing girls but not boys. Even then, to produce a girl, lesbians will depend upon the same man whom they had rejected in order to have their own independent ways. It is easy to deviate from the system of nature but the price that has to be paid for such deviation is too high for an individual or a society."

Also i just realized that most of the people who had problem with so called feminist on the issue of girl slapping poor guy had argument that what if at that place was a boy and that boy slaps a girl then hundreds of so called feminist wake up and start tweeting but on the issue of girl hitting boy no one came forward like not even real feminist people also. Thats where the major disappoint was. It was not against feminism rather it was against so called feminist people from the society.

"why do you show half statement, the actual teachings found in the Garuda Purana regarding the duties of a virtuous and devoted wife go like this. ""A virtuous wife is one who obeys her husband's orders, but this obedience does not entail blindly accepting wrong or immoral actions or decisions made by the husband. Instead, even in such situations, it is the duty of the wife to guide her husband towards righteousness and help him discern between right and wrong, thereby fulfilling her role as a supportive and morally upright life partner.""

This interpretation emphasizes the importance of mutual respect, understanding, and communication in marital relationships, highlighting the wife's responsibility to contribute positively to her husband's moral development and overall well-being. It promote the idea that a harmonious and fulfilling marriage is based on mutual cooperation, support, and ethical conduct by both partners. but you cut the statement to fit your needs."

Every movie with female lead acters is not necessarily a feminist movie. Same as every movie with a male lead is not necessarily misogynist. It can just be a normal movie with normal story. People think just because all lead actors are girls that means its feminist.  Nobody claimed series like 4 more shots as a feminist series. Its just a series about 4 friends and their life. Like dil chata hai or ZNMD. A movie with a feminist topic like thappad and pink are actual feminist movies. Their leads can be anyone. Its the topic and story that matters.
You're absolutely right.....!!! Only chhapris target Feminism even when there's no connection to it.

"21:15 here comes the main point of the video. Feminism by definition is indeed about equality but the modern interpretation promotes something else. Bad things are being promoted in the name of feminism these days. The old feminism was fine, but the modern one is too crazy. It encourages exactly such type of behaviour and more. It promotes hatred against men, even tho that is not feminism but still it can be seen happening in the name of feminism. I think the 2 terms feminism and modern feminism need to be talked about separately, because if you donтАЩt divide feminism into old feminism and modern feminism and praise тАЬfeminismтАЭ in general pretending that only one type of feminism exists, then you will associate old feminism with modern day craziness of feminism, causing people to hate real feminism in general, which is supposed to be about equality. I believe you should have talked about the bad values which modern day тАЬfeminism тАЬ promotes, more"

Hi
Dhruv is a simp
""" WOMAN VS MAN ""

In view of the divine law of balance, let us consider the relationship between man and woman. According to divine law, this relationship was set up on the principle of the division of labor, i.e. it is the responsibility of the man to carry out tasks outside the home, while the woman takes charge of tasks within the home. The QurтАЩan states that тАЬmen are the protectors and maintainers of women.тАЭ20 This does not make a man a womanтАЩs superior, or her master. This only means that in running a home and bringing up a family, it is for the man, with his more active capabilities, to earn a living, deal with all official matters, and, when called upon, defend his country. A man is by nature more suited to such tasks, and that is why it is in the nature of things that they should be his responsibilities and not womanтАЩs. The word qawwam in the above verse is an intensive form of qaтАЩim meaning, тАЬone who is responsible for or takes care of a thing or a person.тАЭ Thus the use of this word is indicative of the wisdom of the division of labor rather than the superiority of man over woman. It should be conceded that if the woman finds herself in a position of responsibility in running the home, it is because her more passive nature, her talent for household tasks, her gentleness and affection all fit her admirably for domesticity, to which she is certainly better adapted than her male counterpart. Since time immemorial life had been equably systemized by this division of labor. Earning a living had most often meant hunting, farming, fishing, working in orchards, transporting merchandise for barter or trading, all tasks physically difficult to perform, and, therefore, better and more easily done by men. While men were thus engaged, it was simply more practical for women to stay at home and manage the household. But with the advent of the industrial revolution, conditions were created which tended to break up this natural order, for now jobs came into existence which, to some extent, were suitable for women, and, since tradition in western countries did not require women to segregate themselves from men and live in seclusion, they came out of their homes and began working in offices and factories. Gradually, the traditional pattern of living began to change. Men were no longer the sole breadwinners: women had begun to share that responsibility. With economic independence came the realization in women that they should тАЬbreak out of the shackles forged for them by menтАЭ to make new and independent lives for themselves. This trend in thinking eventually paved the way for the womenтАЩs liberation movement. Since feminism was given its first impetus by the industrial revolution, тАЬwomenтАЩs libтАЭ began in those countries where industrialization had first made its appearance. The first noteworthy book to demand equal rights for women was published in London in 1792. Authored by Mary Wollstonecraft, it was entitled, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. The industrial revolution came later to America and that is why the womenтАЩs liberation movement did not begin there until the nineteenth century. With the progress of the industrial revolution, womenтАЩs liberation gained momentum, reaching its zenith in the 20th century. The upholders of this movement maintained that the cause of the difference existing between men and women in societies with ancient traditions lay not in nature but in a man-made social framework. Their contention was that a woman could do anything that a man could do, but that outdated social customs prevented her from coming into her own. They held that, once given the opportunity to demonstrate her capabilities, a woman would be able to work shoulder to shoulder with men in every walk of life. In no respect would she lag behind. This movement is now over two hundred years old and, in modem developed countries, it has been so successful that neither the law nor tradition now places the slightest obstacle in the path of women who wish to step into the shoes of men. Yet women still lag far behind men, there being very few instances of their having actually placed themselves on an equal footing with them. Encyclopaedia Britannica has this to say on the subject of women in modern society: In the economic sphere women who work outside the home are heavily concentrated in the lowest paying work and that having the lowest status. Women also earn less than men in the same kinds of jobs. The median pay of women workers in the U.S. was 60 percent that of men in 1982. In Japan the percentage of average pay was 55. Politically, women are greatly underrepresented in national and local government and in political parties.21 Today the social boundaries set by time-honored conventions have broken down, and all countries now have laws favoring equality of the sexes. Yet modern woman still finds herself on a lower rung than man, not having been able to achieve equal status in any of the economically or professionally important areas of modern living. This state of affairs would appear to indicate that, contrary to the womenтАЩs libbersтАЩ way of thinking, social conditioning cannot be blamed for the centuries-old difference in the status of men and women. If this had been so, surely by the end of the 20th century women would have been enjoying an equal status with men. Obviously, we must search for the reasons elsewhere."

For example a man soldier will preferred over woman in war or border duty
Similarly a male labour will be better for tough works than women

Naturally kids emotionally feel more close to their mother
So the house hold is already a job that's why  it should be a woman choice either she want to job or not.
The film producer and pornography producers will support feminism in general way because they need woman to come out and make prophit for them by the label of freedom 

For me it is logically good if my sister, mother or wife go for a job because it will increase the income but I would not want because it is an extra burden on them."

There is one more topic which needs to be discussed and no one is talking about - most of the schools and teachers  judge a child through marks . Which is totally wrong. Getting less marks compare to any other  particular student does'nt mean that you're less intelligent. Marks really dont define any students worth . Can you please make a video on this topic talking about what kind of pressure this creates on the student and many other related issues

"History of word AURAT

The word ""aurat"" originally comes from the Arabic word ""awrah"". In Arabic, the words awrah or awrat denote defectiveness, imperfection, blemish, weakness, genitalia, loins, private parts, pudendum flaw, defect and fault.[3] According to Nurhan G├ЬNER avrat/avret in Turkish is borrowed from Arabic and is not related to Old Turkic uragut.[5] The word is used in the Quran to denote ""privacy"", ""vulnerability"" and ""nakedness"" as well.[3][better source needed][6][7] Ahar├┤n Layi┼б' book on family laws among Druze attributes a quote to al-Tanukhi that says ""..Women are all nakedness (awrat) and all nakedness should be covered""[8] Moshe Piamenta, in his book ""Islam in Everyday Arabic Speech"", notes that in the language of the Bedouin, synecdochic usage of word 'awrat' denotes 'woman'.[9] In the Kurdish language, the word 'Aurat' for women is spelled as 'avarat' where as in (Ottoman) Turkish it is spelled as 'Avret'.[10]

Before entering South Asia, it was used in the Persian language in Iran to mean 'woman'. In Mohammad Moin's Persian dictionary, awrah has two different meanings: ""nakedness"" and ""young woman"". But subsequently, Iranians started avoiding the word ""aurat"" for 'women', due to its meaning of ""nakedness"". In (Ottoman) Turkish, the word 'avret' was used more for common married or adult women, whereas the word ""hatun"" was used for more respected women.[10] In Ottoman times any unmarried adolescent girl was called ""kiz"" and her silence was assumed as consent for marriage purposes. Kiz were freer and less controlled, but once married and considered avret their mobility and sexuality came under drastic social control, so that they would not engage in adultery, in order to preserve male right of lineage and patriarchal honor.[10] According to Heidi Stein avrat / avret meaning woman (Arab.тАЬтАШaurat, privy partsтАЭ) is among 78 early (9th to11th centuries) Arabic cultural words found it's way in everyday Turkish language during first Arabic linguistic import stage through Persian language.[11][12] In Turkish since the twentieth century, use of word avret has been limited to intimate body parts.[10] According to Pashayeva Gunel Bakhsheyish kizi and Musayeva Ilaha Ilham kizi (2019) The word ovrat in Arabic means a married woman, who has a husband; wifeтАУ avrat in Turkish language, avrad in Gagauz language, arvad in Azerbaijani.[13]:тАК34,тАК35тАК Kizi (2019) says sufix ""╪╣╪з╪▒"" [╩╗─Бr] {noun} meaning shame (also: disgrace, dishonor, dishonour) too might have come from Arabic. The alternate etymological origin for 'arvad' may be arva (tare) meaning tearing of daughter's relationship from parents while getting married and it's root may be from Mongolian language lexems abra-arba-arva the root ab-av means magic, conjuring in Mongolian language"

This is so true. I have seen the men in my family to pretend to be bold and tough but are actually crying inside. It is so sad that even men who follows patriarchy like their religion will be banished by the same patriarchy with just a drop of tear from their eyes.
You changed my mind sir though I was not a toxic masculine type man or that alpha type man you talked about. Somehow I thought that these toxic feminism is wrong and should be avoided but I never knew that was not feminism at all. This video taught me that There shouldn't be any term as toxic feminism. what we call as toxic feminism is just wrong. It is just a crime. And she should be punished. But the real feminism that you talked about in this video should be promoted and should get more limelight so that both men and women can get those benefit. Huge fan sir. Huge respect for you.

"brother , i appreciate you for making this video, however after seeing the video, tbh i felt many things are way off. i am quite not sure if its because of i might have some confirmation biases.
I used to promote feminism quite affirmatively and used tell i am a feminist proudly , but not anymore.

i am currently also seeing the other side of the story aswell.
i can proudly say certain aspect of feminism is right and currently i am kind of rejecting the notion of patriarchy itself.
Some of the things that are described in whatever podcast sounds very legit. 

So i would definitely suggest to break out of the echochamber listen other side of the story aswell without rejecting it over our confirmation biases, there is some value in it.
this suggestion is applicable to either side of this issue."

Men work more hours and also more difficult jobs, i am sorry if it offends you but it is the truth, other than that i agree with dhruv raathi, he is amazing.

There are some jobs for women and some jobs for men.

 Muje stress bhi ho gya tha. Jbki mene unme kuch reply nhi kiye ki mera bhi bhai h so i can't say anything wrong about men but wo galat ladke the. Patriarchal soch k the. Yha tak ki kaafi sare followers wala channel Instagram pr wo ladka bhi aise hi bate krra tha. Ab muje realise hua ki jese andhbhakt hai vese hi patriarchal society bhi hai. Jo apko darayegi. Galat bolenge. Taaki aap (girls) aage na bde. M kbhi nhi chahti ki ladko k sath galat ho bs Hume hmare rights equality chaiye"

ЁЯШВ This guy is part of the problem. I thought he is gonna talk about male issues for once but he still twisted it as it is a man's fault and women are somehow always victims. Wow. Guys like this are the reason men are not opening up about their problems.
"The well-known American novelist and a leader of the feminist movement, Rhoda Lerman, visited India in 1987. The Times of India published her interview, which is reproduced here: тАЬI come with very bad news,тАЭ says Rhoda Lerman. Speaking on the changing role of women in society, she revealed that 77 percent of the poor in America are women and children. The reason she offers is the high wage differential between the earnings of men and women. Women earn 62 percent of what men earn, merely because of the тАЬpink-collaredтАЭ jobs offered to them. тАЬEqual opportunities and equal pay for equal work are just a myth,тАЭ she declares. Women have been able to infiltrate only the lower and middle management and are offered innumerable jobs in food chains and the secretarial cadres. This discrimination, she believes, is due to the male bias which works against women, branding them as тАШundependable, since they go in for maternity leave and have children.тАЩ Although 96 percent of the working women have children, only 67 percent of them can enjoy maternity leave, without fear of jeopardising their jobs. However, seniority almost always suffers, says Ms. Lerman. тАЬMaternity and child care are the cause of high wage differentials,тАЭ she adds, тАЬeconomic reality having nothing to do with spiritual equality.тАЭ Activists had clamored for sexual equality and abortion rights and won them, without anticipating the economic backlash that would ensue. With radical feminism accepted as the code, women are treated as equal, without any concessions to their biological differences. For instance, one out of two marriages in America is ending in divorce, with the responsibility of childcare devolving on the mother alone. Alimony and maintenance are merely laws, rarely put into practice. A mere 5-10 percent of the men pay maintenance, and that too, only for the first year. For the rest, the burden is borne solely by the mother. Thus, the quality of life of a divorced woman reduces by 73 percent and that of a man increases by 43 percent. Single households, headed by women trying to play the role of тАЬsuper-moms,тАЭ are on the increase, she revealed. In the next ten years, therefore, 40-50 percent of the children will be living in female-headed households, an unhealthy phenomenon, which has its repercussions in increased suicides amongst children. тАЬDue to a lapse in the dependency structure, suicide is becoming endemic amongst children,тАЭ she said. Socialist feminism, which takes into account the intrinsic differences between men and women, is the call of the hour, Ms. Lerman believes. We have had an excess of the American dream тАФ of a husband who works, a house in the suburbs, two children, two cars and a mother who stays at home and bakes cookies. With the family structure falling apart, she feels that only government support in the form of day-care centers, maternity leave benefits and subsidies to override the economic limitations of single women can hold the social fabric together. тАЬOtherwise, our victories will be merely Pyrrhic victories,тАЭ34 she predicts, similar, perhaps to the freedom experienced on the funeral pyre.тАЩ35 The feminist leader has acknowledged that the successes of feminism are little short of Pyrrhic victories. This is the most appropriate word to describe the victory of modem woman. She secured тАЬequalityтАЭ after a long and hard struggle. In the process, however, of achieving this imaginary equality, she has lost everything. Ms. Lerman feels that only large-scale government support can compensate for the deprivation of western women. This means placing herself under the guardianship of a government, which is completely in the hands of man. Woman was not willing to accept the guardianship of man at home; at her own cost, she has had to come to terms with the guardianship of men in the government."
I completely agree with Dhruv Rathee about feminism but why can't you use the same agressive tone for pseudo feminists which you use for chhapri boys
"I don't agree with all the points
This is how America's gender problems started and it is now where it is
It's not the patriarchal society that makes all the men how he is.
Its the biology of a man
I am all for equality don't get me wrong but I am just saying both are different. Built different, have different roles, can perform different task."

You ask at 25:51 'Kya kisi feminist ne is ladki ko support dikhaya?'. Let me remind the definition of feminism you gave earlier in the video. The question should be 'Kyu kisi feminist ne is ladki ka bahiskar nahi kiya?' Equal rights ki baat haina? Woh ladke k rights k liye kyu nahi khade hue feminist log?

Before I watch this video I want to say feminism is right but as not all people are same so few use it in their favour. We should be thoughtful of how to handle it when someone misuse it but also shouldn't get against it in such cases just because of few bad examples.
